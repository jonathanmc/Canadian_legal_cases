    claiming that the 2005 August Agreement was an impermissible disposition of
    Romandales interest in the Lands under the COAs (the </span><strong>2007

    changed the timelines and development prospects for the Lands. Development of
    the Snider Farm was delayed until 2021-2031 and of the McGrisken Farm until
    2031-2051. In addition, the Snider Farm was newly earmarked for employment use,
    which would prevent residential development. </span></p>

    in the fall of 2010. In an attempt to settle them before trial, Fram, Kerbel
    and Romandale attended a judicial mediation in September 2010. At the
    mediation, the three parties reached an agreement in principle. That agreement
    included a statement of the parties intention that the purchase and sale of
    Romandales remaining interest in the Lands to Kerbel would take place after
    the Lands obtained SPA (the </span><strong>Statement</strong><span lang=EN-US>).
    Romandale later withdrew from the settlement agreement. However, in December
    2010, Fram and Kerbel settled the matters between them and entered into a
    settlement agreement (the </span><strong>Settlement Agreement</strong><span
lang=EN-US>). It is important to note that para. 5 of the Settlement Agreement

    judges key determination was that Kerbel repudiated the 2005 August Agreement
    when it entered into the Settlement Agreement because para. 5 of the Settlement
    Agreement stated the parties intention that the purchase and sale of the
    Remaining Interest would take place after SPA. The trial judge found that
    Romandale had accepted the repudiation and concluded that the 2005 August
    Agreement was at an end. Accordingly, Romandale was excused from performing its
    remaining obligations under the 2005 August Agreement. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Romandale sells Fram an undivided 5% interest in the Lands and the
    parties enter into two identical sets of agreements, one set for each farm
    property. Each set consisted of three documents: the </span><strong>COA</strong><span
lang=EN-US>, which sets out the terms and conditions on which Romandale and
    Fram, as co-owners, hold title to the Lands; the Construction Management
    Agreement (</span><strong>CMA</strong><span lang=EN-US>), under which Fram
    was to construct and sell residential units on the Lands, once the Lands
    achieved </span>SPA<span lang=EN-US>; and the Development Management Agreement
    (</span><strong>DMA</strong><span lang=EN-US>), which governed the
    development process for the Lands. Bordeaux Developments (Ontario) Inc. (</span><strong>Bordeaux</strong><span

lang=EN-US>Of these agreements, the COAs are the most significant for these
    appeals. The buy-sell provision in s. 5.07 of the COAs permits a co-owner,
    under certain conditions, to tender on the other an offer to sell its entire
    interest in the Lands and, at the same time, an offer to buy the others entire
    interest in the Lands on the same terms as the offer to sell. The non-tendering
    party must choose whether to buy out the tendering party or sell its interest.
    The buy-sell is available once SPA is obtained for the Lands or the DMAs are
    terminated.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Development of the Lands depended on obtaining planning approval,
    including appropriate amendments to the official plan. These changes are made
    to the secondary plan, which provides more detailed policies for the
    development of a specific area. The process of obtaining development approval
    for specific lands is known as SPA. This is reflected in s. 5.07(a) of the COAs
    which defines SPA as an amendment of the official plan of the Town of Markham applicable

    breach the COAs when it entered into the 2005 August Agreement and dismissed
    the 2007 Action accordingly. In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge held
    that: (1) the Conditional Provision was not a Disposition in breach of s.
    5.03 of the COAs; (2) Romandale was not obliged to give Fram notice and a copy
    of the 2005 August Agreement so, if it did fail to disclose the same (which
    Romandale disputed), the failure was not a breach of the COAs; and, (3)
    Romandale did not breach the COAs by ceding control over the development of the
    Lands to Kerbel under the 2005 August Agreement (Reasons, at paras. 187-91,
    204-05). </span></p>

    Romandale continued to own its Remaining Interest in the Lands and for all
    practical purposes continued to control the development of the Lands in the
    same way as before (Reasons, at para. 226). Accordingly, she dismissed the 2008

    Co-operative Services Ltd. v. W.T. Goodwin Ltd.</em><span lang=EN-US>, [1985] 1
    S.C.R. 54, the trial judge set out the following legal principles for estoppel
    by representation, at para. 359:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The essence of estoppel is
    representation by words or conduct <u>which induces detrimental reliance</u>. A
    more exhaustive definition is offered in Spencer Bower and Turner, <em>The Law
    Relating to Estoppel by Representation</em> (3rd ed., 1977), at p. 4:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>where one person (the
    representor) has made a representation to another person (the representee)
    in words or by acts or conduct, or (being under a duty to the representee to
    speak or act) by silence or inaction, <u>with the intention (actual or
    presumptive), and with the result, of inducing the representee on the faith of
    such representation to alter his position to his detriment</u>, the
    representor, in any litigation which may afterwards take place between him and
    the representee, is estopped, as against the representee, from making, or
    attempting to establish by evidence, any averment substantially at variance
    with his former representation, if the representee at the proper time, and in
    the proper manner, objects thereto. [Emphasis in the Reasons.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge described Fram and Kerbels
    position on estoppel as follows. They argued that, prior to the Settlement Agreement
    and for a number of years following it, Romandale consistently took the
    position that: (1) the 2005 August Agreement was valid and enforceable; and (2)
    if Fram did not consent to Romandales sale of its Remaining Interest to
    Kerbel, the buy-sell in the 2005 August Agreement would be performed after SPA.
    They asserted that Fram relied on Romandales position in entering into the
    Settlement Agreement, thereby compromising its claim to the Lands by 50%, and
    that Kerbel also compromised its position in reliance on Romandales position. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Romandale contended that Fram and Kerbel
    overstated its positions and stripped them of the context in which they were
    taken. The trial judge agreed, for the following reasons. In the 2007 Action,
    Romandales primary position was that the 2005 August Agreement did not breach
    the COAs and, as a result, the 2005 August Agreement was valid. The trial judge
    acknowledged that Romandale did take the position that the buy-sell in the 2005
    August Agreement would be triggered after SPA because the buy-sell in the COAs
    could only be triggered after SPA. However, she noted that Romandales position
    on the buy-sell in the COAs was mistaken and the parties shared this mistaken
    understanding until 2015 when Romandale rectified its mistake and amended its
    pleadings. At that point, Romandale asserted that the 2005 August Agreement was
    unenforceable because Kerbel repudiated it by entering into the Settlement
    Agreement. However, the trial judge stated that this assertion did not change
    Romandales primary position: Romandale continued to defend the 2007 Action on
    the basis that the 2005 August Agreement did not breach the COAs. She said that
    Romandale did not backtrack from its primary position: it was responding to new
    factual events that carried legal consequences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the issue of reliance, the trial judge said
    that Frams only evidence was a bald assertion by Mr. Giannone that he relied
    on Romandales position that the 2005 August Agreement was enforceable. She
    said this evidence was totally unreliable and could not be accepted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In any event, the trial judge concluded, any
    reliance would have been totally unreasonable as Romandale objected to the
    Settlement Agreement before it was entered into. Therefore, Fram and Kerbel
    proceeded at their own risk. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Repudiation of the 2005 August Agreement (Reasons, at paras.
    30546)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge stated the legal principles
    governing repudiation as follows, at para. 305:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The applicable law is not in dispute. A contract may be said to
    be repudiated when one party acts in a way, by words or conduct, that evinces
    an intent to no longer be bound by the contract. Only a very substantial breach
    will amount to a repudiation. As the court stated in <em>Jedfro Investments</em> at para. 21, having little regard for an agreement does not establish that a
    party is repudiating the agreement. Repudiation arises where the innocent
    party is deprived of substantially the whole benefit of its agreement. When
    faced with repudiation, the innocent party may elect to treat the contract as
    at an end, relieving the parties from further performance. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>She concluded that the Settlement Agreement
    materially and substantially changed the deal in the 2005 August Agreement for
    the following reasons. Because Kerbel was no longer at liberty to cause
    Romandale to trigger the buy-sell before SPA and Fram was no longer at liberty
    to consent before SPA, the result of the Settlement Agreement was to tie up the
    Lands until after SPA, then decades away or more, at a fixed price, without
    paying Romandale for the Lands and while leaving Romandale with all the risks
    and liabilities. She said this entirely devalued the Conditional Provision,
    given the time value of money, and that Kerbel shifted all of the risk of the
    Lands to Romandale by tying up the Lands indefinitely without any compensation
    to Romandale.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also concluded that, by entering
    into the Settlement Agreement, Kerbel demonstrated an intent not to be bound by
    the ongoing performance of the 2005 August Agreement. It wanted instead to
    abide only by its new Settlement Agreement with Fram.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge determined that Kerbels repudiation of the 2005
    August Agreement deprived Romandale of substantially the whole benefit of that
    agreement. In making this determination, the trial judge considered each
    transaction in the 2005 August Agreement on its own and stated that there was
    no dispute that by the time of the Settlement Agreement, Romandale had not
    received any of the benefit of the Conditional Provision. She said that all of
    the transactions in the 2005 August Agreement were either of no benefit to
    Romandale or of relatively modest benefit when compared to the Conditional
    Provision. She concluded that performance of the other parts of the 2005 August
    Agreement could not represent Romandale receiving substantially the whole of
    the benefit of that agreement (at para. 336).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that Romandale had accepted Kerbels
    repudiation. In making this finding, she said: (1) by February 2011, Kerbel
    knew that Romandale was no longer acting in accordance with the 2005 August
    Agreement; and (2) in a letter dated February 9, 2011, from counsel for
    Romandale to counsel for Kerbel, Romandale took the position that Kerbel had
    breached the 2005 August Agreement and it was considering its rights (at
    para. 338).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Having found that Romandale accepted Kerbels repudiation, the trial
    judge concluded that the parties were relieved of their obligations under the
    Conditional Provision and it was at an end. Consequently, the Conditional
    Provision was not enforceable against Romandale.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also concluded that Kerbel
    breached its duty of good faith and its fiduciary duty in acting as Romandales
    agent, by fettering its discretion in the Settlement Agreement as to when to
    cause Romandale to trigger the buy-sell. Further, she was of the view that by
    entering into the&nbsp;Settlement Agreement, Kerbel breached the time is of
    the essence clause in the 2005 August Agreement and the clause stipulating
    that the conditions precedent&nbsp;were&nbsp;for the mutual benefit of the
    parties. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Frustration (Reasons, at paras. 347-49)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In light of the trial judges determination on
    repudiation, it was not necessary that she consider Romandales alternative
    argument that the 2005 August Agreement was rendered unenforceable on account
    of frustration. However, the trial judge stated, had it been necessary to
    consider it, she was persuaded that the 2005 August Agreement was frustrated. </span></p>

    Ellis-Don Construction Ltd.</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2001 SCC 58, [2001] 2 S.C.R.
    943, at para. 53, the trial judge said that frustration occurs when a situation
    has arisen for which the parties made no provision in the contract and
    performance of the contract becomes a thing radically different from that
    which was undertaken by the contract (at para. 348).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge said it was clear that when the
    2005 August Agreement was entered into, both Ms. Roman-Barber and Mr. Kerbel
    expected that SPA was only years away, not decades away. Unforeseen planning
    changes resulted in SPA being delayed for decades and the farms being put on
    different development tracks. In addition, the Snider Farm could be developed
    only as employment lands, not for residential use. These changes were beyond
    the control of the parties and rendered the performance of the Conditional
    Provision radically different from that to which the parties agreed.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Mistake (Reasons, at paras. 350-53)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Romandale argued that if obtaining SPA was a
    prerequisite to triggering the buy-sell, the Conditional Provision was
    unenforceable because Kerbel and Romandale were mistaken, when entering into
    the 2005 August Agreement, as to the time horizon within which SPA could be
    achieved. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge accepted this argument and found
    the Conditional Provision void for mistake. She said the following, at para.
    351:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Both Romandale and Kerbel, in making a time is of the essence
    clause, fixing a purchase price of $160,000 per acre, and providing for the
    conditions precedent for their mutual benefit, without any sunset clause or
    otherwise set[ting] the closing date, were operating on the mistaken
    understanding that SPA would occur within a relatively short time period, and
    certainly not decades after the [2005 August Agreement] was entered into.</p>

    161, at para. 23, the trial judge set aside the 2005 August Agreement contract
    for common mistake as, in all the circumstances, it would be unconscientious
    for a contracting party to avail itself of the legal advantage it had obtained.
    She agreed with Romandale that it would be unconscionable and commercially
    absurd to enforce the Conditional Provision or even consider it valid and
    enforceable since the parties would never have agreed to its terms, especially
    the fixed price per acre of the Lands, had they known that the timeline for SPA
    would change so drastically and  be pushed out decades in the future. </span></p>

    direct comparison approach to provide their opinions on land values. The
    direct comparison approach determines value based on an analysis of sales of

    FLAWS</a></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before turning to the issues raised on appeal, I
    will address Romandales contention that the appeals suffer from two threshold
    flaws warranting their dismissal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, Romandale submits that Frams appeal is
    improper because it is not an appeal from the dismissal of its 2007 and 2008
    Actions but, rather, an attempt to appeal from the 2014 and 2016 Actions, to
    which Fram was not a party. It says that only a party to a proceeding below can
    appeal and the fact that multiple actions are ordered to be heard together does
    not alter the distinct identities of the parties. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, Romandale submits that the appeals are
    improper because they are founded on a new, never pleaded or asserted
    interpretation of the 2005 August Agreement: that it gave Kerbel an unfettered
    discretion to cause Romandale to trigger the buy-sell before or after SPA.
    Romandale contends that this interpretation contradicts the one that Kerbel
    argued at trial: that the 2005 August Agreement required that it cause
    Romandale to trigger the buy-sell only after SPA. Romandale concludes on this
    alleged flaw by noting that, had the Appellants raised this new theory in their
    pleadings or at trial, the evidence would have no doubt been different.
    Allowing Fram and/or Kerbel to now advance this theory, Romandale says, would
    be manifestly unfair. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For the following reasons, I do not accept that either alleged
    threshold flaw justifies dismissing the appeals.</span></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc67911338"></a><a name="_Toc66970088">A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The First Alleged Threshold Flaw</a></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In my view, the direction that the four actions be tried together
    coupled with the way in which the trial was conducted are a full answer to the
    first alleged flaw. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In his capacity as the case management judge in these proceedings
    and pursuant to r. 6 of the </span><em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em><span
lang=EN-US>, R.R.O. 1990, reg. 194, Dunphy J. exercised his discretion and
    directed that the four actions be tried together in a single trial. He also
    gave directions about matters relating to the conduct of the trial. There can
    be no doubt about the wisdom of these directions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Rule 6 provides that where two or more proceedings are pending in
    the court, an order may be made that they be tried together if it appears to
    the court that the proceedings have a common question of law or fact, the
    relief claimed in them arises out of the same transaction or series of
    transactions, or for any other reason. An order under r. 6 is discretionary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The purpose behind r. 6 is to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings
    and thereby prevent inconsistent dispositions, protect scarce judicial
    resources, and save expense to the parties. It also safeguards against a
    tactical decision to subject a party or parties to more than one action and,
    therefore, promotes fairness: see </span><em>Wood v. Farr Ford Ltd.</em>, 2008
    CanLII 53848 (Ont. S.C.), at para. 23; <em>Mohamed Imran Hanif v. Ontario
    College of Pharmacists, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario and AGO</em>,
    2013 ONSC 6991, 315 O.A.C. 368 (Div. Ct.), at para. 18.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It is readily apparent that the preconditions to the application of
    r. 6 were met. The four actions had common questions of law and fact. And, the
    relief claimed in the actions arose out of one or more of the transactions
    relating to the Lands. As the trial judge noted, at para. 23 of the Reasons,
    the direction that the four actions be tried together was made because the
    actions involve all of the current disputes between these three protagonists
    with respect to their interests in the Lands. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, the direction that the actions be tried together fulfilled
    the purpose which underlies r. 6. A single trial avoided a multiplicity of
    proceedings among the parties, prevented inconsistent dispositions relating to
    the Lands, protected scarce judicial resources, and saved the parties expense.
    In my view, it also does away with Romandales contention that Fram was a party
    only to its actions and not to the proceeding below. The four actions were
    tried together and a single judgment was rendered in respect of those actions.
    The fact that the Judgment sets out the relief granted in respect of each
    action separately does not alter the fact that Fram was a party to the
    proceeding below and, thus, has the right to appeal from the Judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Furthermore, Romandales position on the first alleged threshold
    flaw flies in the face of the way in which these actions proceeded at trial.
    Although the actions were not formally consolidated, the trial of the actions
    was effectively consolidated, with the evidence being used on all issues and
    argument permitted on all issues by all parties. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>At trial, Fram was permitted to lead evidence and make argument on
    the same issues it now raises on appeal. The Reasons show that both Fram and
    Kerbel argued the issues raised in the appeals; the trial judge repeatedly
    refers to Frams position on the issues and she often refers to Frams and
    Kerbels positions interchangeably. Had Romandale wished to take issue with
    Fram making argument and adducing evidence on the issues at trial, it was
    incumbent on Romandale to object at trial, which would have given Fram the
    opportunity to request to be added as a party. Having stayed silent at trial,
    Romandale cannot now take the position that Fram does not have standing on this
    appeal to raise and argue the issues it is pursuing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Finally, I note that Romandale did not question the propriety of
    Frams appeal before the case management judge of this court who issued the
    order consolidating the appeals. It does not now lie in Romandales mouth to
    suggest that Fram is not entitled to pursue its appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For these reasons, Frams appeal is not improper.</span></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc67911339"></a><a name="_Toc66970089">B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Second Alleged Threshold Flaw</a></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Romandales
    second alleged threshold flaw is based on the new interpretation of the 2005
    August Agreement it says that Fram and/or Kerbel advance on appeal. In my
    analysis of Issue #1, below, I explain that because of estoppel by convention,
    Romandale is barred from asserting that the buy-sell provisions in the COAs and
    the 2005 August Agreement could be utilized pre-SPA. The trial judge
    interpreted the 2005 August Agreement on the basis that the buy-sell provision
    could be utilized pre-SPA (Reasons, para. 291). That is, she interpreted it in
    a way that is impermissible because of the operation of estoppel by convention.
    Consequently, her interpretation of the 2005 August Agreement cannot stand and
    it is unnecessary to decide Issue #2. The allegedly new interpretation was made
    in the context of Issue #2. As it is unnecessary to decide Issue #2, it is also
    unnecessary to decide whether the Appellants committed the second threshold
    flaw as Romandale alleges.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
    the second alleged threshold flaw does not warrant the dismissal of these
    appeals. </span></p>

  <p class=Heading>Fram</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Fram contends that, before 2015, Romandale repeatedly made two
    representations: (1) under the COAs, the buy-sell could not be exercised until
    after SPA; and (2) under the 2005 August Agreement, Kerbel could not cause
    Romandale to trigger the buy-sell in the COAs until after SPA (the </span><strong>Representations</strong><span
lang=EN-US>). It says that Romandale made the Representations and statements
    consistent with them in: its pleadings; Ms. Roman-Barbers affidavits; its
    solicitors letters, both before and after the Settlement Agreement; and, Ms.
    Roman-Barbers discovery evidence. Fram submits that the Representations formed
    the basis of a shared common understanding among the parties, and para. 5 was
    incorporated into the Settlement Agreement in reliance on the Representations
    and with Romandales full knowledge. It will be recalled that para. 5 of the
    Settlement Agreement states the parties intention that the purchase and sale of
    the Remaining Interest would take place after SPA. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Fram argues that estoppel by representation and estoppel by
    convention both operate to bar Romandale from reversing its position and
    claiming that para. 5 of the Settlement Agreement is a breach of the 2005
    August Agreement. It contends that the trial judge made a palpable and
    overriding error in refusing to apply estoppel on the basis that Fram and
    Kerbel had not relied on the Representations or, if they did, that their
    reliance was unreasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In terms of reliance, Fram says that the trial judge erred in
    dismissing its and Kerbels evidence that they relied on the Representations on
    the basis the evidence was simply bald assertions. Fram argues there is
    nothing bald about the change in course of action it and Kerbel took in
    entering into the Settlement Agreement. It contends that as a result of the
    Settlement Agreement, it gave up seeking specific performance of its
    contractual remedies and limited its damages claim against Romandale to 50% of the
    Lands, while Kerbel gave up 50% of its rights under the 2005 August Agreement.
    They did so based on the common understanding  perpetuated by Romandale and
    its lawyers  that post-SPA closing was consistent with the COAs and the 2005
    August Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, Fram contends, there was nothing unreasonable about it and
    Kerbels reliance on Romandales Representations. Those Representations were
    made in a litigation context  through pleadings, affidavits, solicitors
    letters, and examination testimony. The very purpose of the Representations was
    to allow the courts and other parties to rely on them for notice and the truth
    of their contents. For example, when Ms. Roman-Barber swore her affidavit in
    2007, she intended the court to rely on it in the injunction proceeding. The
    court did exactly that: Forestell J. accepted Ms. Roman-Barbers evidence that
    the original intent of the [2005 August Agreement] was that the sale to
    [Kerbel] of the remaining interest of Romandale in the Lands would not occur
    until some time after SPA. If the court was entitled to rely on Romandales
    representation of its position Fram argues it was surely reasonable for Fram
    and Kerbel to do the same. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Fram says the trial judge erred in concluding that reliance was
    totally unreasonable in light of Romandales objection to the Settlement
    Agreement, because Romandales objection was not based on the timing of the
    buy-sell. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In terms of detriment, Fram submits that it would be unjust and
    unfair to permit Romandale to resile from the mutual assumptions or
    Representations. In 2010, Kerbel and it entered into the Settlement Agreement
    with the assistance of a judicial mediation and, at that time, all three
    parties agreed that the 2005 August Agreement would close post-SPA. Five years
    later in 2015, knowing the state of the Settlement Agreement, Romandale
    upended the playing field and changed its position to make an uncontroversial
    term in 2010 (i.e. para. 5) an allegedly repudiatory breach of the 2005 August
    Agreement. This, Fram contends, is unfair because it threatens to take away
    Fram and Kerbels entire economic interest in the 2005 August Agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Kerbel</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On these appeals, Kerbel repeats and relies on Frams submissions on
    estoppel. However, because the trial judge did not deal with estoppel by
    convention, it falls to this court to decide that matter </span><em>de novo</em><span
lang=EN-US>. Consequently, I will set out a summary of Kerbels trial position
    on that issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>At trial, Kerbel argued that estoppel by convention applied to bar
    Romandale from contending that, because of para. 5 in the Settlement Agreement,
    Kerbel breached the 2005 August Agreement by entering into the Settlement
    Agreement. It referred to the principles governing estoppel by convention, as
    set out in </span><em>Ryan v. Moore</em><span lang=EN-US>, and argued that
    those principles squarely applied. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Kerbel identified the following as its shared understanding with
    Romandale when they entered into the 2005 August Agreement: because the sale of
    Romandales Remaining Interest would close after SPA, the 2005 August Agreement
    did not breach the COAs between Romandale and Fram (the </span><strong>Shared
    Understanding</strong><span lang=EN-US>). Romandale repeatedly expressed the
    Shared Understanding after the 2005 August Agreement was entered into. This
    includes in the fall of 2010, during which time all three parties  Romandale,
    Fram and Kerbel  participated in the judicial mediation that took place in
    respect of the 2007 and 2008 Actions. Kerbel argued that was evidence that all
    three parties held and operated under the Shared Understanding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Kerbel also pointed to the fact that even after Romandale resiled
    from the Settlement Agreement, it knew that Fram and Kerbel were continuing to
    discuss settlement on the basis of the Shared Understanding. It was only months
    after the Settlement Agreement was executed that Romandale, for the first time,
    took the position that by entering into the Settlement Agreement, Kerbel
    breached the 2005 August Agreement. Kerbel argued that Romandale was obliged to
    warn it, before the Settlement Agreement was executed, that it intended to
    change its position on the Shared Understanding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Kerbel also contended that it would suffer detriment if Romandale
    were allowed to resile from the Shared Assumption. It had already given
    Romandale over $16 million in value under the 2005 August Agreement and,
    through the Settlement Agreement, it compromised its rights under that
    agreement. If Romandale were allowed to resile from the Shared Assumptions,
    Kerbel would lose the opportunity to close its purchase of the Remaining
    Interest under the 2005 August Agreement and develop the Lands.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Romandale</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale says that Frams submissions on estoppel are premised on
    an erroneous oversimplification of the equitable doctrine of convention. It
    contends that, even if there was a shared assumption that the buy-sell could
    not be triggered under the 2005 August Agreement until after SPA, there was no
    transaction or dealing between Romandale and either Fram or Kerbel for which this
    shared assumption formed the basis. In making this argument, Romandale relies
    on para. 4 of </span><em>Ryan v. Moore</em><span lang=EN-US>, in which the
    Supreme Court of Canada states:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Estoppel by convention operates where <span class=Underline>the
    parties</span> have agreed that certain facts <span class=Underline>are deemed
    to be true and to form the basis of the transaction into which they are <b>about</b> to enter</span>. If they have acted upon the agreed assumption, <span
class=Underline>then</span>, <span class=Underline>as regards <b>that
    transaction</b>, each is estopped <b>against the other</b></span> from
    questioning the truth of the statement of facts so assumed if it would be
    unjust to allow one to go back on it. [Citations omitted; emphasis as added by
    Romandale.] </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Thus, Romandale argues, neither Fram nor Kerbel can use estoppel by
    convention against Romandale to protect the Settlement Agreement. Because the Settlement
    Agreement was entered into between Fram and Kerbel only, estoppel by convention
    may apply as between them but not [to] Romandale.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As well, Romandale submits that Frams argument on estoppel starts
    with a misstatement about the nature and character of its position prior to the
    Settlement Agreement. It says that it made no representation upon which Fram or
    Kerbel could rely, nor did the parties have a shared assumption for the
    purposes of estoppel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Its position in the 2007 Action was that the 2005 August Agreement
    was not a breach of the COAs. It says that the timing of the triggering of the
    buy-sell was irrelevant to whether Romandale had breached the COAs. To the
    extent Romandale asserted that the buy-sell in the 2005 August Agreement would
    be triggered after SPA, this was just another way of Romandale asserting that
    the buy-sell under the [2005 August Agreement] could only be triggered when it
    was triggerable under s. 5.07 of the COAs, coupled with the mistake the parties
    and counsel had made about s. 5.07. Given that the mistake was of no
    consequence to the matters in dispute in the 2007 Action, it went unnoticed,
    was not something the parties deliberated on, joined issue on, or turned their
    minds to. It did not form the basis of any of their dealings nor were they all
    of the mind that it would govern their future affairs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale also argues that the trial judge did not err in concluding
    that Fram and Kerbel had not established reliance. It says that the trial judge
    correctly gave no weight to either Mr. Giannones self-serving assertion of
    reliance in his affidavit evidence or to the recital in the Settlement
    Agreement. It contends that the evidence made clear that Fram and Kerbel were
    not relying on Romandale at all but, rather, crafted the Settlement Agreement
    to carry out a scheme in which they would immediately assume control over the
    development of the Lands for their benefit while putting off their purchase of
    the Lands for at least decades.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Furthermore, Romandale says, the trial judge did not err in finding
    that any reliance by Fram and Kebel was unreasonable. Just because a statement
    is made in the course of litigation does not mean it can automatically be
    relied on for the purposes of estoppel. It depends on the circumstances. Fram and
    Kerbel cannot have reasonably relied on Romandales assertions regarding the
    timing of the buy-sell in the 2005 August Agreement because that issue was not
    in dispute in the litigation prior to the Settlement Agreement being entered
    into.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale also points to its objection to the Settlement Agreement,
    arguing that it does not matter whether its objection was based on para. 5 of
    that agreement. Its objection put Fram and Kerbel on notice that it would
    object to any settlement between them. Thus, they proceeded at their own risk.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale also says that, given their position on these appeals,
    Fram and Kerbel could not have reasonably relied on a shared assumption that
    the buy-sell could only be triggered after SPA when entering into the
    Settlement Agreement. Their position on appeal is that Kerbel had an unfettered
    discretion to trigger the buy-sell in the 2005 August Agreement either before
    or after SPA. Thus, Romandale contends, they cannot be heard to say it was
    reasonable for them to rely on a clearly wrong and now abandoned
    interpretation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale also says Fram has not established that it would be unjust
    to allow it to correct its mistake or that Fram and Kerbel suffered any
    detriment. It cannot be unjust for a party to correct a mistake that is patently
    obvious on the express words of the contracts, to which all parties had access.
    Furthermore, Fram and Kerbels entry into the Settlement Agreement was a
    deliberate and inequitable scheme to tie up and control the Lands to
    Romandales exclusion while putting off their purchase for decades.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Moreover, Romandale submits that neither Fram nor Kerbel suffered
    any relevant detriment in entering into the Settlement Agreement. To the extent
    Fram suffered detriment by giving up 50% of its claim against Romandale, that
    detriment is moot because Frams claims in the 2007 and 2008 Actions were
    dismissed and are not being appealed. And, Kerbel presented no evidence of
    detriment. Romandale says that granting Fram an option to buy 50% of the Lands
    is not detriment: Kerbel granted the option in exchange for Fram giving up its
    claims against Kerbel. It was Kerbels choice to assign some litigation risk to
    being sued by Fram and to mitigate that risk by striking a deal with Fram. That
    Fram ultimately lost and Kerbel paid for nothing is irrelevant.</span></p>

    was unreasonable. That is, the trial judge concluded that Fram and Kerbel
    failed to prove the second essential factor giving rise to estoppel by
    representation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

lang=EN-US>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em>Canadian
    Superior Oil Ltd.</em><span lang=EN-US> describes the first essential factor as
    a representation intended to induce a course of conduct on the part of the
    person to whom the representation was made. In </span><em>Ryan v. Moore</em><span
lang=EN-US>, this factor is expressed as the requirement that a positive
    representation be made with the intention that it shall be acted on by the
    party to whom the representation is made. On the facts, Romandale did not make
    a representation with the intention that Fram and Kerbel should act on it.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In the fall of 2010, Fram, Kerbel, and Romandale were attempting to
    settle the 2007 and 2008 Actions. After reaching a settlement agreement in
    principle, the parties continued to negotiate the terms of the settlement.
    During that process, Fram and Kerbel were made aware that Romandale continued to
    maintain its position that the 2005 August Agreement was valid and the buy-sell
    provisions in it and in the COAs could not be utilized until SPA had been
    achieved for the Lands. </span></p>

    remained unchanged from the time that it entered into the 2005 August Agreement

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>At para. 59 of </span><em>Ryan v. Moore</em><span lang=EN-US>, the
    Supreme Court states that the following criteria form the basis of the doctrine
    of estoppel by convention: </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>(1)     The parties dealings
    must have been based on a shared assumption of fact or law: estoppel requires
    manifest representation by statement or conduct creating a mutual assumption.
    Nevertheless, estoppel can arise out of <em>silence</em> (impliedly). [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>(2)     A party must have
    conducted itself, i.e. acted, in reliance on such shared assumption, its
    actions resulting in a change of its legal position.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>(3)     It must also be unjust or
    unfair to allow one of the parties to resile or depart from the common
    assumption. The party seeking to establish estoppel therefore has to prove that
    detriment will be suffered if the other party is allowed to resile from the
    assumption since there has been a change from the presumed position.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On the first criterion  which the Court refers to as Assumption
    Shared and Communicated  the Court provides the following additional
    guidance, at paras. 61-62:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The crucial requirement for estoppel by convention, which
    distinguishes it from the other types of estoppel, is that at the material time
    both parties must be of a like mind. The court must determine what state of
    affairs the parties have accepted, and decide whether there is sufficient
    certainty and clarity in the terms of the convention to give rise to any
    enforceable equity. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>While it may not be necessary that the assumption by the party
    raising estoppel be created or encouraged by the estopped party, it must be
    shared in the sense that each is aware of the assumption of the other. Mutual
    assent is what distinguishes the estoppel by convention from other types of estoppel.
     Thus, it is not enough that each of the two parties acts on an assumption not
    communicated to the other. Further, the estopped party must have, at the very
    least, communicated to the other that he or she is indeed sharing the other
    partys (<em>ex hypothesi</em>) mistaken assumption. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The court also offers further guidance on the second and third
    criteria, namely, reliance and detriment. It notes that the requirement of
    detrimental reliance lies at the heart of true estoppel and that detrimental
    reliance encompasses two distinct, but interrelated concepts: reliance and
    detriment: at paras. 68-69. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Reliance requires a finding that the party seeking to establish the
    estoppel changed its course of conduct by acting, or abstaining from acting, in
    reliance upon the assumption, thereby altering its legal position: at para. 69. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In terms of detriment, the Court offers this guidance, at para. 73
    of </span><em>Ryan v. Moore</em><span lang=EN-US>. Once the party seeking to
    establish estoppel shows that it acted on a shared assumption, it must prove
    detriment. For the plea to succeed, it must be unjust or unfair to allow a
    party to resile from the common assumption. A change from the presumed legal
    position will facilitate the establishment of detriment because there is an
    element of injustice inherent within the concept of the shared assumption  one
    party has acted unjustly in allowing the belief or expectation to cross the
    line and arise in the others mind: at para. 73, citing Sean Wilken, </span><em>Wilken
    and Villiers: The Law of Waiver, Variation and Estoppel</em><span lang=EN-US>,

lang=EN-US>It is worth recalling at this point that I did not find statements
    to the same effect as the Shared Assumptions to amount to representations
    within the meaning of estoppel by representation. That is because a common or
    shared assumption, as that term is used in estoppel by convention, is not the
    same thing as a representation. As the Supreme Court explained, at para. 62 of </span><em>Ryan
    v. Moore</em><span lang=EN-US>, an assumption need not be created or encouraged
    by the estopped party: it must simply be shared, in the sense that each party
    is aware that the assumption is held by the other(s). As the Supreme Court
    stated, Mutual assent is what distinguishes the estoppel by convention from
    other types of estoppel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Having found the Shared Assumptions were sufficiently certain and
    clear, I must now determine whether the parties were of a like mind. In
    making this determination, I must consider whether the three parties: (1) held
    the Shared Assumptions at the material times; (2) communicated to the others
    that they held the Shared Assumptions; and (3) based their dealings on them: </span><em>Ryan
    v. Moore</em>, <span lang=EN-US>at paras. 61-62. In my view, the following
    documents establish these three matters. Thus, the first criterion for estoppel

lang=EN-US>In response, by letter dated September 30, 2010, counsel for
    Romandale provided comments on the draft and asked that the final settlement
    agreement include, among other things, a provision explicitly requiring the
    parties to do nothing to hinder or delay the obtaining of SPA for the Lands. He
    wrote, As we were specifically advised at the mediation that this would not be
    a problem, the wording should be inserted in the Minutes. As well, counsel for
    Romandale asked that a drop-dead date for the contemplated sale of the Lands
    be inserted in case the Lands never achieved SPA:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>At present, there exists the possibility that one or both
    parcels may not receive [SPA]. Such a failure to address that point may call
    into question the validity of the agreements or at least pose a practical
    problem for the parties if [SPA] is not achieved (at least in our lifetimes)
    for either of the parcels.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The parties continued to communicate about the draft settlement
    agreement for some weeks. In October 2010, Romandale began taking issue with the
    draft agreements, which I discuss in more detail below. Ultimately, in a letter
    dated November 12, 2010, Frams counsel wrote to Romandales counsel (with a
    copy to Kerbels counsel), stating that it appeared Romandale was resiling from
    the settlement agreement so steps would be taken to reschedule the trial of the
    2007 and 2008 Actions. Frams counsel enclosed a copy of the draft settlement
    agreement that Fram and Kerbel intended to enter into. The enclosed agreement
    was substantially the same as the final Settlement Agreement, including the
    provisions that reflected the Shared Assumptions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Never once during the judicial mediation or in the period that
    followed leading up to the Settlement Agreement  despite the many
    communications among counsel which reflected the Shared Assumptions  did
    Romandale ever object to the Shared Assumptions or the terms in the drafts that
    reflected them. On the contrary, during that period, Romandale expressly
    affirmed the parties shared understanding that the sale and purchase of
    Romandales Remaining Interest would occur after SPA  as, for example, in its
    counsels letters of September 24 and September 30, 2010, described above. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

lang=EN-US>In a letter dated September 22, 2009, Romandales corporate counsel
    wrote to Kerbels counsel to address the matter of participation in the NMLG.
    He stated that, under the 2005 August Agreement, Kerbel was to act as
    Romandales agent and attorney for the purposes of taking the steps necessary
    to proceed to [SPA] and thereby trigger the buy-sell rights under the [COAs].
    This is communication by Romandale to Kerbel of its belief in the Shared
    Assumptions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale also communicated its belief in the Shared Assumptions to
    Fram. By letter dated January 28, 2011, counsel for Romandale wrote to counsel
    for Fram stating: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Romandale] was and is the registered owner of 90% of the
    [Lands]. It conditionally sold those lands to [Kerbel] by way of an agreement
    dated August 2005. The condition could only be satisfied by either a) secondary
    plan approval (which has not been achieved); b) or the consent of [Fram] to the
    transaction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>This letter was sent more than a month after Fram and Kerbel entered

lang=EN-US>The pleadings and evidence at trial further demonstrate that all

lang=EN-US>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>At trial, Fram and Kerbels positions rested on the Shared
    Assumptions. Their pleadings  including Frams Fresh as Amended Reply and
    Kerbels Statement of Defence and Crossclaim in the 2007 Action  reflect their
    shared belief that SPA was required before the buy-sell provision in the COAs
    and the 2005 August Agreement could be triggered. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandales Statement of Defence in the 2007 Action (before it was
    amended in 2015), its Statement of Defence in the 2008 Action, and its Notice
    of Motion to stay the 2007 Action all explicitly stated that the buy-sell

    on SPA being obtained for the Lands. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[173]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Having established that the first criterion for estoppel by
    convention is met, I must now determine whether Fram and Kerbel acted in
    reliance on the Shared Assumptions. For the purpose of estoppel by convention,
    reliance requires a finding that the party seeking to establish estoppel
    changed its course of conduct by acting (or abstaining from acting) in reliance
    on the shared assumption, thereby altering its legal position: </span><em>Ryan
    v. Moore</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 69.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In my view, Fram and Kerbel satisfy the reliance criterion. Paragraph
    5 of the Settlement Agreement is based on the Shared Assumptions. Fram and
    Kerbel entered into the Settlement Agreement in reliance on the Shared
    Assumptions. As a result of having entered into the Settlement Agreement, their
    respective legal positions under the COAs and the 2005 August Agreement were
    altered. An overview of the alteration to their legal positions that resulted
    from having entered into the Settlement Agreement is as follows.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Before entering into the Settlement Agreement, Frams legal position
    in respect of the Lands was governed by the COAs between it and Romandale. In
    the 2007 Action, it claimed that Romandale had breached the prohibition against
    Disposition in the COAs by entering into the 2005 August Agreement. If Fram
    succeeded in its claim, Fram was entitled to, among other things: a declaration
    that the offending agreement (i.e., the 2005 August Agreement) was void under
    s. 5.03 of the COAs; bring proceedings for specific performance under s.
    6.02(b) of the COAs; and purchase Romandales interest in the Lands at 95% of
    their fair market value under s. 6.02(d) of the COAs. As a result of entering
    into the Settlement Agreement, Fram gave up those rights: pursuant to s. 1 of
    the Settlement Agreement, Fram agreed that it would not seek a declaration that
    the 2005 August Agreement was void and that it would limit its damages claims
    against Romandale to 50% of the Lands.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[176]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Before entering into the Settlement Agreement, Kerbels legal
    position in respect of the Lands was governed by the 2005 August Agreement
    between it and Romandale. The Conditional Provision in that agreement gave
    Kerbel the opportunity to acquire 100% ownership of the Lands. After entering
    into the Settlement Agreement, that changed. Pursuant to para. 2 of the
    Settlement Agreement, if Kerbel acquired ownership of the Lands, Kerbel was
    obliged  at Frams option  to allow Fram to acquire a 50% undivided interest
    in the Lands on the same terms and conditions as Kerbel had acquired the
    Remaining Interest from Romandale. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Thus, it can be seen, Fram and Kerbels legal positions were altered
    as a result of relying on the Shared Assumptions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I do not view my determination that Fram and Kerbel meet the
    reliance criterion for estoppel by convention as running afoul of the trial
    judges determination of no reliance on the part of Fram and Kerbel or, if
    there was reliance, it was unreasonable. That is because the trial judge made
    her reliance determination based on the legal principles governing estoppel by
    representation whereas I decided reliance in accordance with the legal
    principles governing estoppel by convention. The two legal frameworks are
    different, the test for reliance in each is different, and, therefore, the
    determination of reliance under each may be different without being inconsistent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>However, if, as Romandale urges, the trial judges determination on
    reliance is a finding of fact for which deference must be shown, I would set it
    aside on the basis that it is the result of palpable and overriding error.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On the evidence set out above, it is clear that Fram and Kerbel
    relied on the Shared Assumptions in entering into the Settlement Agreement. A
    plain reading of the Settlement Agreement alone shows that. A contrary finding
     namely, that Fram and Kerbel did not rely on the Shared Assumptions in
    entering into the Settlement Agreement  is simply not available on the
    evidence. Thus, such a finding would be the result of palpable and overriding
    error.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge also made a palpable and overriding error in
    determining that, if there was reliance, it was unreasonable. In making this
    determination, the trial judge accepted that Romandale put Fram and Kerbel on
    notice that it objected to any settlement agreement between them in respect of
    the Lands without its consent: Reasons, at para. 129. Romandale says that it
    objected clearly and unequivocally to the Settlement Agreement including
    Fram and Kerbel deferring the closing of the 2005 August Agreement by decades
    rather than carrying it out immediately in 2010, as Romandale expressly asked
    them to do. In support of this argument, it relies on its letter to Fram,
    dated October 25, 2010.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I do not agree. The relevant portions of Romandales letter of
    October 25, 2010, are as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>More importantly, your correspondence only confirms our
    clients belief that the relationship contemplated by the proposed Minutes of
    Settlement cannot work<span class=Underline>. Simply put, the benefit of the
    August 2005 Agreement cannot be assigned in whole or in part to your client
    without our clients consent</span>. In order to give that consent, not only
    would real estate counsel have to draft extensive documentation, but <span
class=Underline>there remain at present simply some points to which our client
    cannot agree, in particular, the registration of the injunction against title
    to the lands for which Romandale continues to hold legal title; and arbitration
    over a process which Romandale has effectively controlled without objection
    from any party for 5 years now</span>. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>To avoid these problems, your client,
    together with Mr. Kerbel, can formulate an offer to purchase our clients
    interest in the lands immediately</span>. Failing that, we should appear before
    Justice Moore and request a trial date to adjudicate all issues. <span
class=Underline>If you and [counsel for Kerbel] believe that a settlement of the
    August 2005 Agreement can be effected without the consent of the 90% land
    holder, then that issue will likely also form the subject matter of the trial</span>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Nothing in this letter suggests that Romandale objected to the
    Settlement Agreement because of para. 5. That is, there is nothing in the
    letter to indicate that Romandale objected to the expressed intention in para.
    5 that the purchase and sale of the Remaining Interest was to take place after
    SPA. Instead, the letter shows that Romandale resiled from the Settlement
    Agreement over matters such as registration of the injunction on title to the
    Lands and arbitration. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, Romandales call to Fram and Kerbel to formulate an offer
    to purchase [Romandales] interest in the lands immediately does not indicate
    that Romandale believed the buy-sell provisions in the COAs and the 2005 August
    Agreement could be triggered at any time, pre or post-SPA. The parties all knew
    Fram could consent to the sale of Romandales Remaining Interest before SPA
    and, with that consent, the purchase and sale of Romandales Remaining Interest
    could proceed immediately. Romandales call to Fram and Kerbel to make an
    immediate purchase is merely a request that the parties proceed with the sale
    under Frams consent. It says nothing about Romandales assumptions regarding
    the buy-sell provisions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Until 2015, Romandale never retracted its communications on the
    Shared Assumptions and never purported to. In fact, as I describe above,
    Romandale confirmed in writing its belief in the Shared Assumptions in a letter
    in January 2011  </span>after <span lang=EN-US>Fram and Kerbel executed the
    Settlement Agreement  when it again made manifest that the sale of its
    Remaining Interest under the 2005 August Agreement could not take place until
    after SPA or with Frams consent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[186]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As Romandale did not communicate to Fram and Kerbel that it no
    longer held the Shared Assumptions until 2015, in the circumstances of this
    case, it was not unreasonable for Fram and Kerbel to rely on the Shared
    Assumptions when they entered into the Settlement Agreement in 2010. As Fram
    points out, the court relied on Romandales assertions to the same effect in
    the injunction proceeding. In light of that, it can scarcely be said to be
    unreasonable that Fram and Kerbel also relied on them.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><a name="_Toc66970103">(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detriment</a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[187]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The third criterion for establishing estoppel by convention is
    detriment. As the parties seeking to establish estoppel by convention, Fram and
    Kerbel must prove that if Romandale were allowed to resile from the Shared
    Assumptions, they would suffer detriment since there had been a change from
    their presumed legal positions: </span><em>Ryan v. Moore</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    at paras. 59, 69. To succeed in proving detriment, Fram and Kerbel must show
    that it would be unjust or unfair to allow Romandale to resile from the Shared
    Assumptions: </span><em>Ryan v. Moore</em><span lang=EN-US>, at paras. 59, 73
    and 74. A change from their presumed legal positions will facilitate the
    establishment of detriment: </span><em>Ryan v. Moore</em><span lang=EN-US>,</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US>at para. 73. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[188]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As I have explained, Fram and Kerbel entered into the Settlement
    Agreement in reliance on the Shared Assumptions and thereby altered their legal
    positions under the COAs and the 2005 August Agreement respectively. While the
    change in their legal positions facilitates the establishment of detriment, it
    remains their burden to show that it would be unjust or unfair to allow
    Romandale to resile from the Shared Assumptions: </span><em>Ryan v. Moore</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 74. One need only consider what transpired at the trial
    below and the resulting Judgment to find they satisfy that burden.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Paragraph 5 of the Settlement Agreement reflects the parties Shared
    Assumptions that the purchase and sale of Romandales Remaining Interest would
    take place after SPA had been obtained. The trial judge accepted Romandales
    submission that para. 5 was a breach of the 2005 August Agreement on Kerbels
    part. In so doing, the trial judge permitted Romandale to resile from the
    Shared Assumptions. Having determined that Kerbel was in breach, the trial judge
    declared the 2005 August Agreement at an end and excused Romandale from
    performance of its obligations under that agreement. Thus, it can be seen, if
    Romandale had not been permitted to resile from the Shared Assumptions, Kerbel
    would not have been found to have been in breach of the 2005 August Agreement
    and it would not have lost the right to compel Romandale to fulfill its
    obligations under that agreement. In the circumstances of this case, it was
    unjust and unfair to Kerbel that Romandale was permitted to resile from the
    Shared Assumptions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[190]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It was also unfair and unjust to Fram. In accordance with the
    Settlement Agreement, Fram discontinued its claims against Kerbel in the 2007
    and 2008 Actions and gave up significant claims against Romandale under the
    COAs. However, the </span><em>quid pro quo</em> <span lang=EN-US>under the
    Settlement Agreement was that Fram would have the opportunity to acquire 50%
    ownership of the Lands once Kerbel bought Romandales Remaining Interest.
    Because Romandale was permitted to resile from the Shared Assumptions and was
    consequently excused from performance under the 2005 August Agreement,
    Romandale was no longer obliged to sell its Remaining Interest to Kerbel. Thus,
    Fram gave up its claims for nothing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[191]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Accordingly, in my view, it would be unjust and unfair to allow
    Romandale to resile from the Shared Assumptions. In reaching this conclusion, I
    reject Romandales submission to the contrary. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[192]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale makes two arguments in support of its submission that it
    would be neither unjust nor unfair to allow it to resile. First, it argues that
    it cannot be unjust or unfair that it be allowed to correct the mistaken Shared
    Assumptions because the mistake as to the timing of the buy-sell provisions was
    patently obvious on the express words of the contracts to which all parties
    had access. Second, it argues that Fram and Kerbels entry into the Settlement
    Agreement was a deliberate and inequitable scheme to tie up and control the
    Lands (to Romandales exclusion) while putting off their purchase for at least
    decades. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[193]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Respectfully, Romandales first argument misunderstands the
    detriment criterion in the doctrine of estoppel by convention. Detriment is not
    about the correctness of the Shared Assumptions or how obviously incorrect they
    might have been. Detriment is a question of whether it would be unjust or
    unfair to allow Romandale to resile from the Shared Assumptions  regardless of
    whether the Shared Assumptions were correct or were patently incorrect. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[194]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandales second argument is that if it was not permitted to
    resile, Fram and Kerbel would get away with their deliberate and inequitable
    scheme to tie up the Lands for decades without having to pay for them. This
    argument does not withstand scrutiny. Before trial, Fram gave its consent to
    Kerbels purchase of Romandales Remaining Interest. Accordingly, had Romandale
    wished, it could have completed the sale of its Remaining Interest to Kerbel
    right then. In short, by the time of trial, there was no threat that, as a
    result of the Settlement Agreement, the Lands would be tied up for decades
    without Romandale being paid for its Remaining Interest in them.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[195]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>At all material times during its dealings with Fram and Kerbel,
    Romandale manifestly represented to Fram and Kerbel that it held the Shared
    Assumptions. Fram and Kerbel then relied on the Shared Assumptions and entered
    into the Settlement Agreement. As a result of that, Fram and Kerbels legal
    positions were altered. In the circumstances, it would be unjust and unfair to
    permit Romandale to resile from the Shared Assumptions. Consequently, Fram and
    Kerbel have met their burden on the detriment criterion. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[203]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>An appeal and cross-appeal were taken to the Newfoundland Court of
    Appeal. A majority of the Court of Appeal held that estoppel by convention
    barred the insurer and Mr. Moores estate from pleading that Mr. Moore died in
    1998 or that Letters of Administration were granted in February 1999. Thus,
    they could not invoke the shorter limitation period in the </span><em>Survival

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[204]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The insurer and Mr. Moores estate appealed to the Supreme Court.
    The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and struck the Plaintiffs statement of
    claim because it had been brought outside the six-month period prescribed by
    the </span><em>Survival of Actions Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[205]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The Supreme Court held that the doctrine of estoppel by convention
    had not been made out. It found that none of the letters exchanged by the
    Plaintiff and the insurer with respect to the Plaintiffs personal injury claim
    proved the existence of a common assumption. The mere fact that communications
    occurred between the parties did not establish that they assumed that Mr. Moore
    was alive. And, the fact the parties were conferring without regard to the
    limitation period did not establish a shared assumption that the limitation
    period defence would not be relied on. There was never any discussion by the
    Plaintiff of the limitation period. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[206]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Thus, while the Supreme Court in </span><em>Ryan v. Moore</em><span
lang=EN-US> refers to the Plaintiff, the insurer, and Mr. Moores estate as
    parties, they were not parties to a contract. Despite that, the Supreme Court
    considered whether the doctrine of estoppel by convention operated. In fact,
    estoppel by convention was the central legal point on which the appeal hinged.
    Further, when the Supreme Court concluded that the doctrine was inapplicable,
    it made no mention of the absence of a contract among the parties. Rather, the
    Court found the doctrine to be inapplicable because the correspondence among
    the parties did not prove the existence of a shared assumption among the
    parties. It found that such things as the subject line in the correspondence,
    which read Your Insured: Rex Moore, lacked sufficient clarity and certainty
    to demonstrate a common belief that he was alive. It further found that even if
    one could conclude that there was a common assumption, the Plaintiff had never
    communicated that he shared it.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[207]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the applicability of the doctrine of estoppel by
    convention does not depend on the parties having entered into a contract with
    one another. Rather, as the Supreme Court states in para. 59 of </span><em>Ryan
    v. Moore</em>, <span lang=EN-US>the question is whether the parties dealings
    were based on a shared assumption of fact or law. In this case, while Romandale
    was not a party to the Settlement Agreement, it was actively involved in the
    negotiations leading up to that agreement. As I explain above, during that
    period, the parties correspondence (among other things) clearly demonstrate
    that their dealings were based on the Shared Assumptions. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>In the judicial mediation in September 2010, Fram, Kerbel, and
    Romandale communicated to one another their common belief in the Shared
    Assumptions. They reached a settlement agreement in principle which reflected
    those assumptions. The Shared Assumptions were manifest in the preliminary
    draft settlement agreement and all the drafts that followed through to the
    final Settlement Agreement. Romandale participated in ongoing negotiations of
    the Settlement Agreement and received copies of all the drafts, even after it
    resiled from that agreement. Never once during that process did Romandale
    dispute the validity of the Shared Assumptions. Rather, at several points it
    expressly reiterated the Shared Assumptions in communications it sent to Fram
    and Kerbel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[209]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>When Fram and Kerbel entered into the Settlement Agreement, they
    relied on their unqualified understanding that all three parties and their
    counsel held the Shared Assumptions. As a result of having entered into the
    Settlement Agreement, their legal positions were altered. Allowing Romandale to
    resile from the Shared Assumptions years after the Settlement Agreement was
    concluded would cause detriment to both Fram and Kerbel. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[211]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>After Romandale terminated the DMAs with Bordeaux in early 2005,
    Bordeaux responded with an action against Romandale and Fram, alleging the
    termination was invalid and of no force and effect. The litigation was ongoing
    in August 2005 when Romandale and Kerbel entered into the 2005 August
    Agreement. The trial judge interpreted the 2005 August Agreement as permitting
    Kerbel to delay triggering the buy-sell provisions until after SPA </span>only
    if the Bordeaux litigation dragged on<span lang=EN-US> (emphasis added) (the </span><strong>Interpretation</strong><span
lang=EN-US>). Based on the Interpretation, the trial judge concluded that
    Kerbel repudiated the 2005 August Agreement by entering into the Settlement
    Agreement because, as a result of para. 5 of the Settlement Agreement, the
    purchase and sale of the Remaining Interest could not take place until after
    SPA. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[212]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Fram argues that the trial judges Interpretation is erroneous. It
    contends that she made four extricable errors of law in reaching the
    Interpretation: (1) failure to give the text of the 2005 August Agreement
    primacy; (2) accepting impermissible subjective evidence as factual matrix
    evidence; (3) misinterpreting the time is of the essence clause in the 2005
    August Agreement; and (4) failing to look at commercial reasonableness at the
    time of contract execution and from the viewpoint of both parties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[213]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In light of my conclusion on the doctrine of estoppel by convention,
    Romandale is barred from asserting that the buy-sell provisions in either the
    COAs or the 2005 August Agreement could be exercised before SPA. Because the
    trial judges Interpretation permits for the buy-sell provision in the 2005
    August Agreement to be exercised before SPA, the Interpretation is contrary to
    the Shared Assumptions and cannot stand. Consequently, I need not address the
    errors in contractual interpretation that Fram contends the trial judge made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[214]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>While I need not address the alleged errors in contractual

lang=EN-US>In addition to finding that Kerbel breached the 2005 August
    Agreement by entering into the Settlement Agreement with Fram, the trial judge
    also found that, by entering into the Settlement Agreement, Kerbel failed to
    act in good faith, breached the fiduciary duty she found Kerbel owed Romandale,
    breached the time is of the essence clause in the 2005 August Agreement, and
    repudiated the 2005 August Agreement. As I have explained, estoppel by
    convention operates to bar Romandale from attacking the validity of para. 5 of
    the Settlement Agreement. As para. 5 of the Settlement Agreement was the basis
    on which the trial judge concluded that Kerbel repudiated the 2005 August
    Agreement, that conclusion must fall. Accordingly, it is not necessary to
    address the issues (and related sub-issues) that Kerbel raises respecting the

lang=EN-US>Kerbels overarching position on appeal rests on this foundational
    legal proposition: the general rule is that it is not the function of the court
    to rewrite a contract for the parties nor is it the courts role to relieve one
    of the parties against the consequences of an improvident contract: </span><em>Pacific
    National Investments Ltd. v. Victoria (City of)</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2004 SCC
    75, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 575, at para. 31. Kerbel says that the trial judge violated
    this general rule and, after determining that enforcement of the 2005 August
    Agreement was not in Romandales interests, allowed that conclusion to drive
    her reasoning. However, Kerbel says, the question for the trial judge was not
    whether the 2005 August Agreement turned out to be a good deal for Romandale
    but, rather, whether the defences Romandale asserted to the enforcement of the
    2005 August Agreement were tenable in law and fact.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[218]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In terms of frustration specifically, Kerbel submits that the trial
    judge erred when she concluded, at para. 349 of the Reasons, that the 2005
    August Agreement was frustrated because unforeseen planning changes resulted
    in SPA not only being delayed for decades but also putting the two farms on
    different development tracks. Kerbel says that the doctrine of frustration
    does not apply for two reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[219]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>First, it notes that frustration applies when a supervening event
    alters the nature of the parties obligations to such an extent that to compel
    performance would require a party to do something radically different than
    what they had agreed to under their contract. It says that the change in the
    development timeline for the Lands did not fundamentally alter what the parties
    contracted for under the 2005 August Agreement. The parties had agreed that
    Romandale would sell and Kerbel would buy its Remaining Interest in the Lands.
    The thing the parties bargained for has not changed  only the timing of the
    closing of the transaction has. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[220]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, Kerbel says that a contract is not frustrated if the
    supervening event was contemplated by the parties at the time of contracting
    and was provided for, or deliberately chosen not to be provided for, in the
    contract. It argues that to the parties knowledge, the planning and
    development process is fluid, unpredictable, and outside the parties control.
    There was never any certainty as to the development timeline for the Lands and
    the fact that governmental decisions altered the timetable was within the
    parties contemplation. They point to this courts decision in the Triple R
    Lands Litigation, in which that precise point is made: </span><em>First Elgin
    Mills Developments Inc. v. Romandale Farms Limited</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2014

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[221]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, Kerbel argues, contrary to the trial judges finding, the
    parties agreement to a fixed purchase price in this context does not lead to a
    commercial absurdity. The parties deliberately chose to enter into an
    agreement for a fixed purchase price of the Remaining Interest that was
    significantly above market value. In doing so, Romandale assumed the risk of
    what a delay in closing would entail.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>Romandale submits that Kerbel has not demonstrated any palpable and
    overriding errors in the trial judges finding that the 2005 August Agreement
    was frustrated when unforeseen planning changes delayed SPA for decades and put
    the Lands on different development tracks. It makes two key arguments in
    support of this submission.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[224]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>First, it says that Kerbel is wrong that the change in the
    development timeline did not fundamentally change the nature of the contract
    because it simply delayed closing. The trial judge found that a short closing
    horizon was part of the pith and substance of the contract and, in any event,
    that SPA was at most years away, not decades. A delay of decades is radically
    different than what the parties agreed to. Further, Romandale says Kerbel
    failed to address the trial judges finding on frustration based on the farms
    being placed on different development tracks.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[225]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As well, Romandale says Kerbel is wrong that legislative changes
    cannot frustrate a contract. </span><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Relying

    D.L.R. (3d) 387 (Ont. C.A.), it says that changes in law or policy will
    frustrate a contract and relieve the parties of performance where the common
    venture is frustrated. The trial judge found that the parties common
    venture of providing for the most expedient sale of the Lands, without
    breaching the COAs, was no longer attainable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[226]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale says that proof of a delayed timeline for development and
    separate development tracks for the farms resulted in radically different
    circumstances than those contemplated in the 2005 August Agreement. It argues
    this is apparent from the terms of the that agreement: it was silent on how to
    close if the Lands achieved SPA at different times; the farms were treated as a
    single property; there were no terms on how to treat the farms individually;
    and, it made no commercial sense when closing was decades in the future. This,
    Romandale argues, would result in an irreconcilable divergence of interests when
    the express terms of the 2005 August Agreement provide it is conditional for
    the benefit of both parties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[227]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, Romandale says that Kerbel is wrong that the parties
    contemplated the planning changes when entering into the 2005 August Agreement
    or deliberately did not provide for such changes. It argues that Kerbels
    reference to this courts 2014 decision regarding the Triple R Lands is
    misleading. Even if the parties were aware that the process of developing the
    Lands was fluid, unpredictable, and would take time, this does not mean they
    contemplated SPA being deferred for decades and that the Lands would be put on
    separate development tracks.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[228]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale contends that the trial judges factual findings are
    important  that when the 2005 August Agreement was made, the parties expected
    the Lands would achieve SPA by 2010 or soon thereafter and not decades later or
    with the farms on separate development tracks. It says these are radical
    changes in the planning law and process and Kerbel has not challenged them.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The trial judge concluded that the 2005 August Agreement was
    frustrated because unforeseen planning changes resulted in SPA being delayed by
    decades and put the Snider and McGrisken Farms on different development tracks.
    She said these matters rendered performance of the Conditional Provision
    radically different from that which the parties agreed to: at para. 349. In
    my view, the trial judge erred in law in so concluding: the planning changes do
    not amount to a supervening event, as that term is used in the doctrine of
    frustration. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>As previously noted, at para. 55 of </span><em>Naylor Group</em><span
lang=EN-US>, the Supreme Court stated that a contract is frustrated when 
    without the fault of either party  a supervening event alters the nature of a
    partys obligations under the contract to such an extent that to compel
    performance would be to order the party to do something radically different
    from that to which it had agreed under the contract. Neither the change to the
    timing of the development of the Lands nor the fact that the development paths
    of the two farms now diverge render Romandales obligations under the 2005
    August Agreement radically different from that to which it agreed. Therefore,
    the planning changes are not a supervening event and the agreement is not
    frustrated. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[234]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>This conclusion follows inescapably from a consideration of the 2005
    August Agreement as a whole, including the Conditional Provision. When
    Romandale and Kerbel entered into the 2005 August Agreement, all of their
    obligations under it were to be performed in short order with one exception:
    their obligations under the Conditional Provision. Those obligations were
    clearly spelled out: Romandale was to sell its Remaining Interest in the Lands
    to Kerbel at a price of $160,000 per acre: (1) with Frams consent to the
    transaction or (2) through Romandales exercise of the buy-sell provision in
    the COAs, after the Lands achieved SPA. The parties specified the two methods
    by which the transaction could be completed  rather than simply setting a date
    for its completion  because they wanted to ensure that the 2005 August
    Agreement did not run afoul of Romandales pre-existing legal obligations to
    Fram under the COAs.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[235]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>While the planning changes altered the timing horizon for the
    development of the Lands and the development paths of the Snider and McGrisken
    Farms, those changes did not radically alter what the parties had agreed to
    under the 2005 August Agreement. In fact, the planning changes did not alter
    the parties obligations under the Conditional Provision in any way. What
    changed were the parties expectations about when SPA would be obtained for the
    Lands. Romandale remained obliged to sell its Remaining Interest to Kerbel,
    either by obtaining Frams consent to the transaction or by using the buy-sell
    provisions in the COAs, once SPA for the Lands was achieved. And Kerbel
    remained obliged to pay Romandale $160,000 per acre for the Remaining Interest.
    The fact that the expected timing for SPA changed did not alter those
    obligations  and nothing in the 2005 August Agreement suggests otherwise. For
    example, there is no drop-dead date provision in the agreement. With due
    respect to the trial judge, the boiler-plate statement at para. 7(c) of the
    2005 August Agreement that time is of the essence cannot be construed to mean
    that a short closing horizon was part of the pith and substance of the
    contract. Further and in any event, if Romandale was troubled by the prospect
    of a lengthy delay in closing based on SPA, it could have sought Frams consent
    to the transaction. On the record, Romandale took no steps in that regard,
    despite having expressly undertaken in the Conditional Provision to use
    reasonable best efforts to obtain Frams consent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[236]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Because the parties obligations under the Conditional Provision are
    not altered by the planning changes, it cannot be said that compelling performance
    of the 2005 August Agreement would be to order Romandale to do something
    radically different from that to which it agreed. In short, in the
    circumstances of this case, the planning changes do not amount to a supervening
    event.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[237]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, even if the planning changes were to amount to a
    supervening event, the 2005 August Agreement is not frustrated because the
    supervening event was within Romandale and Kerbels contemplation when they
    entered into the agreement and they did not provide for it: </span>Perkins<span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 16. Of this there can be no doubt, given this courts
    findings in </span><em>First Elgin Mills</em><span lang=EN-US>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[238]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It will be recalled that </span><em>First Elgin Mills</em><span
lang=EN-US> dealt with the transaction in the 2005 August Agreement in which
    Kerbel purchased the Triple R Lands from Romandale (acting on behalf of the
    Roman family). The purchase price for the Triple R Lands was calculated on the
    basis that the land was all developable. However, the land was not all
    developable so Kerbel sought an adjustment to the purchase price in accordance with
    the terms of the 2005 August Agreement. Romandale resisted, saying that the
    purchase price adjustment clause had expired. The matter was litigated. This
    court ultimately found in favour of Kerbel. At paras. 31-32 of </span><em>First
    Elgin Mills</em><span lang=EN-US>, Lauwers J.A. writing for the court, stated: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The process of moving raw land through the land development
    process, is complex, time consuming, and expensive. The outcome is frequently
    uncertain. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The parties to this litigation are sophisticated and
    experienced land developers and were legally represented throughout the
    proceedings. The principals affidavits show that, when they entered into the
    [2005 August Agreement], they were aware that the process of developing the
    [Lands] would be fluid and the outcome somewhat unpredictable, and that it
    would take time  perhaps years  to finalize the [Lands] development
    potential. There were provincial, regional, and local requirements to be met,
    any of which could affect the [Lands] development potential ... </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[239]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Thus, it can be seen, this court found that Romandale and Kerbel
    were aware of the vagaries of the planning process when they entered into the
    2005 August Agreement. That is, the possibility of planning changes was within
    the parties contemplation when they entered into the 2005 August Agreement.
    Despite that, they made no provision for such a possibility  as, for example,
    through the insertion of a drop-dead provision. Therefore, even if the
    planning changes were a supervening event, the 2005 August Agreement is not
    frustrated. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[240]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I conclude on this issue by noting that, while Romandale is correct
    that legislative changes can frustrate a contract, this applies when the
    legislation destroys the very foundation of the agreement: </span><em>Capital
    Quality Homes</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 29. As I have explained, that is
    not this case. </span></p>

    to the parties initial time estimates does not somehow elevate those estimates
    into a common mistake such as to vitiate their consent to the deal in the 2005

    essentially the same as what the parties believed it to be when they entered into

    unjustness and unfairness above, in my discussion of estoppel by convention. I
    will not repeat myself. The considerations set out in that analysis show why,
    even if Kerbel could be seen to have obtained a legal advantage because of the
    changes in the planning process, it is not unconscientious to enforce the

lang=EN-US>I conclude on the equitable doctrine of common mistake by observing
    that the court is to take into consideration all of the circumstances when
    deciding whether it would be unconscientious to enforce the contract. The
    circumstances at the time of trial included the fact that Fram had provided its
    consent to the transaction in the Conditional Provision. Consequently, the
    transaction could have closed immediately. The trial judge did not take that
    into consideration. This is evident from her conclusion that enforcing the 2005
    August Agreement would be unconscionable because the transaction had been put
    off for decades. In the face of Frams consent, the transaction could have
    closed immediately. Thus, it was a palpable and overriding error to find that
    the transaction had been put off for decades. Moreover, in my view, the trial
    judge erred in law in failing to take into account the relevant consideration
    of Frams consent when determining whether it would be unconscionable to
    enforce the 2005 August Agreement. For these reasons, Romandale failed to make
    out the requirements for common mistake in equity and the trial judge erred in

lang=EN-US>[253]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>First, until 2015, Romandale alleged that the 2005 August Agreement
    was terminated by Kerbels breach in reducing the net developable acreage of
    the Lands; it sought damages in the alternative. It was only in 2015 that
    Romandale claimed it would not comply with the 2005 August Agreement in any
    event, and Kerbel started the 2016 Action shortly thereafter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[254]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, the trial judges finding that Kerbel discovered its claim
    in 2011 ignores Master Grahams ruling on December 21, 2012.</span><a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;
color:black'>[12]</span></span></span></a><span lang=EN-US> In that ruling,
    Master Graham dismissed Romandales motion for leave to amend its pleadings to
    allege that Kerbel had breached the 2005 August Agreement by entering into the
    Settlement Agreement. Kerbel says it was entitled to rely on the ruling and
    that the trial judges reasoning leads to an anomalous and unreasonable result.
    In order to bring its action in time, Kerbel would have had to commence an
    action by 2013 for a declaration that the Settlement Agreement did not breach
    the 2005 August Agreement but, in 2012, Master Graham had already reached that
    conclusion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[255]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Third, even if Kerbel was aware in 2011 that Romandale viewed the
    2005 August Agreement to be at an end, the trial judge erred in law in finding
    that the limitation period began to run as of that date. At its highest,
    Romandales statement to Kerbel that it was not going to comply with the 2005
    August Agreement amounted to an anticipatory breach of contract, not an actual
    breach of contract. An anticipatory breach does not terminate or discharge the
    contract. Where the innocent party does not accept the anticipated breach and
    continues to treat the contract as subsisting, it does not discover its claim
    for the purposes of the </span><em>Limitations Act</em><i> </i><span
lang=EN-US> and the limitation period does not begin to run  until the breach
    has occurred and the innocent party has suffered some damage. In this case,
    Kerbel made it clear that it did not accept Romandales anticipatory breach of
    the 2005 August Agreement and considered the agreement to continue in effect.
    Therefore, the limitation period did not begin to run as of 2011. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Romandale</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[256]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale says that Kerbels submission that it had no reason to
    commence an action until 2015 is contradicted by the evidence, as is Kerbels
    assertion that it did not accept Romandales anticipated repudiation and
    continued to treat the agreement as subsisting. As the trial judge found, by
    2011 Romandale was no longer acting in accordance with the 2005 August
    Agreement. Under para. 5 of that agreement, Romandale was obliged to cede
    control over development to Kerbel but it was not complying with that obligation.
    Kerbels counsel sent a letter in February 2011 asserting that Romandale was
    breaching the agreement and its conduct was actionable. Romandale did not
    comply even after that letter. The manner in which Romandale was breaching the
    2005 August Agreement demonstrated that it did not ever intend to sell the
    Lands to Kerbel. The conduct was not ambiguous: Kerbel was on notice that if it
    wanted specific performance it could not sit on its rights.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[257]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Furthermore, Romandale argues, Kerbel was not entitled to rely on
    the decisions of Master Graham and Kiteley J. in the pleadings motion to
    prevent the running of the limitation period. Those decisions did not reach a
    conclusion on the merits of the impact of the Settlement Agreement on the 2005
    August Agreement. All that was decided was that Romandales proposed amendment
    was not tenable in law.</span></p>

    (Reasons, at para. 403). That is, the trial judge concluded that Romandale had
    repudiated the 2005 August Agreement by February 2011 and Kerbel knew that.
    Consequently, the trial judge held that the 2016 Action was brought out of
    time. In my view, the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in
    finding that the two-year limitation period began running in 2011. To explain
    why, we must review the situation between Romandale and Kerbel in February 2011
    and the trial judges findings on their conduct at that time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[262]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Under para. 5 of the 2005 August Agreement, Romandale gave Kerbel
    exclusive control over the development process for the Lands. Nonetheless, by
    2011, Ms. Roman-Barber (and, at her direction, those working for her) was
    actively attempting to shut Kerbel out of the development planning process. In
    a letter dated February 17, 2011 (</span><strong>Kerbels February 2011 Letter</strong><span
lang=EN-US>), from Kerbels counsel to Romandales counsel, Kerbel complained
    about Romandales conduct, stated it was a breach of the 2005 August Agreement,
    demanded that Romandale confirm to the NMLG that Kerbels planning consultant
    had the sole authority to represent the Lands, and threatened to commence
    proceedings if Ms. Roman-Barber did not comply with the terms of para. 5 of the
    2005 August Agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[263]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>By letter dated February 25, 2011, Romandales counsel responded to
    Kerbels February 2011 Letter (the </span><strong>Responding Letter</strong><span
lang=EN-US>). In the Responding Letter, counsel for Romandale denied that Ms.
    Roman-Barber had breached the 2005 August Agreement and asserted that his
    client had, at all times, complied with the terms of that agreement. The
    Responding Letter also stated that Romandale was considering whether Kerbels
    purported settlement with [Fram] is in breach of the [2005 August] Agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[264]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>At para. 146 of the Reasons, the trial judge summarized what
    transpired between Kerbel and Romandale in the relevant time period (i.e.
    December 2010 to February 2011). Her summary includes references to Kerbels
    February 2011 Letter and the Responding Letter. Paragraph 146 ends with the
    trial judges conclusion that the evidence was clear that Romandale continued
    to exclude Kerbel from participation in the development of the Lands and Kerbel
    took no action as threatened in its letter of February 17, 2011 (the </span><strong>First
    Finding</strong><span lang=EN-US>). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[265]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Based on a consideration of precisely the same conduct as that which
    she considered in making the First Finding, the trial judge found, at para. 403
    of the Reasons, that Kerbel was aware that Romandale intended to remain the
    owner of the Lands and that from its point of view the Conditional [Provision]
    was dead (the </span><strong>Second Finding</strong><span lang=EN-US>). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[266]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The two findings are very different. The First Finding is specific
    and limited: in February 2011, Romandale was excluding Kerbel from
    participation in the development of the Lands. The Second Finding is that
    Romandales conduct put Kerbel on notice that Romandale had repudiated the
    Conditional Provision by acting as if it was dead. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[267]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Thus, the question becomes: are the two findings reconcilable? They
    are not, either on the facts or the law.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[268]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Factually, the Second Finding cannot stand in light of Romandales
    Responding Letter. In that letter, Romandales counsel denied that his client
    was in breach of the 2005 August Agreement and also stated that Romandale was
    considering whether the Settlement Agreement was a breach of the 2005 August
    Agreement. Clearly, the Responding Letter contains no express repudiation of
    its obligations under the Conditional Provision. On the contrary, in the
    Responding Letter, Romandale affirms that the 2005 August Agreement is
    operating, that it is complying with it, and that it is considering its
    position under the 2005 August Agreement as a result of Kerbel having entered
    into the Settlement Agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[269]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In terms of the law, the Second Finding was not open to the trial
    judge either. In the Reasons on this issue, when the trial judge makes the
    Second Finding, she does not explicitly refer to anticipatory breach or the
    legal principles that govern it. However, based on the parties positions on
    this issue, it appears that she made the Second Finding based on those
    principles. On that assumption, the trial judge was considering Romandales
    language and conduct in the relevant period to determine whether it could be
    construed as a repudiation of its obligations under the Conditional Provision
    before they became due for performance. In other words, the trial judge was
    considering whether Romandale had committed an anticipatory breach of the 2005
    August Agreement by indicating that it would not comply with its obligations
    under the Conditional Provision. Romandale made no express assertion to that
    effect. Therefore, the Second Finding must have been based on Romandales
    conduct. However, as I have just explained, in light of the Responding Letter
    in which Romandale affirmed the 2005 August Agreement, its conduct cannot be so
    construed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[270]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Thus, there was no anticipatory breach by Romandale of its
    obligations under the Conditional Provision in 2011 and the limitation clock
    did not begin ticking. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[271]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandales anticipatory repudiation of the 2005 August Agreement
    occurred for the first time in 2015 through its express statement to that
    effect by its new counsel. As the innocent party, Kerbel had the choice whether
    to accept the repudiation or treat the 2005 August Agreement as subsisting. It
    elected to accept the anticipatory breach and commenced the 2016 Action, which
    was within the two-year limitation period. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[272]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I note that Romandale points to other findings the trial judge made
    regarding Romandales conduct after Fram and Kerbel entered into the Settlement
    Agreement, which Romandale says demonstrate that it treated the 2005 August Agreement
    as dead. These findings relate to events that occurred after February 2011. As
    the trial judge based her determination on Kerbel having discovered its claim
    by February 2011, it is unnecessary to consider Romandales conduct falling
    after that time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[273]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I conclude on this issue with the following two points. First, it is
    trite law that not every breach of a contract amounts to a repudiation. By
    February 2011, Kerbel was aware that Romandale was in breach of para. 5 of the
    2005 August Agreement because of its conduct respecting the development process
    for the Lands. However, that breach was not a repudiation of the Conditional
    Provision. Second, even if Romandales conduct could be construed as a
    repudiation of the Conditional Provision, it was an anticipatory breach. As
    such, the limitation period did not begin running unless Kerbel accepted the
    repudiation (</span><em>Ali</em><span lang=EN-US>,<i> </i>at paras. 26-27) and
    that Kerbel did not do. On the contrary, as discussed above, Kerbel protested
    Romandales conduct in its February 2011 Letter and affirmed the validity of
    the 2005 August Agreement. Kerbel then continued its work with the NMLG in the
    development process and maintained its position in the various lawsuits that
    the 2005 August Agreement was valid and enforceable. Thus, Romandales breach
    of its obligations relating to the development process by February 2011 could
    not have started the limitation clock running. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[274]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Kerbel submits that the trial judge erred in law in rejecting its
    claim for specific performance because she ignored the uniqueness of the Lands
    to Kerbel. Instead, the trial judge focused entirely on whether the Lands were
    capable of valuation and whether substitute properties were available. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[275]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Kerbel gives five reasons for its contention that the Lands have a
    peculiar or special value to it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[276]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>First, Kerbel already owns a 4.75% undivided interest in the Lands.
    It purchased that interest with the express intention that it would become the
    owner of all of the Lands. For that reason, Romandale and it never contemplated
    what a co-owner relationship would look like (unlike Romandale and Fram which
    entered into COAs). If specific performance is not ordered, Romandale and
    Kerbel will be forced to remain as co-owners of the Lands, a relationship that
    neither expected nor wanted. Granting specific performance, however, would
    allow the parties to put an end to their fraught  and highly litigious 
    relationship. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[277]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, in light of this courts ruling in the Triple R Lands
    Litigation, Kerbel is entitled to set off the purchase price adjustment for
    those lands from the purchase price it is to pay Romandale for the Remaining
    Interest. Such a price reduction is not available for any other property that
    might come on the market and gives the Lands a quality that cannot be
    duplicated.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[278]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Third, Kerbel has already made significant investments  in time,
    money, and expertise  in the development of the Lands and surrounding
    properties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[279]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Fourth, Kerbel entered into all of the transactions in the 2005
    August Agreement with a view to its long-term plan to secure large tracts of
    undeveloped land for the purposes of development and construction. The
    transactions in the 2005 August Agreement included its purchase of the Triple R
    Lands, which adjoins the Lands, and a right of second refusal on the Elgin
    South Property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[280]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Fifth, Kerbel is not seeking specific performance of a purely executory
    contract. It is seeking performance of a contract which it has already
    substantially performed. The transactions in the 2005 August Agreement were
    intertwined and formed part of a package. Kerbel has upheld its end of the
    bargain by assuming the BNS mortgage, purchasing the initial 4.75% interest in
    the Lands, and purchasing the Triple R Lands. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[281]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Kerbel also submits that the trial judge erred in finding its claim
    for specific performance was barred by laches. It says that, in determining
    whether there has been delay amounting to laches, the main considerations are
    acquiescence on its part and any change of position by Romandale arising from
    reasonable reliance on Kerbels acceptance of the status quo. Kerbel says
    neither of those considerations applied. It never acquiesced and, as the trial
    judge found, there was no change to the status quo after the Settlement
    Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[282]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Finally, Kerbel takes issue with the trial judges statement at
    para. 406 of the Reasons that, because Romandale had spent years investing
    significant time, effort, and money into the Lands, it would be unjust to
    disrupt that by granting specific performance. It notes that the 2005 August
    Agreement required Romandale to cooperate in the development of the Lands and
    there is no injustice or prejudice that follows from compliance with its legal
    obligations. To the extent that Romandale incurred development costs, it can
    seek reimbursement from Kerbel under the terms of the 2005 August Agreement,
    just as it did in the past. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Romandale</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[283]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale submits that this court owes a high degree of deference to
    the trial judges exercise of discretion in refusing to grant specific
    performance. It argues that the trial judge did not ignore the uniqueness of
    the Lands to Kerbel  she rejected Kerbels claim of uniqueness because she
    found Mr. Kerbels own expert evidence contradicted his bald assertion that the
    Lands were unique and because the Lands were just an investment for Kerbel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[284]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US> Further, Romandale says, the trial judge considered whether substitute
    properties were available and concluded that the undeveloped Lands were not
    unique to Kerbel, a developer engaged in a profit-seeking venture, and there
    were plenty of substitute properties available. Romandale says that Kerbel has
    not articulated any palpable and overriding errors in the trial judges
    conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[285]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As for the five arguments that Kerbel advances for why the Lands are
    special and unique to it, Romandale says they are simply re-argument, which the
    trial judge was entitled to reject, as she did. Romandale says that Kerbel has
    not pointed to a palpable and overriding error in the trial judges
    determination, therefore it must stand. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[286]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On laches, Romandale says that the trial judge found both
    acquiescence and reliance and Kerbel has not cited any evidence to show the
    findings were the result of palpable and overriding error.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Specific performance is not to be ordered for breach of contract
    unless damages are inadequate. When damages are found to be inadequate, it is generally
    because of the unique nature of the property bargained for. It is for this
    reason that specific performance has historically been granted in cases
    involving the purchase and sale of real property: </span><em>Erie Sand &amp;

lang=EN-US>However, it cannot be assumed that damages for breach of contract
    for the purchase and sale of real estate will be an inadequate remedy in all
    cases. Specific performance should not be granted absent evidence the property

    v. Paramadevan</em><span lang=EN-US>, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 415, at para. 22. Whether

lang=EN-US>[290]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge declined to order specific performance largely
    because she concluded that the Lands were not unique to Kerbel. In my view, she
    erred in three ways in reaching that conclusion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[291]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>First, the trial judge erred in law in relying on the evidence of
    the experts called to provide a value for the Lands to find that the Lands were
    not unique to Kerbel. The experts had used the direct comparison approach to
    value the Lands.  That approach required the experts to find comparable
    properties with similar characteristics to the Lands. While the direct
    comparison approach is an accepted method for valuing land, it does not speak
    to whether a property is unique in the legal sense. Put another way, because
    the direct comparison approach does not address the legal requirements for
    determining whether land is unique, it cannot be used as a proxy for that
    purpose. It was an error in law to do so. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[292]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, it was a palpable and overriding error for the trial judge
    to find that the only evidence on uniqueness was Mr. Kerbels bald assertion
    to that effect. In so doing, the trial judge neglected to consider the
    following points: </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:100%'> (1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kerbel already owns a 4.75% undivided interest in the Lands and fully
    owns the adjoining property, the Triple R Lands. No other property has both
    these characteristics; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:100%'> (2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of this courts ruling in the Triple R Lands Litigation, Kerbel
    is entitled to set off the purchase price adjustment for the Triple R Lands
    from the purchase price it is to pay Romandale for the Remaining Interest. Such
    a price reduction is not available for any other property that might come on
    the market and gives the Lands a quality that cannot be duplicated; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:100%'> (3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kerbel has already made significant investments  in time, money, and
    expertise  in the development of the Lands; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:100%'> (4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With Romandales full knowledge and consent, Kerbel entered into the
    package of intertwined transactions in the 2005 August Agreement in order to
    secure a large tract of undeveloped land for the purposes of development and
    construction. The transactions in the 2005 August Agreement include Kerbels
    purchase of the Triple R Lands, which adjoins the Lands, and a right of second
    refusal on the Elgin South Property; and, </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:100%'> (5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kerbel is not seeking specific performance of a purely executory
    contract. It is seeking performance of a contract which it has already
    substantially performed. On the trial judges findings, Romandale received over
    $16.7 million of immediate value under the 2005 August Agreement. The upfront
    money Kerbel paid Romandale was to satisfy Romandales need for liquidity.
    Kerbel has upheld its end of the bargain by assuming the BNS mortgage,
    purchasing the initial 4.75% interest in the Lands, and purchasing the Triple R
    Lands. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[293]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Third, a property is unique if there is no readily available substitute
    property: </span><em>Semelhago</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 22. One method
    of proving that there is no readily available substitute is to show that the
    property has a quality that cannot be readily duplicated elsewhere: </span><em>Erie
    Sand</em><span lang=EN-US>, at paras. 115-16. The above considerations establish
    that the Lands have qualities that cannot be readily  if at all  duplicated
    elsewhere. They also show that, contrary to the trial judges finding, the
    Lands are not merely an investment for Kerbel with any number of suitable
    substitutes available. The Lands are unique to Kerbel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[294]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>While the trial judges analysis focused on the uniqueness of the
    Lands, I also view her to have fallen into error in failing to consider the
    effects of refusing to grant specific performance. In this case, if specific performance
    is not ordered, Romandale and Kerbel will remain co-owners of the Lands. As
    Kerbel points out, that situation was not expected, wanted, or provided for in
    the 2005 August Agreement. And, as the events of the past 12 years have shown,
    the situation is unworkable. This consideration militates in favour of finding
    that damages are an inadequate remedy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>First, Kerbel did not acquiesce in Romandales attempts to shut it
    out of the development process. As discussed above, counsel for Kerbel wrote to
    counsel for Romandale in February 2011, complaining about this conduct, stating
    it was a breach of Romandales obligations under the 2005 August Agreement, and
    demanding that Romandale confirm to the NMLG that Kerbels planning consultant
    had the sole authority to represent the Lands. Moreover, despite Romandales
    attempts to shut Kerbel out of the development process, Kerbel continued to be
    actively involved in the development process through the NMLG. Kerbel also
    continued to maintain that the 2005 August Agreement was in force until  in
    response to Romandales declaration in 2015 that it would not perform its
    obligations under the 2005 August Agreement  it started the 2016 Action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[297]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, Romandale did not change its position in reliance on
    Kerbels alleged acceptance of the status quo. The trial judge found, at paras.
    118-19 and 339 of the Reasons, that there was no change in Romandales behavior
    and the status quo did not change after Kerbel and Fram entered into the
    Settlement Agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[298]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, to the extent that the trial judge found reliance based on
    Romandales investment of time, money and effort into the Lands development,
    in my view she erred. Under the terms of the 2005 August Agreement, Romandale
    was obliged to cooperate with Kerbel in development of the Lands. Reliance
    cannot be claimed when it is a matter of compliance with ones legal
    obligations. And, in any event, Romandale can seek reimbursement for
    development costs from Kerbel under the terms of the 2005 August Agreement,
    just as it did in the past. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[299]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Fram asks that it be awarded damages of $11,997,500 for its loss
    respecting 50% of the Lands that go to Kerbel under the Settlement Agreement.
    Its very brief submissions are as follows. The 2005 August Agreement was a
    breach of the prohibition against Dispositions in s. 5.03 of the COAs. Upon
    breach, pursuant to s. 6.02(d) of the COAs, Romandale was obliged to sell the
    Lands to Fram for 95% of fair market value. As Romandale refused to do that,
    Fram is entitled to the difference in the market value of the Lands between
    then and trial. Fram says it mitigated its losses by entering into the
    Settlement Agreement and withdrawing its challenge to the validity of the 2005
    August Agreement. Because Romandales actions were responsible for Fram giving
    up its 50% interest in the Lands, Fram should be compensated in damages. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[300]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The foundation for Frams claim to damages is that Romandale
    breached the prohibition against Dispositions in s. 5.03 of the COAs when it entered
    into the 2005 August Agreement. However, the trial judge found against Fram on
    that matter. In paras. 168-90 of the Reasons, the trial judge gives a thorough
    explanation for her determination that Romandale did not breach the prohibition
    against Dispositions in s. 5.03 of the COAs by entering into the 2005 August
    Agreement (the </span><strong>Determination</strong><span lang=EN-US>). In
    its appeal, Fram did not challenge the Determination. Therefore, the
    Determination stands and Frams claim to damages must necessarily fail. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>By order dated April 2, 2020 (the </span><strong>Costs Order</strong><span
lang=EN-US>), the trial judge ordered costs in favour of Romandale in the
    amount of $2,708,651.57. Costs were awarded on a substantial indemnity basis
    and made payable on a joint and several basis by Fram and Kerbel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[302]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[303]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The general principle is that when an appeal is allowed, the order
    for costs below is set aside and the appellant is awarded costs below and on
    appeal: </span><em>St. Jean v. Cheung</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2009 ONCA 9, 45

    2020 ONCA 554, 449 D.L.R. (4th) 651, at para. 85. As I would allow the appeals,
    the general principle applies and the Costs Order is set aside. Thus, it is
    unnecessary to determine whether leave to appeal the Costs Order should be
    granted and, if so, whether the appeals against that order should be allowed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[304]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Based on the parties brief submissions on this matter at the oral
    hearing of the appeals, I understand that all three agree that if the appeals
    are allowed, costs below should be awarded on a partial indemnity basis.
    However, they disagree on the basis by which those costs should be determined.
    Fram and Kerbel argue that this court should fix those costs at 60% of the full
    indemnity request contained in the bills of costs they submitted at trial.
    Romandale contends that, if the parties are unable to agree on the quantum of
    partial indemnity costs, costs should be assessed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[305]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Romandale also challenges Frams entitlement to costs below. It
    submits that Fram has no appeal but, rather, only an economic interest in the
    outcome of Kerbels appeal. Consequently, if the appeals are allowed, Romandale
    says that Fram is not entitled to costs below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>For the reasons given in my determination of Romandales first alleged

    costs below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[307]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The oral submissions do not provide the court with an adequate basis
    on which to quantify the costs below for Fram and Kerbel. I trust that the
    foregoing provides the parties with sufficient guidance that they can resolve
    the quantum of costs below among themselves. If they are unable to do that, as
    indicated in the disposition below, the parties may have recourse to this court
    to resolve the matter.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[317]<span

    these propositions in turn, after restating the contractual context.</p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc67911368"></a><a

    CONTRACTUAL CONTEXT</a></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[318]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The COAs between Fram
    and Romandale respecting the McGrisken and Snider Farms were signed in 2003.
    The COAs structure the relationship between Fram and Romandale.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[319]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 2005 August Agreement
    between Kerbel and Romandale was signed in 2005. It included not only the
    McGrisken Farm and the Snider Farm, but also the Triple R Lands and the Elgin
    South Property, both of which were owned by or subject to the direction of
    Romandale. The 2005 August Agreement structures the relationship between Kerbel
    and Romandale. It has been fully performed except for the sale of Romandales
    Remaining Interest in the McGrisken and Snider Farms to Kerbel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[320]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fram and Kerbel signed
    the Settlement Agreement on December 3, 2010. The Settlement Agreement
    structures the relationship between Fram and Kerbel. Romandale was not a party
    to the Settlement Agreement. Romandale had participated in the September 2010 judicial
    mediation but withdrew in October&nbsp;2010. (I observe that calling the
    exercise a judicial mediation gives it unwarranted gravity.) In the end, the
    Settlement Agreement was a business deal between Kerbel and Fram to which
    Romandale was not a party. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[321]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Romandale first raised
    the possibility that the Settlement Agreement breached the 2005 August
    Agreement in February 2011 but did not allege that by entering it Kerbel
    repudiated the 2005 August Agreement until 2015.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[322]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I will explain, these
    three agreements remain in full force and effect and govern the parties to them.</p>

    Estoppel Ceased to Have Practical Effect When Fram Consented to the Sale of
    Romandales Remaining Interest on August 22, 2018</a></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[323]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The estoppel by
    convention raised by Kerbel and Fram against Romandale arises from the
    Settlement Agreement. Romandale argues that Kerbel repudiated the 2005 August
    Agreement by entering into the Settlement Agreement, which provided that the
    sale of Romandales Remaining Interest would take place only after the Lands
    obtained SPA. Kerbel, in turn, seeks an order for specific performance of the
    2005 August Agreement. Kerbel and Fram, together, argue that Romandale is
    estopped from resiling from Romandales earlier position that the buy-sell in
    the COAs could only be triggered upon SPA. That position was reflected in earlier
    representations to that effect made by all three parties, as my colleague has
    detailed at paras. 156-172. But for Frams 2018 consent, giving effect to this
    position would have the effect of extending the likely date for closing the
    COAs, and perforce the 2005 August Agreement, for many years, until after SPA. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[324]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague defines
    the Shared Assumptions that underpin the estoppel by convention, at para. 153:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1) the buy-sell provision in the COAs could not be triggered
    until after SPA had been achieved for the Lands; and (2) under the 2005 August
    Agreement, Kerbel could not cause Romandale to trigger the buy-sell under the
    COAs until after SPA.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>She finds that Romandale is estopped from resiling
    from these Shared Assumptions. In her analysis, the estoppel continues to
    operate and prevents Romandale from resisting on order for specific performance
    of the 2005 August Agreement on the basis that it was fundamentally breached
    and repudiated by Kerbels entry into the Settlement Agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[325]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as my
    colleague notes, the assumption that the buy-sell provision in the COAs could
    not be triggered until after SPA was a mistaken reading of s. 5.07 of the COAs.
    Romandale could have triggered the buy-sell under the COAs at any time after the
    DMAs were terminated in February 2005. Because the 2005 August Agreement was
    tied to the COAs, Kerbel could have caused Romandale to pull the trigger at any
    time after it signed that agreement. This understanding of the true trigger
    date is now common ground.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[326]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In August 2018, a few
    months before the trial started, Fram consented to the sale of Romandales
    Remaining Interest in the McGrisken and Snider Farms to Kerbel, pursuant to the
    2005 August Agreement. Under para. 2(c) of that agreement, The closing of the
    sale of the Remaining Interest shall take place sixty (60) days after Romandale
    obtaining the consent of [Fram]... to the sale of the Remaining Interest. Frams
    consent removed any obstacle to the closing of that transaction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[327]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The alleged estoppel
    prevented Romandale from insisting on an earlier closing date than after SPA, which
    by 2010 was projected to be years if not decades into the future. But this
    purpose of the estoppel was rendered redundant by Frams 2018 consent. In my
    view, assuming the estoppel was founded and was enforceable against Romandale, it
    ceased to have practical effect and plays no further legal role in the
    contractual relations among the parties. Frams consent could not have revived
    the 2005 August Agreement if it had been repudiated by Kerbel but, as I explain
    below, Kerbel did not repudiate that agreement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[328]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relations among
    the contracting parties are entirely structured and governed by their
    respective agreements, which also govern the disposition of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[329]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If I am mistaken in
    concluding that the estoppel was effectively spent in 2018, I next set out my
    reasons for holding that there was no estoppel by convention on the facts of
    this case.</p>
  <h3><a name="_Toc67911371"></a><a
name="_Toc67647754">(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Estoppel
    by Convention Is Not Made Out</a></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[330]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with the
    governing principles of estoppel by convention, review the evidence, and then apply
    the principles to the facts.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Principles Governing Estoppel by Convention</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[331]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The law on estoppel by
    convention, at least in Canada, is under-theorized. There has been little
    jurisprudence. The most authoritative statement is that of the Supreme Court in <em>Ryan v. Moore, </em>2005 SCC 38, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 53. Bastarache J. set out
    the criteria that form the basis of the doctrine, at para. 59, which I repeat here
    for convenience: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)     The parties dealings must have been based on a shared
    assumption of fact or law: estoppel requires manifest representation by
    statement or conduct creating a mutual assumption. Nevertheless, estoppel can
    arise out of <em>silence</em> (impliedly). [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2)     A party must have conducted itself, i.e. acted, in
    reliance on such shared assumption, its actions resulting in a change of its
    legal position.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3)     It must also be unjust or unfair to allow one of the
    parties to resile or depart from the common assumption. The party seeking to
    establish estoppel therefore has to prove that detriment will be suffered if
    the other party is allowed to resile from the assumption since there has been a
    change from the presumed position.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[332]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Note the reference by
    Bastarache J. to the requirement for a manifest representation. This
    expression must be read in context. The key difference between estoppel by
    representation and estoppel by convention is that in estoppel by
    representation, one party must make a representation to the other party on
    which the other party relies, whereas, in estoppel by convention, neither party
    need have made a representation to the other party so long as they both proceeded
    on a shared assumption and were each aware of the others assumption: see <em>Ryan
    v. Moore</em>, at paras. 54, 62. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[333]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Grasshopper
    Solar Corporation v. Independent Electricity System Operator</em>, 2020 ONCA
    499, leave to appeal refused, [2020] S.C.C.A. No. 360 and No. 361, Huscroft
    J.A. made explicit another element of the test that I believe was implicit: the
    partys reliance on the shared assumption must have been reasonable. Huscroft
    J.A. noted, at para 54:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Although the doctrine of estoppel cannot vary the terms of a
    contract, it may operate to prevent a party from relying on the terms of the
    contract <span class=Underline>to the extent necessary to protect the
    reasonable reliance of the other party</span>. Thus, the doctrine has the potential
    to undermine the certainty of contract and must be applied with care,
    especially in the context of commercial relationships between sophisticated
    parties represented by counsel. Estoppel is a fact specific doctrine and the
    concern noted by Bastarache J. in <em>Moore</em>, at para. 50 remains apposite:
    &quot;estoppels are to be received with caution and applied with care&quot;. [Emphasis
    added, citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[334]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Huscroft J.A. added,
    at para. 55, that estoppel by convention is a relatively rare form of estoppel,
    and, at para. 56, Estoppel exists to protect <em>reasonable</em> reliance: it
    must be reasonable to adopt a particular assumption and reasonable to act in
    reliance on it (emphasis in original, citations omitted).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[335]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This orientation anchors
    estoppel by convention in the root principle of the common law of contract,
    which is to give effect to the reasonable expectations of contracting parties
    as set out in the text of their contract: see <em>Martin v. American
    International Assurance Life Co.</em>, 2003 SCC 16, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 158, at
    paras. 12, 16; <em>Ledcor Construction Ltd. v. Northbridge Indemnity Insurance
    Co.</em>, 2016 SCC 37, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 23, at para. 5; <em>Onex Corp. v.
    American Home Assurance Co.</em>,<em> </em>2013 ONCA 117, 114 O.R. (3d) 161, at
    paras. 106, 108, leave to appeal refused, [2013] S.C.C.A. No. 178; and <em>Dumbrell
    v. The Regional Group of Companies Inc.</em>, 2007 ONCA 59, 85 O.R. (3d) 616, at
    paras. 51-53.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[336]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parol evidence figures
    in this case. Evidence of what a party said or did is often admissible as part
    of the narrative of a contractual dispute. It is undoubtedly admissible to
    found an estoppel, as stated in<em> Chartbrook Limited v. Persimmon Homes
    Limited</em>, [2009] UKHL 38, at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The rule excludes evidence of what was said or done during the
    course of negotiating the agreement for the purpose of drawing inferences about
    what the contract meant. It does not exclude the use of such evidence for other
    purposes: for example, to establish that a fact which may be relevant as
    background was known to the parties, <span class=Underline>or to support a
    claim for rectification or estoppel. These are not exceptions to the rule. They
    operate outside it</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[337]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such evidence is also
    available, by necessary implication, to challenge the veracity of an estoppel.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[338]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the trial judge
    explained, the mistaken view of the trigger date appears to have originated in
    some correspondence from counsel for Fram in February 2007. It was then perpetuated
    in many statements, as my colleague outlines at paras. 156-172. Often, these
    statements were made by Romandales own representatives. This mistake was
    apparently not discovered until 2015 when Romandales new counsel pointed it
    out and it became the factual backbone to Romandales litigation strategy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[339]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge described
    the situation, at paras. 103-105:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is Romandale's position that &quot;amidst the to-ing and
    fro-ing&quot; of Fram and Romandale's counsel in respect of Romandale's alleged
    breach of the COAs, Fram's counsel set in motion a mischaracterization of the
    availability of the Buy-Sell in s. 5.07 of the COAs that pervaded subsequent
    pleadings and affidavits relied on by the parties and that was ultimately
    identified and rectified by Romandale in 2015 when it changed counsel. It is
    alleged that this began in a letter dated February 26, 2007, when counsel for
    Fram wrote to counsel for Romandale alleging a breach of the COAs and
    asserting:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>The Elgin Mills Lands have not received Secondary Plan
    Approval, as defined in Section 5.07(a) in each of the Co-ownership Agreements.
    Therefore, the provisions dealing with Dispositions set out in Section 5.04,
    5.05 and 5.07 are inapplicable.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Whether or not this was the first time this incorrect position
    was stated or not, this position was clearly wrong in that as I have already
    stated, the Buy-Sell could also be triggered after termination of the DMAs,
    even <span class=Underline>before SPA</span>, which I have found occurred in
    February 2005. This error in summarizing the Buy-Sell provisions of the COAs as
    only being available after SPA was also taken up by Kerbel and Romandale. For
    example, in the first recital to the Settlement Agreement the COAs are referred
    to, and with respect to the Buy-Sell provisions it is stated that &quot;the
    rights may only be exercised <span class=Underline>after secondary plan
    approval</span> has been obtained for the Lands ...&quot; [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=CQuote>When Ms. Batner was retained by Romandale in 2015, Romandale
    was granted leave to amend its Statement of Defence to correct the
    mischaracterization that had pervaded the pleadings and tainted the parties'
    evidence until that time. As already stated, this error explains the evidence
    of Mrs. Roman-Barber and the positions of Romandale's former counsel in the
    period from 2007 to the time Ms. Batner was retained.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[340]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague
    identifies the assumption that the buy-sell provision in the COAs could not be
    triggered until after SPA as the shared assumption on which estoppel by
    convention arises. This assumption, in her view, was held by all of the parties
    in 2010 when the Settlement Agreement was negotiated. Candidly, I doubt the
    veracity of this assertion, at least as it relates to Kerbel and Fram, and
    particularly to Mr. Kerbel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[341]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that
    Mr. Kerbel knew he could have caused Romandale to trigger the buy-sell under
    the COAs at any time, because the DMAs had been terminated in February 2005:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In his affidavit Mr. Kerbel swore that he and Mrs. Roman-Barber
    deliberately agreed to defer triggering the Buy-Sell in the August 2005
    Agreement until <span class=Underline>after SPA</span> because of Mr. Kerbel's
    reluctance to being dragged into the existing Bordeaux litigation regarding the
    DMAs and that their lawyers drafted the August 2005 Agreement to provide for
    this. He testified that he and Mrs. Roman-Barber and their lawyers agreed
    &quot;and we specifically took [the DMAs] out of our deal because no judge had
    said [Bordeaux] was terminated&quot;.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Romandale argues that this was false evidence and I agree.
    First of all, Mr. Kerbel abandoned that position during his cross-examination,
    when he admitted he could have caused Romandale to trigger the Buy-Sell <span
class=Underline>before SPA</span> under the August 2005 Agreement, and indeed
    that he would have when the Bordeaux litigation resolved:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>Q: [...<span class=Underline>I]f the Bordeaux litigation
    settled, you would have caused Romandale to trigger the buy/sell</span>. You

  <p class=DSubquote>Q: So when you say the timing was &quot;as soon as I
    could&quot;, that just goes back to our last discussion. <span class=Underline>As
    soon as possible, as soon as you were satisfied that the Bordeaux litigation

  <p class=DSubquote>A: <span class=Underline>Yes, I would have.</span> [Emphasis
    added by the trial judge.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[342]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge stated,
    at para. 314, that the pith and substance of the 2005 August Agreement was an
    expedient land sale (Kerbel gets the Lands and Romandale gets the equity it required)
    without breaching the existing Land agreements [with Fram]. She noted
    accurately: There was zero benefit to Romandale in putting off closing. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[343]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What changed for all
    the participants was the development horizon. The trigger date acquired new saliency
    in 2009, when government decisions introduced a long delay in the development
    horizon. From development approvals that were, in 2005, anticipated in a few
    years, the development horizon went out many years, perhaps decades. The likely
    land use designations also changed, with the Snider Farm proposed for
    employment use, not residential development, reducing both the value of the
    Lands and Frams incentive as a home builder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[344]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I noted in this
    courts decision in <em>First Elgin Mills Developments Inc. v. Romandale Farms
    Limited</em>, 2014 ONCA 573, 324 O.A.C. 153, at paras. 31-32: The process of
    moving raw land through the land development process is complex, time
    consuming, and expensive. I added: The outcome is frequently uncertain. This
    is known to experienced land developers like Kerbel and Fram and experienced
    owners of development lands like Romandale. The agreements between the parties were
    built around these uncertainties, which came to pass in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[345]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of the changes
    in the development horizon and the likely development permissions, both Kerbel
    and Fram had a substantially reduced appetite to complete the transactions
    contemplated by the COAs and the 2005 August Agreement. The trial judge
    explained:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Both Mr. Giannone and Mr. Kerbel acknowledged at trial that
    these developments concerned them. They both admitted that they would have
    preferred shorter development timelines and a residential designation for the
    Snider Farm, as residential use would have made for a significantly better
    investment. Fram would have preferred residential land use rather than
    employment land use as the real way that Fram was to make money was largely
    tied to its homebuilding rights under the CMAs, which would be dead if the
    Lands remained employment lands.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mr. Kerbel admitted that by 2009 as a result of these
    developments, he was no longer in the mindset of closing with Romandale as soon
    as possible. Mr. Giannone admitted that by 2010 the Lands were a materially
    &quot;different product&quot;. Mr. Giannone also admitted that because of his
    concerns about the real estate market, when he entered into the Settlement
    Agreement with Kerbel, he was not committed to buying half of Romandale's
    remaining interest in the Lands. He wanted to have that option in the future. He
    was careful to ensure that by entering into the Settlement Agreement it could
    not be construed a consent under the Conditional Agreement because if Fram had
    consented, the deal between Romandale and Kerbel could have closed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[346]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I make several observations
    about where things stood upon execution of the Settlement Agreement by Kerbel
    and Fram. It was drafted by Kerbel and Fram to reflect their interests. It was
    an advantageous deal for two canny land developers, entirely at the risk and
    cost of the majority landowner, Romandale. The Settlement Agreement states
    that, under the COAs, the buy-sell could only be exercised after SPA had been
    obtained and that Romandale would sell its Remaining Interest to Kerbel under
    the 2005 August Agreement when the buy-sell could be exercised or when Fram
    consented. The Settlement Agreement goes on to provide that the sale of
    Romandales Remaining Interest to Kerbel will take place after SPA is
    obtained. Effectively, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Kerbel
    agreed not to cause Romandale to trigger the buy-sell provision under the COAs
    as it was empowered to do under the 2005 August Agreement. This elongation of
    time spared both Kerbel and Fram the obligation to come up with the money to
    finance the acquisition of land whose value had become uncertain, until SPA,
    when its value could be ascertained.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[347]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This allowed Kerbel to
    put off paying Romandale the fixed price of $160,000&nbsp;per acre, negotiated
    in 2005, for many years, perhaps decades. With inflation over the ensuing years,
    the constant dollar value of the land would decline over that time at the sole
    expense of Romandale.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[348]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This also saved Fram,
    for the same period of time, from having to respond to the buy-sell provision
    in the COAs. Fram instead acquired a solid development partner, in Kerbel, with
    whom to share acquisition and development costs, and risks. And both Fram and
    Kerbel, being formidable adversaries, eliminated litigation risk and cost
    between them by settling their actions against each other.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Principles Applied</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[349]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    invocation by Kerbel and Fram of estoppel by convention fails. Any application
    of estoppel by convention in this case requires this court to account for the
    role that the supposedly shared but mistaken assumption regarding the interpretation
    of the COAs actually played in the formation of the Settlement Agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[350]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given Mr. Kerbels
    evidence that he knew the buy-sell could be triggered after the termination of
    the DMAs, and before SPA, as quoted by the trial judge and repeated at para. 341,
    above, it is very unlikely that Kerbel in particular, and Fram by implication,
    shared in Romandales mistaken interpretation of the trigger date in the COAs. I
    infer that it is much more likely that they knowingly took advantage of Romandales
    mistaken view, which had been repeated on many occasions. Ignorance of the true
    trigger date on the part of Kerbel and Fram, two savvy land developers, is
    highly implausible. Kerbel and Fram used the trigger date as a vehicle to put
    off payment to Romandale indefinitely.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[351]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague alludes
    to the fact that none of the parties to this appeal resisted the claim that
    they had all shared in the mistaken assumption that the buy-sell could only be
    triggered after SPA.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[352]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that
    estoppel by convention was not resisted on this basis. However, the trial judge
    found, at para. 87, that Mr. Kerbel knew that [the buy-sell] could be
    triggered before SPA after termination of the DMAs. At para. 89, she found Mr.&nbsp;Kerbels
    evidence that he had forgotten this fact disingenuous. A finding that Kerbel
    shared in the mistaken shared assumption that my colleague identifies is
    inconsistent with the trial judges findings, to which I would defer as factual
    determinations of credibility. The inferences I have drawn from these
    determinations are inescapable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[353]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, estoppels
    are to be received with caution and applied with care: <em>Ryan v. Moore</em>,
    at para. 50. Because the doctrine has the potential to undermine the certainty
    of contract [it] must be applied with care, especially in the context of
    commercial relationships between sophisticated parties represented by counsel: <em>Grasshopper Solar</em>, at para. 54, <em>per </em>Huscroft J.A. Applying due
    caution and care, I cannot find an estoppel by convention where, given the
    evidence, one does not arise on the facts and the law, however argued by
    parties whose concern is less for the law than for their individual advantage. Here,
    the claimed estoppel by convention cannot survive Mr. Kerbels knowledge, when
    the Settlement Agreement was negotiated, that the shared assumption was
    mistaken. This can be seen in two ways.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[354]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, given the fact
    of Mr. Kerbels knowledge, I have difficulty accepting that the assumption that
    the buy-sell could not be triggered until after SPA was shared in the manner
    required for estoppel by convention. Bastarache J. notes that the crucial
    requirement for estoppel by convention, which distinguishes it from the other
    types of estoppel, is that at the material time both parties must be of a like
    mind: <em>Ryan v. Moore</em>, at para. 61 (citations omitted). Further,
    estoppel by convention requires mutual assent: <em>Ryan v. Moore</em>, at
    para. 62. Where one party knows that the other party is mistaken and chooses to
    acquiesce in their mistake rather than correct it, they were plainly not of
    like minds nor did they mutually assent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[355]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Mr. Kerbels
    knowledge that the assumption was incorrect renders unreasonable any reliance by
    Kerbel and Fram on the mistaken trigger date. Mr.&nbsp;Kerbel was under no
    illusion that this reading was not correct, as the trial judge found. Nor had
    he forgotten what the correct reading was, as she also found. As noted above, I
    would defer to those findings as factual determinations of credibility. They
    also comport with the commercial realities. It was not reasonable of Kerbel and
    Fram to rely on Romandales interpretation of the trigger date, knowing that it
    was mistaken.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[356]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These two reasons are
    sufficient to dismiss the estoppel by convention arguments put forward by
    Kerbel and Fram. I conclude that the legal basis for estoppel by convention is
    not made out on the facts of this case. This conclusion obliges me to consider
    whether Kerbel repudiated or breached the 2005 August Agreement, a task that my
    colleague was spared by her view of estoppel, and to which I now turn.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:normal'><a name="_Toc67911372"></a><a
name="_Toc67647755">(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kerbel
    Did Not Breach the 2005 August Agreement by Entering Into the Settlement
    Agreement with Fram</a></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[357]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is necessary to put
    the 2005 August Agreement in its proper context or factual matrix before
    assessing whether the trial judge properly assessed Kerbels alleged breaches.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Context</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[358]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court must survey
    the contractual landscape in this case with a clear eye. In my view, the trial
    judges manifest sympathy for Romandale was misplaced. Romandale did not occupy
    the moral high ground in this bruising corporate battle, as I will explain.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[359]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is a truism that
    contracting parties seek their own ends. An important aspect of contractual
    design, as Swan and Adamski observe, at p. 148, is allocating risk between the contracting
    parties:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[M]uch contract drafting is focused on the allocation of risk,
    on the need to make clear just how the risks associated with an activity or the
    actual operation of the contractual relation, are not only allocated but
    understood to be allocated. It is bizarre for a court to be  or to appear to
    be  unaware of this role, one performed by the majority of members of the
    legal profession. Solicitors would be aghast if a court, in interpreting a
    contract, were to focus on the parties intentions and ignore the efforts of
    one party to shape the others expectations, in the light of what the first
    party was prepared to do. Such intentions are nothing but a judicial
    construct, a chimera, and wholly fanciful.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[360]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The root contractual
    documents in this case are the 2003 COAs between Romandale and Fram. Romandale
    was looking for a land developer to assist it in bringing the Lands to the
    point at which they could be used for residential purposes. Fram became
    Romandales business partner for this purpose. As the trial judge found:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The plan was that Romandale and Fram would own the Lands and
    Bordeaux would manage the requirements for the development of the Lands, so
    they could be designated for residential use following [SPA], a stage of the
    municipal planning approvals process, Fram would then buy lots at market value
    and build homes and share the profits with Romandale. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[361]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The COAs, and the buy-sell
    provision in particular, were carefully designed to allow each party to extract
    the maximum value for its interest in the Lands at the point that either party chose
    to force the other to buy its interest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[362]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By entering the COAs, Romandale
    got money (by selling the five percent interest in the Lands to Fram) and Fram
    got an exclusive option to purchase Romandales remaining interest. The key
    problem with the COAs was that Romandale was effectively stuck with Fram as a
    partner in developing the Lands. The COAs permitted Romandale to sell its
    remaining interest in the Lands to another developer, but only with Frams
    consent. Crucially, Frams consent, per s.&nbsp;5.03 of the COAs, may be
    unreasonably or arbitrarily withheld, giving it control over any large
    disposition of the Lands by Romandale. (This provision was not unbalanced
    because it permitted Romandale to refuse consent to a disposition by Fram of
    its interest on the same basis.)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[363]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Romandales need
    and appetite for money grew, it asked Fram to increase its interest in the Lands
    but Fram declined. Romandales need for more money, coupled with Frams
    reluctance to invest more, drove Romandale into a deal with Kerbel. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 2005 August Agreement Favoured Kerbel</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[364]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 2005 August
    Agreement was cleverly designed to accomplish Romandales end of getting cash
    without breaching the COAs with Fram. Romandale did get more money. But Kerbel
    drove a careful bargain, recognizing both Romandales need for cash and the
    difficult and complex situation that the COAs posed for Kerbel with respect to
    Frams interest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[365]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 2005 August
    Agreement was drafted in Kerbels favour. This is not a surprise. Romandale had
    a strong need for funds and Kerbel was the able funder. As the trial judge
    stated, at para. 69, Romandale needed to refinance a $6,000,000 Bank of Nova
    Scotia (BNS) mortgage on the Lands and wanted cash to make distributions to
    Romandale and Roman family members. She noted, at para. 329, Romandale
    actually received $16,703,000 of immediate value from Kerbel: $6,000,000 in new
    mortgage financing to retire the BNS Mortgage, $2,128,000 cash on the sale of
    5% of the Elgin Mills Lands owned by Romandale, and $8,575,000 cash was paid on
    the sale of the Triple R Lands.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[366]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The text of the 2005
    August Agreement ceded a large measure of control to Kerbel, although it was
    constrained by Romandales need and obligation to continue to comply with the
    COAs. The agreement appointed Kerbel as attorney and agent for Romandale in
    material and specific respects. Section 5 was entitled &quot;Irrevocable
    Appointment&quot; and provides in part:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>... Romandale hereby irrevocably appoints [Kerbel] as its
    exclusive <span class=Underline>true and lawful attorney and agent having full
    power of substitution, and [Kerbel] is hereby fully authorized as such to act
    on behalf of and/or give binding instructions to Romandale solely in connection
    with the exercise of the buy-sell rights pursuant to the Buy-Sell Provisions</span> (as hereinafter defined). <span class=Underline>Romandale agrees that any and
    all decisions, operations, conduct and actions relating to the development of
    the Snider/McGrisken Property shall be within the exclusive control of [Kerbel]
    and Romandale shall assist in facilitating such control to comply with Section
    5.10 of the Co-Owners Agreements over all decisions; operations, conduct and
    action exercisable by Romandale relating to the development and obtaining of
    development approvals</span> for the Snider/McGrisken Property.... Romandale
    and [Kerbel] shall cooperate in getting the Snider/McGrisken Property included
    under the Town of Markham urban envelope for development purposes, and Romandale
    shall take all reasonable steps to reduce land wastage to as small an amount as
    possible, using Joanne Burnett, Jeff Kerbel and/or his designate to act on
    behalf of Romandale in taking such steps. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[367]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The control that Romandale
    granted to Kerbel was related to compliance with the COAs, as the trial judge found
    at para. 202. She noted, at para. 203, that Romandale continued to exercise
    control of the development process throughout.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[368]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    correctly observed, at para. 202: The opening sentence provides that Romandale
    appoints [Kerbel] as its agent solely in connection with the Buy-Sell
    provisions in the COAs. The trial judge added: This makes sense as it was
    Kerbel's intention to buy Romandale's remaining interest in the Lands and so it
    would want control over <span class=Underline>when</span> Romandale triggered
    the Buy-Sell (emphasis added). I agree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[369]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy that the
    2005 August Agreement did not bind Kerbel to a date by which it was required to
    pull the buy-sell trigger in the COAs. Although Mr.&nbsp;Kerbel testified to
    his reluctance to trigger the provision while Romandale was litigating with
    Bordeaux, nothing in the 2005 August Agreement required him to pull the trigger
    when that litigation ended, even though, as the trial judge observed, the
    Bordeaux litigation was expressly referred to in s. 2(e). (Recall that the
    Bordeaux litigation was settled in October 2014.)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[370]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only Frams consent to
    the sale of Romandales Remaining Interest to Kerbel under the 2005 August
    Agreement could force Kerbel to close.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[371]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite finding that
    Kerbel would have wanted control over the timing of the triggering of the
    buy-sell, the trial judge later found, somewhat inconsistently, at paras.
    299-300, that the intention of the parties was to close as soon as possible and
    Kerbels discretion on when the buy-sell would be triggered was not so broad
    as to allow it to transform a deal that was intended to close as soon as
    possible into a deal that was not to close until decades away. She relied on
    the time is of the essence clause in para. 7 (c) of the 2005 August Agreement
    for this finding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[372]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with my
    colleagues statement, at para. 233, that the time is of the essence clause
    cannot be construed to mean that a short closing horizon was part of the pith
    and substance of the contract. With respect, the trial judge misapprehended
    the purpose and role of a time is of the essence clause in commercial
    contracts. Such a clause is engaged where a time limit is stipulated; it does
    not serve to impose a time limit but rather dictates the consequences that flow
    from failing to comply with a time limit stipulated in an agreement: see <em>Di
    Millo v. 2099232 Ontario Inc.</em>, 2018 ONCA 1051, 430 D.L.R. (4th) 296, at
    paras. 31-37, leave to appeal refused, [2019] S.C.C.A. No. 55. Benotto J.A. noted,
    in <em>Di Millo</em>, at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Notably, while the option clause includes two time limits, it
    is silent as to the time limit for exercising the option. However, the
    application judge found, that providing notice to the Respondent that complies
    with the Agreement, 6 months after the option first arose, does not comply with
    the&nbsp;time is of the essence&nbsp;clause. In my view, he erred in finding
    that the time is of the essence clause was engaged where no time was
    stipulated in the contract for exercising the option and in finding that there
    was non-compliance with the time is of the essence clause. Those errors
    tainted his finding that the option had expired by the time the appellant gave
    notice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>Those words apply here with necessary modifications.
    The trial judges reliance on the time is of the essence clause was an error
    of law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[373]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Kerbel testified
    that, in the early days when the development process looked like it would move
    quickly to a happy outcome, he wanted to close quickly. But the trial judge
    misapprehended this evidence to impose a contractual obligation on Kerbel to
    close as soon as possible, regardless. There is no express obligation in the
    2005 August Agreement to close as soon as possible and there is no legal basis
    for implying one. Implying such an obligation is neither necessary to give
    business efficacy to the contract, nor would it pass the officious bystander
    test: see <em>Energy Fundamentals Group Inc. v. Veresen Inc.</em>, 2015 ONCA
    514, 388 D.L.R. (4th) 672, at paras. 30-31;<em> M.J.B. Enterprises Ltd. v.
    Defence Construction (1951) Ltd.</em>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 619, at para. 27; <em>Canadian
    Pacific Hotels Ltd. v. Bank of Montreal</em>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 711, at p. 775. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[374]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 2005 August
    Agreement provided Kerbel with other advantages. The fixed-price of $160,000
    per acre to be paid to Romandale on closing was above the 2005 current market
    value for the McGrisken and Snider Farms but the fact that it was a fixed-price
    contract minimized the risk to Kerbel and capped Romandales return. In other
    words, Romandale gave up its right to share in any increases in the value of
    the Lands, to Kerbels benefit. Had the development horizon contemplated by the
    parties in 2005 been met, then Romandales return would have been limited to
    the fixed-price; any increase in the value of the Lands thereafter would have
    been enjoyed by either Kerbel or Fram. One of them would have ended up with the
    Lands at a higher price through the buy-sell mechanism in the COAs, if they did
    not come to some other agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[375]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 2005 August
    Agreement gave Romandale the opportunity to carry out an end run on Fram and
    its exclusive option to buy the rest of the Lands. The agreement was cleverly
    designed but it put Fram and Kerbel on a collision course.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Settlement Agreement</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[376]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted earlier, the
    development horizon changed substantially. By 2010, Kerbel and Fram were in
    lawsuits with each other. Neither was anxious to acquire all of the Lands
    immediately through the operation of the buy-sell provision, nor did they wish
    to give up their interests in the land. Their way out of the impasse was the
    Settlement Agreement, by which they ended up sharing costs. This was a
    practical outcome for experienced land developers.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[377]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Romandales revised
    litigation strategy targeted s. 5 of the Settlement Agreement:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Fram] does not by this settlement agreement or otherwise
    consent to the transaction referred to in paragraph 2 of the August 29, 2005
    Agreement. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the purchase and sale
    of Romandales Remaining Interest in the Lands pursuant to these Minutes of
    Settlement will take place after Secondary Plan Approval for the Lands has been
    obtained.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[378]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found
    that Kerbel breached the 2005 August Agreement, at para. 310: By entering into
    the Settlement Agreement, Kerbel totally fettered its discretion as to when to
    cause Romandale to trigger the Buy-Sell just because it no longer wanted to
    close the purchase of Romandale's Remaining Interest quickly.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[379]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial judge
    found, at para. 319, that Kerbel had a fiduciary duty to Romandale that it
    breached by entering into the Settlement Agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[380]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no scope for
    the imposition of fiduciary duties on Kerbel. That would oblige Kerbel to act
    solely in the best interests of Romandale, which is the antithesis of the
    self-interest that contracting parties in commercial contracts are generally entitled
    to pursue. In <em>Hodgkinson v. Simms</em>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377, [1994] S.C.J.
    No. 84, the court said, at p. 414, para. 38:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Commercial interactions between parties at arm's length
    normally derive their social utility from the pursuit of self&#8209;interest,
    and the courts are rightly circumspect when asked to enforce a duty (i.e., the
    fiduciary duty) that vindicates the very antithesis of self&#8209;interest. [T]he
    law does not object to one party taking advantage of another&nbsp;<em>per se</em>,
    so long as the particular form of advantage taking is not otherwise objectionable.
    [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[381]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted, the wording
    of the 2005 August Agreement was in Kerbels favour in order to avoid any such
    subordination either to Romandale entirely or to some notional conception of
    their mutual best interests, as Romandale argues. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[382]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is possible for a
    contracting party to accept a fiduciary duty. Romandale submits that because
    the 2005 August Agreement explicitly made Kerbel Romandales lawful attorney
    and agent for some purposes, that principle is applicable here. But this
    misconstrues the purpose of Kerbels appointment as Romandales attorney and
    agent, which was to leave the timing of the triggering of the buy-sell under
    the COAs in Kerbels sole control without any further dependence on Romandale. Kerbel,
    as the funder, wanted to control all aspects of the exercise of the buy-sell provisions
    in the COAs. As the trial judge herself stated, this made sense. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[383]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would set aside the
    trial judges holding that Kerbel owed Romandale a fiduciary duty as an error
    in law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[384]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial
    judge found, at para. 310, that Kerbel breached its duty of good faith to
    Romandale under the 2005 August Agreement:</p>
  <p class=CQuote> By entering into the Settlement Agreement with Fram, Kerbel
    acted in its own self-interest, to the detriment of Romandale's interests.
    Kerbel undermined the entire value of the August 2005 Agreement for Romandale.
    Without a doubt Kerbel did not act in good faith.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[385]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    invoked the the duty to act in good faith citing <em>Bhasin v. Hrynew</em>, 2014
    SCC 71, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 494, at para. 65, and the expectation that a party
    exercising discretion is required to do so in good faith, citing <em>Greenberg
    v. Meffert </em>(1985), 50 O.R. (2d) 755 (C.A.), at paras. 18 and 26, leave to
    appeal refused, [1985] 2 S.C.R. ix. Had the authorities been available, the
    trial judge would likely have invoked <em>C.M. Callow Inc. v. Zollinger</em>, 2020
    SCC 45, and <em>Wastech Services Ltd. v. Greater Vancouver Sewerage and
    Drainage District</em>, 2021 SCC 7, for the same propositions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[386]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree. It is
    not obvious to me what role the doctrine of good faith in contractual
    performance should play in this complex commercial setting. Courts should be
    very reluctant to interfere in the dealings of hard-headed business people
    pursuing their competitive goals. This pursuit is not forbidden in a market
    economy: it is expected, as the Supreme Court observed in <em>Hodgkinson</em>, at
    p. 414, para. 38, quoted earlier.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[387]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties were
    sophisticated, resourced and professionally advised throughout. No doubt both
    Fram and Kerbel have deeper pockets but there is no scope for invoking the
    concept of unequal bargaining power in this context without, by necessary
    implication, imperilling any larger corporations ability to engage in commerce
    with smaller entities. The language in all of the agreements was carefully
    negotiated and chosen to allocate the parties respective risks and
    responsibilities, benefits and burdens. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[388]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case illustrates
    operations in the real world. To achieve its ends, in negotiating the
    Settlement Agreement with Fram, Kerbel essentially pulled the same move on
    Romandale that Romandale had pulled on Fram in entering into the 2005 August
    Agreement with Kerbel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[389]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seen through the good
    faith lens, Romandale could be criticized for defeating Frams exclusive option
    to the Lands via the 2005 August Agreement with Kerbel. But all Romandale was
    doing was pursuing its own ends within the limits of the contractual language
    in the COAs in order to raise cash by extracting value from all of its lands,
    including the McGrisken and Snider Farms. (I note that by entering into the
    2005 August Agreement, Romandale did not breach the COAs, contrary to Frams
    assertions in the 2007 and 2008 actions. The trial judge dismissed those
    actions and Fram did not appeal the dismissals.)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[390]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, by entering
    into the Settlement Agreement, all Kerbel was doing was pursuing its own ends
    within the limits of the contractual language in the 2005 August Agreement in
    order to reduce its exposure to the land and to the risks posed by the
    litigation with Fram. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[391]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The text of a contract
    matters in discerning the parties reasonable expectations. Kerbel never
    undertook to perform its obligations under the 2005 August Agreement for
    Romandales benefit, or even for their mutual benefit, as Romandale argues.
    The parties reasonably expected that the commercial realities would pressure
    all sides to move with alacrity. But Kerbel did not bind itself to do so,
    wisely in retrospect, given how the commercial realities have changed. This is
    not unusual in the fraught sphere of land development in Ontario, and particularly
    in the area surrounding Toronto. What gutted the transactions was not the
    Settlement Agreement but the changed development horizon that affected all the
    parties adversely.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[392]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor is it clear to me
    what the invocation of good faith performance would contribute in this setting.
    I note the submission, recorded by the trial judge, at para. &nbsp;326: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Romandale submits that it need not point to a specific date on
    which Kerbel must have caused it to trigger the Buy-Sell, nor does this Court
    need to pinpoint a date, in order to find that a fiduciary duty existed or to
    find that there has been a repudiatory breach arising from Kerbel's breach of
    same (among other contractual obligations). In this case, it is clear the line
    was crossed when Kerbel settled with Fram in 2010 and deliberately ensured the
    Buy-Sell would never be triggered before SPA (if at all), in furtherance of its
    own self-interests and in complete contravention of Romandale's interests.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[393]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Romandales refusal to
    specify a date is noteworthy because if the date does not comport with Kerbels
    best business interests, as permitted by the 2005 August Agreement, it would be
    purely arbitrary. I note in passing that the earliest date would be after the
    Bordeaux litigation settled, which was in October 2014. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[394]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor is it clear to me
    that, had Kerbel and Fram never entered into the Settlement Agreement and had
    Fram not consented to the sale, there would be any obligation on Kerbel even <span
class=Underline>today</span> to cause Romandale to trigger the buy-sell
    provision in the COAs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[395]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I note that
    if there is a right date for the transfer of Romandales Remaining Interest
    to Kerbel, it would be sixty days after Fram consented to that transaction in
    2018, as that is precisely what is stipulated in the 2005 August Agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[396]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To conclude, the trial
    judge erred in finding that Kerbel breached the 2005 August Agreement and its
    duty of good faith performance by entering into the Settlement Agreement with
    Fram. I do not find any basis here for judicial tweaking via the doctrine of
    good faith performance, or for any judicial interference in the ordinary
    operation of these carefully negotiated contracts, which embody the reasonable
    expectations of the parties and which are fully capable of execution on their
    precise terms.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[397]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If Kerbel breached the
    2005 August Agreement by entering into the Settlement Agreement with Fram, then
    that breach would have to be taken into account in the exercise of discretion
    as to whether to order specific performance. The behaviour of the parties is a
    relevant consideration in deciding whether to order specific performance: <em>Matthew
    Brady Self Storage Corporation v. InStorage Limited Partnership</em>, 2014 ONCA
    858, 125 O.R. (3d) 121, at para. 32, leave to appeal refused, [2015] S.C.C.A.
    No. 50; <em>Paterson Veterinary Professional Corporation v. Stilton Corp. Ltd.</em>,
    2019 ONCA 746, 438 D.L.R. (4th) 374, at para. 31, leave to appeal refused,
    [2019] S.C.C.A. No. 420. But here there is no such breach.</p>

name="_Toc67647756">(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    Entering Into the Settlement Agreement, Kerbel Did Not Repudiate Its Obligations
    Under the 2005 August Agreement.</a></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[398]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because I have found
    that Kerbel did not breach the 2005 August Agreement, on that ground alone,
    there is no basis for finding that Kerbel repudiated that agreement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[399]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in my view
    the trial judges approach to the repudiation issue was wrong in principle and
    requires comment. Recall that Romandale argued that it is not required to close
    the 2005 August Agreement because Kerbel had repudiated that agreement by
    entering into the Settlement Agreement. The trial judge agreed and refused
    Kerbels request for an order compelling Romandale to specifically perform the
    2005 August Agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[400]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    deconstructed the 2005 August Agreement into constituent parts. This approach
    was wrong in principle. She extracted the conveyance of the McGrisken and
    Snider Farms from the 2005 August Agreement in order to deem that part of the
    agreement repudiated. This approach is not consistent with the holistic
    approach courts must take to carefully negotiated commercial agreements. Just
    as a court interpreting a contract must read the contract as a whole, a court analyzing
    whether a fundamental breach amounting to repudiation has occurred should
    consider both the alleged breach, and the obligations the breaching party has
    performed, in relation to the breaching partys obligations under the whole contract: <em>Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp.</em>, 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2
    S.C.R. 633, at para. 47; <a name="_Hlk67054993"><em>1193430 Ontario Inc. v.
    Boa-Franc Inc. </em>(2005), 260 D.L.R. (4th) 659 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 50</a>,<em> </em>leave to appeal refused, [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 2.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[401]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the
    trial judge erred in recruiting the doctrine of repudiation, because of the
    substantial prior performance on Kerbels part, which was valued by the trial
    judge at about $16 million. There is no basis upon which it could be said that
    Romandale was deprived of substantially all of the benefit it contracted for
    under the 2005 August Agreement: <em>Boa-Franc</em> <em>Inc.</em>, at para. 50; <em>Majdpour v. M&amp;B Acquisition Corp.</em> (2001), 206 D.L.R. (4th) 627
    (Ont. C.A.), at para. 31; <em>Hunter Engineering Co. v. Syncrude Canada Ltd.</em>,
    [1989] 1 S.C.R. 426, at p. 499, <em>per </em>Wilson J.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[402]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the submissions
    of Romandale and the trial judges determination, Kerbel did not repudiate the
    2005 August Agreement by entering into the Settlement Agreement, largely
    because much of the 2005 August Agreement had been performed to the benefit of
    both parties. It is simply too late for the proverbial egg to be unscrambled.
    It is too late for repudiation to play a useful role in analyzing the
    contractual relationships between Romandale and Kerbel. </p>
