  <p class=Onappealfrom><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the conviction entered on
    April 24, 2019, by Justice Wayne G. Rabley of the Ontario Court of Justice, and
    from the sentence imposed on August 28, 2019, with reasons reported at 2019
    ONCJ 626.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Harvison Young J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Garrett Gauthier was charged with accessing,
    possessing, making available, and making child pornography. He was convicted on
    all four counts. He appeals his convictions on several grounds, including that
    the trial judge misapprehended potentially exculpatory evidence related to
    Skype syncing. He also seeks leave to appeal his sentence. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant came to the attention of police
    when they received a tip from the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited
    Children (NCMEC), stating that an image of child pornography had been uploaded
    to Skype from his IP address by an account called “dave.j.dunham” on January
    30, 2017. The police traced the IP address to Mr. Gauthier’s home. They
    searched the home and seized Mr. Gauthier’s phone and laptop. They found 18
    images on his laptop and 121 images and 3 videos on his phone. The police also
    found records of graphic Skype chats which formed the basis of the making child
    pornography charge. There was no dispute that the materials, including the chat
    messages, were child pornography. The issue at trial was identity: did the
    Crown prove that the appellant put the material on his devices?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The case against the appellant was
    circumstantial. The appellant lives with his partner, and at least one other
    person had lived with them in the few years prior to the charges. Neither his
    computer nor his cell phone were password protected. The evidence for the Crown
    rested on a post-arrest interview with the appellant; the evidence of Det.
    Sandor Illes, an internet child exploitation investigator with the Waterloo
    Regional Police Service; and the evidence of Det. Allison Laing, a retired
    computer forensic examiner with the Waterloo Regional Police Service. Det.
    Laing was qualified as an expert, although, due to certain procedural
    irregularities discussed below, the basis for her qualification and the scope
    of her expertise was confused.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the Crown sought to prove that only
    the appellant could have been responsible for the dave.j.dunham Skype activity
    and that the appellant possessed the contraband files on his devices. The
    defence attempted to raise a reasonable doubt by relying on evidence (a) that
    another person using a separate device could have been responsible for the
    evidence of illegal activity on the appellant's devices and (b) that the
    appellant was unlikely to have engaged in the illegal  activity due to his
    presence in public places or proximity to other people at the time it occurred.
    To highlight the absence of exclusive opportunity, counsel pointed to the
    possibility of someone else's involvement but did not bring a formal
    third-party suspect application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The specific grounds of appeal raised by the
    appellant are based on two underlying and related arguments. The first is that
    as a case about the possession and creation of digital contraband, much of the
    evidence was complex and highly technical, describing subjects like the
    automatic sending and syncing of media files, the ability of a Skype user to
    sync data across devices, the probative value of a router’s MAC address,
    falsifiability, and more. Some of this evidence was inadmissible to begin with
    and had the effect of obscuring gaps in the Crown’s offer of proof.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the trial judge made a premature finding
    that the appellant had the exclusive opportunity to commit the offences, which
    drove his reasoning throughout the rest of his analysis. He was driven to this
    by his error in applying the third-party suspect test, which, as both parties
    agree, had not been argued. This, in the appellant’s view, effectively reversed
    the burden of proof. Having concluded at an early juncture that the appellant
    had an exclusive opportunity to commit the offences, the trial judge failed to
    fairly assess the appellant’s denial. Rather, the evidence about the
    appellant’s whereabouts and the absence of exclusive opportunity should have
    been part of the totality of the evidence the trial judge considered in his decision
    on whether the Crown’s offer of proof on each charge precluded any reasonable
    innocent explanation: <em>R. v. Villaroman</em>, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R.
    1000. Instead, he was left with no alternative but to reject or minimize
    evidence that was inconsistent with the inference of guilt he had already
    drawn.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent submits that the trial judge
    understood the Skype syncing evidence and properly rejected the argument that
    the syncing could have been remotely effected. The respondent also submits
    that, while the case for the Crown was circumstantial, the only real issue was
    whether the appellant was the user of the Skype “dave.j.dunham” account found
    on his cell phone and laptop, and the evidence supporting this was
    overwhelming. This evidence included the fact that dave.j.dunham’s chat records
    included a number of biographical details that were consistent with the
    appellant. In addition, “Dunham” was Mr. Gauthier’s mother’s maiden name. The
    evidence of the expert was properly admitted and within her scope and
    expertise. The trial judge did not reverse the burden of proof or misapprehend
    the evidence. Even if there were errors, the circumstantial case was so
    overwhelming that the convictions should stand. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the following reasons, I would allow the
    appeal and order a new trial with respect to the accessing, making available, and
    making counts, and an acquittal with respect to the possession count. I will
    address the grounds of appeal in turn.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The decision below</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After giving a brief overview of the facts, the
    trial judge discussed the legal principles involved. He directed himself on the
    principles set out in <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. In addition,
    he stated that the defence had “submitted that an alternative suspect, a former
    roommate” could have committed the offences. As a result, he determined that
    the test for a third-party suspect in <em>R. v. Grandinetti</em>, 2005 SCC 5,
    [2005] 1 S.C.R. 27, and <em>R. v. Grant</em>, 2015 SCC 9, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 475, applied.
    He did not discuss the <em>Villaroman </em>case in his reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge summarized the defence as
    resting upon the following five “pillars”:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant did not have exclusive opportunity
    to access, possess or distribute the child pornography on the two devices;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The emails that he provided as exhibits could
    only have been produced at his place of employment and therefore establish that
    he was at work and not at home on January 30;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The cell phone records provide evidence that he
    was in his office making calls and therefore not at home on January 30;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He was in public settings when the majority of
    the other downloads were made and therefore could not and would not have been
    using his cell phone or laptop during those times; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He is a credible witness who should be believed
    or at least his evidence should raise a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After rejecting each pillar of the defence, the
    trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven its case beyond a reasonable
    doubt: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Given the evidence
    presented by the Crown and in particular the testimony of Detectives Laing and
    Illes, I find that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Garrett
    Gauthier is one and the same person as david.j.dunham. Even though this is a
    circumstantial case, I cannot come to any other [rational] conclusion other
    than that Mr. Gauthier committed these offences.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Issues on appeal</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant raises four arguments on his
    conviction appeal which I will consider in turn:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><a
name="_Hlk62810558"></a><a name="_Hlk62833506"><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge relied on inadmissible evidence from the Crown’s
    expert about the functioning of Skype technology, or alternatively, failed to
    properly consider and limit the scope of her evidence;</span></a></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge applied the wrong legal test and reversed the burden
    of proof;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge misapprehended the evidence of identity and
    opportunity; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s verdict on the possession charge was unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On his appeal of his four-year concurrent
    sentences on the possessing and making available counts, the appellant submits
    that the trial judge committed errors in principle and that the resulting
    sentences were disproportionate, harsh, and excessive.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Analysis</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Inadmissible evidence on the functioning of
    Skype technology</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the appellant, the trial judge
    erred in admitting Det. Laing’s evidence as an expert witness, because she was
    insufficiently independent of the investigation and because key parts of her
    evidence exceeded the scope of her expertise. This second error was compounded
    by a failure to define and or limit the scope of her evidence to her expertise,
    which set the groundwork for further errors in the approach to and
    consideration of the evidence at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent, on the other hand, takes the
    position that Det. Laing’s evidence was properly admitted and that the trial
    judge did not err in reversing his earlier ruling that she was not sufficiently
    independent of the investigation. There was no issue with the scope of Det.
    Laing’s evidence; rather it was well understood. She was permitted to give both
    expert opinion evidence and technical fact evidence based on her specialized
    knowledge in the area of “computer examination, data analysis, computer and
    cell phone forensic analysis and data retrieval.” Moreover, the Crown submits,
    her evidence was within the scope of this specialized knowledge and expertise.
    To the extent she provided evidence about the operation of Skype, this evidence
    was largely elicited by the defence and benefited the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial began with a <em>voir dire </em>on the
    qualifications of the Crown’s expert, Det. Laing. The Crown initially sought to
    qualify her as an expert to “provide evidence <a name="_Hlk63000472">relative
    to computer examination, data analysis, computer, and cell phone forensic

    surrounding her contact with Det. Illes and the investigative team. The trial
    judge based his independence conclusion on the finding that Det. Laing had
    discussed the investigation with Det. Illes and seen his work product and
    conclusion that the appellant was dave.j.dunham in May 2017 before she

    giving evidence within her expertise because she was giving evidence about the
    forensic analysis and data retrieval and not about Skype’s functioning. With
    respect, given the fact that the heart of the defence was that the appellant
    had not personally uploaded any contraband or operated the dave.j.dunham
    account during the material times, the issue of remote uploading and syncing
    across devices with the same Skype account was a live issue. As the Crown notes,
    the syncing function was key to the appellant’s defence. The very general basis
    for Det. Laing’s expertise – “computer examination, data analysis, computer and
    cell phone forensic analysis and data retrieval” – says nothing about social
    media platforms and, in particular, Skype. Det. Laing, by her own admission,
    was not an expert in Skype. </span></p>

    trial judge did not err in declining to exclude Det. Laing’s evidence on the
    basis that she lacked independence, he erred in failing to limit the scope of her
    evidence in relation to Skype. In the circumstances of this case, I am unable
    to conclude that the case against the appellant was so overwhelming that
    conviction was inevitable in the absence of this evidence. Although that
    disposes of the appeal, I will address the other grounds because they were
    fully argued before us in the course of the appeal.</span></p>

    that someone else was responsible for the illegal activity. This person had
    access to the appellant’s devices, which were not password protected, at some
    point in the past and logged on to the dave.j.dunham Skype account during this
    time. As a result, the photos and videos were synced onto the appellant’s
    devices via<em> </em>Skype. The implication of this defence is that the person

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In order for a

    between the third party and the crime. As stated by Karakatsanis J. in R. v.

    the means, or the propensity to commit the crime will often establish this

lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is common ground that the trial judge
    mistakenly referred to the <em>Grandinetti</em> test when the <em>Villaroman</em> analytical framework applies. The Crown, however, argues that this was of no
    moment because the trial judge actually applied the <em>Villaroman</em> test.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence sought to raise a doubt by
    identifying reasonable inferences inconsistent with guilt and evidence capable
    of undermining the Crown’s claim of exclusive opportunity. In making the
    argument, the defence emphasized its position that there was a reasonable
    possibility that Mr. Collins or others were implicated in the illegal activity.
    The defence did not suggest that Mr. Collins had a motive or propensity to
    commit the crime. It was understood that counsel was not advancing a
    third-party suspect defence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, the appellant argues that applying
    the <em>Grandinetti</em> framework effectively reversed the burden of proof
    because applying the <em>Grandinetti</em> test limited, from the outset of the
    analysis, the range of potentially innocent explanations for the evidence of
    illegal activity on the appellant’s devices, while the <em>Villaroman</em> test
    precludes conviction on circumstantial evidence if there is another reasonable
    explanation inconsistent with guilt. This court has allowed appeals from
    conviction in cases where the trial judge has misunderstood the approach to
    circumstantial evidence and implicitly required the defendant to explain what
    happened. This is reinforced by the trial judge’s statement in the course of
    his explanation for rejecting the appellant’s evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I appreciate that
    the Defence bears no onus to prove the innocence of Mr. Gauthier and that the
    onus of proof always rests with the Crown, but in my view, much of this
    evidence was problematic for the reasons I have set out and I find that it did
    not exonerate Mr. Gauthier as suggested by the Defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent submits that, when the reasons
    are read as a whole, the trial judge did apply the <em>Villaroman</em> framework. Deference is owed to the trial judge’s conclusion that there is no
    reasonable alternative inference to guilt. The trial judge’s reference to the
    third-party suspect test is of no moment and, if it was an error, it was a
    harmless one. Although he cited the <em>Grandinetti</em> “air of reality” test
    at the outset, the trial judge did not mention it again in his reasons. He
    considered all of the evidence, including the defence evidence, and eventually
    found that the only rational conclusion was that the appellant committed the
    offence. Although his use of the word “exonerate” is not perfect, when the
    reasons are read as a whole, it is clear that the trial judge properly applied
    the burden of proof. The trial judge concluded his analysis with the statement
    that he found that “the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that
    neither Mr. Collins, Mr. Alexander nor a person unknown were operating the
    account david.j.dunham Skype account. By process of elimination, that leaves
    only Mr. Gauthier.”</span></p>

    is that, in cases resting upon circumstantial evidence, the trier of fact
    should consider other reasonable inferences inconsistent with guilt: <em>Villaroman</em>,
    at para. 37. This is because of the danger that a trier of fact may fill in the

    and justify serious consideration. This set the stage for the risk of an
    improper shifting of the burden of proof to the accused because, once the trial

    judge found that the dave.j.dunham account had been created in order to
    disguise the identity of the real user. Given that Dunham was Mr. Gauthier’s

    2012, over two years before Mr. Collins began living with Mr. Alexander and the
    appellant. The chat records in evidence for the dave.j.dunham account dated
    back to November 2, 2015. The appellant had a Skype account that was set up in
    his own name in April 2010. This account had last been logged on to on November

    aware that the Crown had to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. He
    correctly articulated the three steps of <em>W.(D.)</em> and applied those
    steps. He rejected the appellant’s evidence, finding it inconsistent and

    suspect framework at the outset set the stage for an unfair assessment of the <em>Villaroman</em> test which appeared to place an unfair burden on the appellant. This concern
    was exacerbated by the trial judge’s comment that the evidence did not
    “exonerate” the appellant.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When will a misapprehension of the evidence
    render a trial unfair and result in a miscarriage of justice? The nature and
    extent of the misapprehension and its significance to the trial judge's verdict
    must be considered in light of the fundamental requirement that a verdict must
    be based exclusively on the evidence adduced at trial. Where a trial judge is
    mistaken as to the substance of material parts of the evidence and those errors
    play an essential part in the reasoning process resulting in a conviction, then,
    in my view, the accused's conviction is not based exclusively on the evidence
    and is not a &quot;true&quot; verdict. Convictions resting on a misapprehension
    of the substance of the evidence adduced at trial sit on no firmer foundation
    than those based on information derived from sources extraneous to the trial.
    If an appellant can demonstrate that the conviction depends on a
    misapprehension of the evidence then, in my view, it must follow that the
    appellant has not received a fair trial, and was the victim of a miscarriage of
    justice. This is so even if the evidence, as actually adduced at trial, was
    capable of supporting a conviction.</span></p>

    misapprehension of the evidence before him. He assumed that the upload on
    January 30 had to have happened from the appellant’s home. Part of the basis
    for rejecting Mr. Collins as the possible operator of the account was that Mr.
    Collins had moved to Newfoundland, and the trial judge stated that it was
    absurd to suggest that Mr. Collins was the perpetrator:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, it is beyond credulity to suggest
    that Mr. Collins returned from Newfoundland without telling Mr. Gauthier or Mr.
    Alexander and then entered into their home when they were not there and without
    their permission, to access the Skype account and download child pornography
    onto the laptop. That simply defies logic.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span
lang=EN-CA>I should make a finding that Stephen Collins was not there that day</span></span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Having rejected the possibility that there might
    have been other persons involved, this made the appellant’s version of events
    (such as his position that he was at work or in social situations at times when
    the dave.j.dunham account was chatting or when child pornography was accessed)
    presumptively suspect. The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence on
    this issue and found that it did not raise a reasonable doubt. The trial judge
    dismissed this possibility as far-fetched, noting that it was impossible to
    believe that a computer-savvy engineer such as the appellant would not have
    noticed that his Skype application had effectively been used by someone else
    for a few years. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence on this point. The evidence elicited by both the
    Crown and the defence was that information on Skype could be synced across
    devices. The trial judge’s assumption that the January 30 upload originated
    from the appellant’s home disregarded this evidence. This caused him to
    overlook a reasonable innocent explanation for the inculpatory evidence on the
    appellant’s devices.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown argues that the trial judge’s finding
    that the upload happened at Mr. Gauthier’s home was supported by the evidence. For
    example, the Crown states that someone must have logged in to Skype on the
    appellant’s computer in the appellant’s home on January 30 for the images to
    have synced. In addition, the Crown argues that evidence related to IP and MAC
    addresses supports the trial judge’s finding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, it is not clear from Det. Laing’s
    testimony that this evidence supports the inference that the January 30 upload
    happened in the appellant’s home. First, the Skype settings do not suggest that
    someone had to have been at the appellant’s computer on January 30. As Det.
    Laing testified, Skype technology syncs across devices. However, all that is
    required is that Skype be open and logged in. Nothing in Det. Laing’s testimony
    on the Skype settings, including the fact that Skype was not set to start upon
    start-up, suggests that someone had to open and log in to Skype on January 30.
    Second, Det. Laing’s evidence related to the IP address and MAC address
    associated with the laptop only suggests that the laptop was at the appellant’s
    home and connected to the internet on January 30. This evidence does not say
    anything about whether the January 30 upload originated from the appellant’s
    laptop or whether it originated from another device. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The only evidence on the record that would
    support the conclusion that the upload happened from the appellant’s home was
    the NCMEC tip and Det. Laing’s evidence that there would be different file
    paths that would enable her to identify which device an upload originated from.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The NCMEC tip cannot be relied on as evidence in
    this case. First, it was hearsay and there was no argument at trial that it
    should be admitted on the basis of any exception to the hearsay rule or the
    principled exception. Second, there was no evidence, aside from Det. Laing’s,
    about whether Skype or NCMEC would be able to differentiate between the
    original upload and a remotely synced download. This is not something that
    could form the basis of judicial notice, particularly during this period of
    rapidly developing and highly complex computer technology.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Det. Laing’s evidence on this point was
    equivocal and confusing and given her admitted lack of expertise on Skype syncing
    as discussed above, inadmissible. She began her answer with the statement that
    she had not tested this theory, but that she thought that there would be
    different file paths that would allow her to identify where an upload
    originated. The fact that even Det. Laing was unsure about this subject
    underlines the extent to which this area is “beyond the ken” of fact finders. By
    disregarding (without discussing) the possibility of remote access by someone
    who had access to the appellant’s devices some time ago, it is not clear that
    the trial judge understood that this could have been a technical possibility.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge made a number of findings that
    allowed him to conclude that the appellant was the operator of the dave.j.dunham
    Skype account. He found that the dave.j.dunham Skype account was created on the
    appellant’s laptop, and not on some other device. He drew this inference
    because the corresponding email address (dave.j.dunham@gmail.com), which was
    not used for any purpose other than to create the dave.j.dunham Skype account,
    was logged in on the appellant’s computer. He found it illogical to suggest
    that someone would have logged in to that email account on the appellant’s
    computer some time after the creation of the Skype account. He also found that
    there was powerful circumstantial evidence that the appellant was the operator
    of the dave.j.dunham Skype account, including that a number of biographical
    details that dave.j.dunham had discussed in Skype chats also described the appellant.
    It is possible that the sum total of this evidence would have enabled a trier
    of fact to draw the inference that the appellant was the operator of the dave.j.dunham
    Skype account. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the trial judge’s unstated assumption
    that the January 30 upload originated in the appellant’s home was not supported
    by any admissible evidence at trial and was a misapprehension of the evidence.
    This assumption played an essential part in his train of reasoning. It was one
    of the reasons that the trial judge concluded that Mr. Collins could not have
    committed the offences. Having so concluded, the trial judge viewed the
    appellant’s potentially exculpatory evidence with a great deal of skepticism. As
    a result, there was a miscarriage of justice. </span></p>

    possession was unreasonable on the evidence. All but two of the files

    cache folders is only enough to establish accessing, not possession. </span></p>

    her expertise. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that, because the trial

    is not enough evidence capable of supporting a conviction on possession. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown concedes that the evidence with

    the Crown states that possession of the written pornography in Skype chat logs
    is sufficient to ground a conviction for possession of child pornography.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When asked, Det. Laing first testified that a
    user would have to do something to accept a download before a file would appear
    in the folder:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A.      In
    the, “My Skype’s received files,” this is a default location that Skype has for
    file transfers and download, it’s the download location. The user can, in the
    settings for Skype, change where those files would be downloaded and saved.
    This is still set to the default location as, “My Skype received files.” When
    the file is, file transfer is accepted by the user, this is the directory the
    file is saved to by the computer.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q.      All
    right, so when someone is in Skype, just describe for us what’s happening in
    Skype with the user that, that results in these two particular images winding
    up in that received files sub-folder.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A.      The user has
    accepted a file transfer from another Skype user and it’s being downloaded into
    this location.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Later, in cross-examination, Det. Laing denied
    that “accepted” had any meaning in relation to file transfers:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q.      You
    have indicated to us a number of different instances where what you can say is
    an image appears to have been accessed, that’s as opposed to being accepted.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q.      Well,
    accepted as in – well, I don’t know if the right term would be downloaded,

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Crown counsel]:   The file transfer you’re

    the world of file transfers from your standpoint?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A.      Not, I’m not recognizing that, no.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although her initial testimony suggests that a
    Skype user would have knowledge of the contents of the Skype received files
    folder, by virtue of the fact that a received file would have to be “accepted”,
    her later statement that “accept” had no meaning raises questions about what
    user action was required for documents to end up in the Skype folder. That, in
    turn, raises questions about whether a user would have knowledge of the
    contents of the folder or whether files could end up in the folder
    automatically, without the knowledge of the computer user. Det. Laing’s
    evidence on the mechanics of the Skype folder is even more questionable given
    that she, by her own admission, was not an expert in Skype technology.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Considered as a whole, her evidence does not clearly
    establish that the appellant deliberately “accepted” the files and therefore
    had the requisite knowledge to establish possession. Moreover, as I have
    already outlined, her evidence as to the functioning of Skype was inadmissible
    because she recognized that she did not know how it worked. Without this
    evidence, there was no evidence that the appellant knew that he had physical
    custody of the images. Knowledge of possession is an essential element of
    possession: <em>R. v.</em> <em>Morelli</em>, 2010 SCC 8, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 253, at
    para. 16; <em>R. v. M.N.</em>, 2017 ONCA 434, at para. 37. There was no other

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I reject the Crown’s argument that possession of
    the Skype chats would be enough to sustain the possession conviction. First, my
    conclusions on the other grounds of appeal apply to the Skype chats as well.
    Second, this theory of liability was not advanced at trial, nor was it
    specified on the information. The information stated that the possession charge
    was based on “digital images and videos”, not written material. I would not
    amend the information to include the written material in the possession count,
    as suggested by the Crown in oral argument. I am not persuaded that doing so at
    this stage would not occasion prejudice to the appellant.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I disagree. While the circumstantial evidence
    may have appeared to be strong, it was not overwhelming. The heart of the defence
    was the argument that the contraband on the appellant’s devices could have been
    remotely transferred. Much of the expert evidence on that subject was
    inadmissible as it was beyond, on Det. Laing’s own admission, the scope of her expertise.
    Without Det. Laing’s evidence on key aspects of the technology, including
    whether the January 30 upload happened from the appellant’s home and how the
    files ended up on the devices (which was essential to the possession
    conviction), it cannot be said that <a name="_Hlk67990108">the case against the
    appellant was so overwhelming that conviction was inevitable</a>. Given the
    confusion around the third-party suspect <em>Grandinetti</em> test and the
    circumstantial evidence test in <em>Villaroman</em>, as well as the fact that,
    as set out above, the inadmissible evidence of Det. Laing played a significant
    role in the trial judge’s decision, I am unable to reach that conclusion. That
    said, it is possible that the circumstantial case could have given rise to a
    conviction in the absence of these errors. For that reason, I would allow the
    appeal and order a new trial with respect to the accessing, making available,
    and making child pornography counts. I would order that an acquittal be entered
    with respect to the possession count as there was no admissible evidence that
