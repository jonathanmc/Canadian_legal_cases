  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s wife operated a daycare in their
    home. The appellant was charged with seven counts of sexual offences in
    relation to two complainants who attended the daycare. The events giving rise
    to the charges took place between 2004 and 2010 in connection with the
    complainant “J.R.” and between 2005 and 2008 for the complainant “S.L”. Both
    complainants attended the daycare. The trial judge convicted the appellant on
    one count of sexual interference and one count of sexual assault in relation to
    J.R. and entered acquittals on the other two charges in relation to J.R. and
    all three in connection with S.L. The sexual assault charge was conditionally
    stayed pursuant to <em>Kienapple v. The Queen</em>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. The
    appellant appeals his sexual interference conviction, alleging a faulty
    credibility analysis by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In a videotaped interview, admitted at trial
    under s. 715.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> without objection, J.R. stated
    that on one occasion the appellant forced her to fellate him. He was convicted
    of the incident which occurred in the “backroom” which was also a laundry room.
    In total, she stated that the assaults happened anywhere from 2 to 20 times. She
    said that after assaulting her he would usually sit naked on the couch and watch
    television for half an hour. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant denied all the allegations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found it “highly improbable”
    that the appellant would sit naked on the couch after assaulting J.R. but
    believed her evidence about the backroom incident. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge
    incorrectly approached the credibility analysis as a contest between his
    evidence and that of J.R. He points to two comments made by the trial judge:
    (i) that the appellant’s evidence was “stacked against” J.R.’s; and (ii) that
    the evidence of the appellant was “weighed against” that of J.R.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not agree. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the impugned comments should not be
    extracted from the words surrounding them. The entire paragraphs are as follows.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to “stacked against”:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When Mr. Freamo’s
    denial is stacked against J.R.’s evidence that there was an occasion when Mr.
    Freamo put his penis in her mouth, I am satisfied that J.R.’s evidence is
    sufficient to displace the presumption of innocence, and&nbsp;</span><span
class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>I am not left in a state of reasonable doubt
    that Mr. Freamo committed the offence of sexual interference pursuant to s. 151
    of the Criminal Code. I found J.R.’s evidence of the other incidents to be less
    certain.</span></span><span lang=EN-CA> For example, during the police
    interview when J.R. referred to an incident when she says Mr. Freamo asked her
    to touch herself, the recording is unclear. The interviewer referred to her
    vagina but there was no unequivocal confirmation by J.R. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to “weighed against”:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I am not prepared
    to find that the rejection of this piece of evidence makes the rest of J.R.’s
    evidence unreliable or untrustworthy. J.R. was very specific in recalling an
    incident that involved Mr. Freamo putting his penis in her mouth. She seems
    certain that it was Mr. Freamo who did this. <span class=Underline>I accept
    this evidence.</span> I have weighed the evidence of J.R. against the evidence
    of Mr. Freamo. I<span class=Underline>&nbsp;acknowledge that Mr. Freamo’s
    defence is a general denial and it must necessarily be lacking in detail. I am
    also cognizant that as I mentioned before, proof of guilt beyond a reasonable
    doubt requires more than a credibility contest.</span> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s statements following the
    impugned language demonstrates a correct understanding and application of the
    burden of proof. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, these words must also be considered in
    the context of the reasons as a whole. The trial judge repeatedly correctly
    instructed himself on the proper approach to a credibility analysis. He considered
    the counts individually. He explained why he had doubts on some of the counts.
    For example, he explained that he had a reasonable doubt on J.R.’s evidence
    with respect to the fact that the appellant told her to touch herself, because
    the recording of her police interview was ambiguous on those other counts, and
    there was no follow-up by Crown counsel during J.R.’s in-court testimony. He
    further explained why his doubt on some of her statements did not undermine his
    belief on the backroom incident. He acquitted on all of the counts with respect
    to S.L. The trial judge applied a correct approach to the credibility analysis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also submits that the trial
    judge’s doubt about the allegation that the appellant sat naked on the couch is
    inconsistent with his belief about the backroom incident. The appellant says
    that all the trial judge said was that the couch incidents were “highly
    improbable” and more was required to explain the inconsistency. Again, we do
    not agree. The trial judge discussed this with defence counsel during
    submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]hat just sounds
    [like] completely illogical behaviour that is so risky that it would defy
    credulity that he would be sitting for long periods of his time naked on [the]
    couch and when we know that his teenage son and daughter reside there, his wife
    resides there … that undermines the credibility and reliability of [J.R.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then put this to Crown counsel:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>You may agree that
    it is improbable that the assailant would sit naked on the couch in the living
    room where the T.V. is for half an hour or so after the incident. It strikes me
    as improbable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the fact that J.R.
    was not believed about the sitting naked on the couch should have formed part
    of his credibility analysis with respect to the backroom. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge clearly had a reasonable doubt
    about the evidence with respect to sitting naked on the couch. However, he
    believed the evidence regarding the backroom incident. This does not reflect an
    inconsistency. On the contrary, it reflects an intention to assess the evidence
    carefully. This – together with the acquittals – provides additional confidence
