    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, appointing counsel to
    assist him with his application for leave to appeal, and if leave be granted, his
    appeal. The Crown opposes. Moreover, the Crown asks that I decide whether the
    applicant should be granted leave at this time and refuse leave.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant’s trial in the Ontario Court of
    Justice proceeded by way of summary conviction proceeding. After a five-day
    trial, the applicant was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to 18
    month’s custody. He appealed, arguing that the trial judge erred in his
    application of <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, and provided
    insufficient reasons. The summary conviction appeal court judge dismissed his
    appeal. </span></p>

    appeal to this court. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant was represented by counsel of his
    choice before the trial judge and the summary conviction appeal court judge.
    However, he has not worked since being released on parole. His only income
    consists of Ontario Works and government pandemic relief in the form of CERB
    payments, which barely cover his living expenses. His evidence is that he has
    no other funds or assets. </span></p>

    legal aid coverage for an appeal to this court on the basis that his appeal did
    not have sufficient merit to justify giving him a legal aid certificate. Its

lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 684(1) provides that a judge of this
    court may assign counsel to act on behalf of an accused where, in the opinion
    of the judge, it appears desirable in the interests of justice that the accused
    should have legal assistance and where it appears that the accused has not
    sufficient means to obtain that assistance. An order for government-funded counsel
    is exceptional relief: <em>R. v. Staples</em>, 2016 ONCA 362, 352 O.A.C. 392,

    conviction appeal court’s decision is required and an appeal may only be taken
    on any ground that involves a question of law alone: s. 839(1) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. Leave to appeal is granted sparingly: <em>R. v. R.R.</em>, 2008 ONCA
    497, 90 O.R. (3d) 641, at para. 37. There are two circumstances in which leave
    is granted: <em>R.R.</em> at paras. 32, 37:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the merits of the proposed questions of law
    are arguable, even if not strong, and the proposed question of law has
    significance to the administration of justice that goes beyond the particular
    case; or</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When there appears to be a “clear” error even if
    it cannot be said that the error has significance to the administration of
    justice beyond the particular case, especially if the convictions in issue are
    serious and the applicant is facing a significant deprivation of his liberty. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected and was not left in
    reasonable doubt by the applicant’s evidence that no sexual contact whatsoever
    occurred when the complainant was at his apartment. The complainant testified
    that she had only one drink before going to the applicant’s apartment, but
    became very intoxicated and there were gaps in her memory. However, she was
    clear that that the applicant had sexual intercourse with her, without her
    consent. The trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the applicant says this appeal
    raises questions of law that have significance to the administration of justice
    that go beyond this case. In particular, (1) how should a trial judge assess
    the credibility of a complainant who says she was intoxicated to the point of
    having gaps in her memory after only one drink, and (2) how should the
    reliability of the evidence of a complainant who is intoxicated be assessed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The reasons of the summary conviction appeal
    court judge, the notice of appeal to this court, and the opinion letter to
    Legal Aid Ontario by the applicant’s trial and summary conviction appeal court
    counsel provide a framework for the  grounds on which the applicant will seek
    leave and, if leave be granted, appeal. Further, the applicant has a university
    education. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I am of the view that the issues that the
    applicant seeks leave to pursue on this second appeal are relatively
    straightforward and that a panel of this court can fairly and properly assess
    whether the proposed appeal satisfies the test for leave, and, if leave be
    granted, can fairly and properly deal with the appeal without the assignment of
    counsel to act on his behalf. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I reject the Crown’s request that I decide, and
    refuse, the applicant’s leave application at this time. The Crown correctly
    notes that s. 839(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> provides that an appeal to
    this court of a summary conviction matter may be taken on any ground that
    involves a question of law alone with the leave of this court “or a judge
    thereof”. However, r. 7.3.6(9) of the court’s Criminal Appeals Practice
    Direction, concerning the procedure on applications for leave to appeal in
    summary conviction appeals, provides as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Within 30 days of receipt of all
    materials relating to the appeal, the materials shall be forwarded to a panel
    of the court assigned to hear criminal appeals during the week the materials
    are forwarded. The panel shall decide whether to grant or to refuse leave to
    appeal based on the written material without the attendance of counsel and
    cause the parties to be notified of their decision. The court will generally
    not provide reasons granting or refusing leave to appeal.</span></p>
