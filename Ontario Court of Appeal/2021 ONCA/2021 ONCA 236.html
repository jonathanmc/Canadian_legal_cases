  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>R.H. appeals from sentences totaling six years,
    imposed following his guilty pleas to sexual interference, making child
    pornography and accessing child pornography. He was sentenced to prison terms
    of five years, one year consecutive, and one year concurrent, respectively. The
    sentencing judge also imposed a number of ancillary orders, including a
    lifetime prohibition order under s. 161(1) which, among several other things,
    forbids the appellant from accessing the internet except in accordance with
    conditions set by the court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits on appeal that the
    sentences were too harsh. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant sexually abused C.S. for years,
    beginning when C.S. was only ten years old. The appellant was 35 years senior
    and there was a family connection: he was a cousin of C.S.’s stepfather. The
    appellant began by taking C.S. on short overnight trips where they would wake
    up in the same bed with their hands on each other’s intimate body parts. Oral
    and anal intercourse later began. They would meet each other every 1-3 months. A
    system of penalties was established. If the complainant did not communicate
    with the appellant every day, he would have to atone for it by performing
    sexual acts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> The appellant submits that the sentencing judge </span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>erred</span><span lang=EN-CA> by concluding that the appellant created the penalty regime. It is of no moment
    to the sentence whether the appellant created this or merely participated in
    it. Other factual concerns raised by the appellant were also immaterial to the
    sentence imposed, which was at the lower end of the appropriate range,
    reflecting the appellant’s guilty pleas. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The offences came to light in 2018 when C.S.’s
    girlfriend, S.L. learned of the abuse. She initially pretended to be C.S. and
    would communicate with the appellant as was expected. She offered to take
    C.S.’s place and sent the appellant some unclothed pictures of her. Finally, S.L.
    went to a police station to complain that the appellant was threatening her and
    C.S. The police executed a search warrant at the appellant’s apartment and
    found nude pictures of both C.S. and S.L.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the sentencing hearing, the Crown sought a nine-year
    sentence. The defence suggested 3-4 years, arguing that the appropriate range
    was 3-5 years, and that the lower range was fit because of the guilty pleas. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge was guided by <em>R. v. D.(D.)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> (2002),</span></em> 58 OR (3d) 788 (C.A.), holding
    that the appropriate sentence range where the offender is in a position of
    trust and sexually abuses children on a regular basis over substantial periods
    of time should be mid-to-upper-single-digit penitentiary terms.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The aggravating factors included the abuse of
    children under 18 years of age, abuse of a position of authority or trust in
    relation to C.S., grooming C.S. starting at the age of 10, the escalation of
    the nature of the sexual abuse towards C.S., the large number of incidents,
    multiple victims, the severe impact on the complainants, the control exercised
    over C.S., and the tendency of the appellant to blame C.S. for the sexual
    contact. Both complainants inflicted self-harm as a result of the abuse. C.S.
    had suicidal thoughts and on several occasions fashioned nooses in his room
    with that purpose in mind. He suffered from severe depression as a result of
    the abuse. Both S.L. and C.S. suffered damage to their relationships with
    family and friends. The sentencing judge concluded that the sexual abuse had “a
    significant and serious impact on their emotional well-being and development.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The mitigating circumstances included the
    absence of any criminal record, the guilty pleas, the appellant’s gainful
    employment, and that he was the sole provider for his elderly mother. The
    appellant was 53 years old at the time of sentencing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge concluded that anything
    less than a global six-year sentence would not properly address denunciation
    and deterrence and the need to protect the wellbeing of children. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge’s careful and detailed
    reasons reveal no error in principle in his selection of a six-year global
    sentence and the sentence imposed was fit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted in <em>R. v. Friesen</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2020 SCC 9, 444 D.L.R. (4th) 1, at
    para. 26: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>… an appellate
    court can only intervene to vary a sentence if (1) the sentence is demonstrably
    unfit or (2) the sentencing judge made an error in principle that had an impact
    on the sentence. Errors in principle include an error of law, a failure to
    consider a relevant factor, or erroneous consideration of an aggravating or
    mitigating factor. The weighing or balancing of factors can form an error in
    principle only if by emphasizing one factor or by not giving enough weight to
    another, the trial judge exercises his or her discretion unreasonably. Not
    every error in principle is material: an appellate court can only intervene if
    it is apparent from the trial judge’s reasons that the error had an impact on the
    sentence. If an error in principle had no impact on the sentence, that is the
    end of the error in principle analysis and appellate intervention is justified
    only if the sentence is demonstrably unfit. [Internal quotations and citations omitted.] </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Friesen</em>, the Court held that an
    appellate court was wrong to decrease the six-year sentence imposed by the
    trial judge for child sexual abuse to four-and-a-half years incarceration. In
    doing so, the Court emphasized that denunciation and deterrence must be prioritized
    for offences of sexual offences against children, because of the serious harm
    caused by these crimes and the inherent vulnerability of the victims. The
    sentencing judge’s weighing of the factors is entitled to deference.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Duty counsel, on behalf of the appellant, points
    out that the prohibition order relating to internet use is too broad, having
    regard to this court’s decision in <em>R. v. Brar</em>, 2016 ONCA 724, 134 O.R.
    (3d) 103. The prohibition imposed by the sentencing judge forbids the appellant
    from: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>using the Internet
    or other digital network, unless the offender does so in accordance with the
    conditions set by the court, including but not limited to: any digital medium

    material that meets the definition of pornography and/or obscenity and not to
