    named appellant Enrico Iafolla. He appeals the dismissal of an application for a
    declaration that, as a judgment creditor of the ex-husband of the respondent,
    he is entitled to receive the balance of the proceeds of the sale of a
    matrimonial home. Pursuant to the divorce judgment between the respondent and
    her ex-husband, those funds are to be held as security for his support
    obligations. </span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>As I will explain, the issue here engages the
    court’s fundamental duty to satisfy itself that reasonable arrangements have
    been made for the support of children. I would allow the appeal in part and
    direct the matter back to the trial judge to consider whether a variation of
    the Divorce Judgment is appropriate as a result of the material change in
    circumstances.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN>BACKGROUND </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The respondent Jolanta Lasota and Zlatko Antonov
    were married and have one child. They separated in 2017. It is common ground
    that Antonov has paid no child support, has shown little interest in the child,
    now 11, and did not participate in the divorce proceedings. He made no
    financial disclosure.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>On July 25, 2018, Backhouse J. presided over the
    divorce. Antonov did not appear. She attributed an income to him based on his
    bank deposits and established monthly child and spousal support in the amounts
    of $1,429 and $3,191 respectively. In the Divorce Order, she gave Ms. Lasota
    control over the sale of the jointly held matrimonial home. The net proceeds of
    the sale after paying real estate commissions, legal expenses, tax arrears, and
    the outstanding mortgage were to be divided into two equal shares. From
    Antonov’s share, she ordered that the arrears of child and spousal support then
    owing, plus the equalization payment be deducted. The trial judge further
    ordered at paragraph 19: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The remaining balance
    of [Antonov’s] share of the net proceeds of the sale of the Matrimonial Home,
    if any, shall be held in trust as security for [Antonov’s] future child and
    spousal support obligations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The home was sold in November 2018. It appeared on
    closing that there was a writ of execution registered on title to the home on
    November 28, 2017. The writ relates to a judgment against Antonov for $380,071
    plus costs and interest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The net proceeds of the sale were $594,273.30. It
    was agreed between the appellant and the respondent that, from these proceeds, various
    fees, tax, and mortgage payments would be paid. In addition, the 8 months of
    spousal and child support arrears were paid to the respondent.  The balance of
    Antonov’s share of the proceeds would be placed in trust without prejudice the appellant’s
    right to bring an application to determine who has priority to those funds. The
    amount in issue now is $180,670.15.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>As mentioned, Antonov has made no support payments,
    including pursuant to the Divorce Order. His arrears would now be over $140,000
    and soon will amount to the entire amount being held back from the sale. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN>POSITIONS OF THE
    PARTIES</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN>The appellant</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The appellant’s position is that he is entitled to
    the full amount of $180,670.15 pursuant to his rights under s. 2 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Creditors' Relief Act, 2010</span></em><span lang=EN>, S.O. 2010, c.
    16, Schedule 4 (“</span><em><span lang=EN-CA>CRA</span></em><span lang=EN>”).
    He submits that the Divorce Order should be set aside to the extent that it
    interferes with his rights under the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>CRA</span></em><span
lang=EN>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Section 2 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>CRA</span></em><span
lang=EN> states: </span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>2. (1) Except as otherwise provided in
    this Act, there is no priority among creditors by execution or garnishment
    issued by the Superior Court of Justice, the Family Court of the Superior Court
    of Justice and the Ontario Court of Justice. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>…</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b><span lang=EN>Exception, support or maintenance
    orders</span></b></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>(3) A support or maintenance order has
    the following priority over other judgment debts, other than debts owing to the
    Crown in right of Canada, regardless of when an enforcement process is issued
    or served:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN>1. If the maintenance or support
    order requires periodic payments, the order has priority to the extent of all
    arrears owing under the order at the time of seizure or attachment. </span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN>2. If
    the support or maintenance order requires the payment of a lump sum, the order
    has priority to the extent of any portion of the lump sum that has not been
    paid. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The appellant argues that the effect of this section is to give
    priority to lump sum support orders and periodic payments in arrears only.  Following
    the payment which cleared up arrears to that date, he submits that he is
    entitled to collect on his judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

    Maroukis</span></em><span lang=EN> (1981), 33 O.R. (2d) 661 (C.A.), aff’d
    [1984] 2 S.C.R. 137. In that case, </span><span lang=EN>the trial judge ordered
    that the jointly owned matrimonial home vested with the wife retroactive to the
    date of separation. The trial judge declared that any subsequent executions on
    the property did not affect the wife’s title. On appeal, this court held that
    the trial judge had no jurisdiction to make a retroactive order since the house
    was held in joint tenancy when the executions were filed and “attached to [the
    husband’s] interest in it.” The Supreme Court of Canada agreed with the Court
    of Appeal’s conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Maroukis</span></em><span lang=EN> was followed in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Ferguson v. Ferguson</span></em><span lang=EN>, 116 D.L.R. (4th) 707
    (Ont. Unif. Fam. Ct.), at p. 713, which found that a writ of execution for a
    debt of the husband, filed before the order that the house be sold and proceeds
    divided, “has priority over any claim that the wife has to the husband's net
    proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The respondent submits that the Court has no jurisdiction to vary the
    Divorce Order outside the divorce proceedings. The effect of the order sought
    would be to vary the Divorce Order. Further she submits that the writ and the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>CRA</span></em><span lang=EN> create no substantive right to the
    funds for the applicant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

lang=EN-CA> (2005)</span><span lang=EN>, 20 R.F.L. (6th) 453 (Ont. S.C.J.),
    aff’d 214 O.A.C. 201, where the trial judge distinguished </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Maroukis</span></em><span lang=EN> and </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Ferguson</span></em><span
lang=EN> as cases determined under provincial family law statutes which did not
    permit retroactive orders, whereas the creation of a trust is based on the
    court’s equitable jurisdiction. In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Stevens</span></em><span
lang=EN> a retroactive vesting order was found to prevail over a writ filed by
    a bank. This court agreed that </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Maroukis </span></em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The application judge concluded that the trial judge crafted the
    Divorce Order to create a trust to secure the respondent’s support payments.
    This takes priority over the applicant’s interest which, in any event, is
    simply that of an execution creditor whose interest is subject to “all the
    equities”: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Ontario Development Corp. v. Trustee of
    the Estate of I.C. Suatac Construction Ltd. </span></em><span lang=EN>(1976), 69

    Ontario Inc. v. Fortress Wismer 3-2011 Ltd</span></em><span lang=EN>., 2020

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The application judge relied on </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Stevens</span></em><span
lang=EN>, where Cronk J.A. expressed concern that the bank was pursuing a
    collateral attack on the original vesting order, stating, at para., 21 that
    “the determination of this issue required an evaluation and weighing of the
    equities as between the Bank and Ms. Stevens”. The application judge concluded
    that attempts to vary such orders should be addressed in the original
    proceeding, where the Court may consider the equities between the parties,
    including the scope and purposes of support orders made under the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Divorce Act</span></em><span lang=EN>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[18]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>I have concluded that the application judge erred: (i) in his
    interpretation of the jurisprudence; and (ii) by not addressing the court’s
    duty regarding child support. Consequently, the matter should be returned to
    the trial judge to consider the material change in circumstances.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The application judge relied on </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Stevens</span></em><span
lang=EN> to establish the priority of the respondent’s claim to the proceeds of
    sale. There, the trial judge had determined that a constructive trust operated
    as of the date of separation to vest the matrimonial home in the wife’s name.
    Therefore, the wife had title to the home before the execution was filed. Here,
    the respondent did not have title in the husband’s portion of the sale at the
    time the writ was filed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>However, I do not agree that</span><em><span lang=EN-CA> Maroukis,</span></em><span
lang=EN> relied on by the appellant, assists him. There, a writ of execution
    was filed with the sheriff before the trial judge vested property in the name
    of the wife. On an application to the trial judge to “clarify the judgment” the
    trial judge vested the home in the wife’s name as of the date of separation –
    which pre-dated the writ of execution. This court confirmed the vesting order
    but not the retrospective effect. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal
    confirming that, when property is divided on marriage breakdown, it does not
    vest until the order is made and there is no provision to retroactively vest
    property. The wife’s title was subject to a pre-existing execution filed with
    the sheriff. </span></p>

lang=EN>The situation is different here. The underlying order in </span><em><span

lang=EN>Child support is the right of the child. The </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Divorce Act</span></em><span lang=EN> establishes a child centered
    approach to divorce orders by giving priority to children’s needs. Children are
    not parties to their parents’ divorce. Consequently, the presence of a child in
    divorce proceedings engages special duties for the court to ensure that
    arrangements are made for support.  Section 11(1)(b) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Divorce Act</span></em><span lang=EN> provides that:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>[I]t is the duty of the court...</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN>(b)  to
    satisfy itself that reasonable arrangements have been made for the support of
    any children of the marriage, having regard to the applicable guidelines, and,

lang=EN>The trial judge, in accordance with her duty under s. 11 of the </span><em><span

    the home for future support including support for the child. There is no
    similar duty on the court for property claims between the spouses or for
    spousal support. The trial judge clearly intended to secure the ex-husband’s
    share of the matrimonial home proceeds for the benefit of the child. That is
    why she included paragraph 19 in the Divorce Order.</span></p>

    for two reasons.</span></p>

    the appellant’s writ. Because the declaration sought by the appellant
    effectively eliminates the security the trial judge put in place, the security
    the trial judge would have ordered had she known of the writ would likely have
    been different. For example, she could have considered s. 2(3)(2) of the </span><em><span
