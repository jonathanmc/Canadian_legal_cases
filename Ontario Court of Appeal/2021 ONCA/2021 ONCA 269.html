  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on July 26, 2018 by
    Justice Joseph A. De Filippis of the Ontario Court of Justice, with reasons
    reported at 2018 ONCJ 513.</p>
  <p><strong>Hoy J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault and sexual interference
    with respect to his daughter, C.L., and sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment,
    followed by 3 years’ probation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The abuse occurred while C.L. visited the appellant. C.L. was four years
    old when she first disclosed the abuse and six years old at the time of trial.
    The trial judge admitted three out-of-court statements made by C.L.: two under
    the principled exception to the hearsay rule, and one under s. 715.1 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction, arguing that the trial judge erred
    in admitting the three statements. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to trial, C.L. disclosed the abuse on three separate occasions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, on April 7, 2016, while at a neighbour’s house, she blurted out
    before her mother and the neighbour, unprompted: “daddy ate my patoon” (“the
    first statement”). The undisputed evidence was that in referring to “patoon”,
    C.L. meant vagina. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After this statement, C.L. was unwilling to participate in a police
    interview without her mother, and the police investigation was suspended. The
    police instructed C.L.’s mother not to discuss the allegations with C.L.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, on November 23, 2016, at a play therapy session, in response to
    a short film entitled “My Body Belongs to Me”, in which a young boy describes
    being inappropriately touched by his uncle, C.L. covered her vaginal areas and
    stated: “Yuk, my dad did that to me.” She then described the abuse. Using a
    baby doll, she acted out three different sexual positions: (1) laying on top of
    the appellant, licking his penis; (2) laying on her side while the appellant
    licked her vagina; and (3) laying on her back, while the appellant opened her
    legs and licked her vagina. She made licking noises during this re-enactment.
    She said this occurred “at dad’s house in dad’s bed”. C.L.’s words and gestures
    were recorded by the social worker, who testified at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following this second statement, the police re-opened their
    investigation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 18, 2017, during a videotaped interview by a police officer, C.L. made
    the third statement: “my daddy licked my private parts” and “ate it”. She said
    it happened in his bed, he used his tongue, and it felt “ticklish”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, C.L. testified by video link, from a room adjacent to the courtroom.
    While she was made available for cross-examination — first by video link and
    then, at her request, in the courtroom — C.L. did not want to answer questions
    about the allegations. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The video-recorded statement</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statement
    to police that was recorded on video was admitted under s. 715.1 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. Section 715.1 of the <em>Code</em> permits a video recording of a victim
    or other witness to be admitted if the Crown establishes on a balance of
    probabilities that: (1) the victim or witness was under the age of 18 at the
    time of the offence; (2) the statement was made within a “reasonable time”
    after the alleged offence; (3) the victim or witness describes the acts
    complained of in the statement; and (4) the victim  or witness, while
    testifying, “adopts” the contents of the statement: <em>R. v. P.S.</em>, 2019 ONCA
    637, at para. 12. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in finding that the video recording
    was made within a reasonable time after the alleged offence and that the
    complainant had adopted its contents while testifying. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, the appellant argues that the nine-month delay between the first
    statement and the video recording was unreasonable because: (1) the police
    could have, but did not, make further efforts to obtain a statement from C.L.
    after their first attempt to interview her was unsuccessful; and (2) having
    regard to the evidence that C.L.’s mother did not follow police instructions to
    refrain from speaking to C.L. about the allegations, C.L. may have been
    influenced by her mother prior to the video recording, tainting the accuracy of
    that statement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argues that C.L.’s responses at trial about whether she recalled
    giving the video-recorded statement were equivocal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject these arguments. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge noted that in considering the requirement that the video recording have
    been made within a reasonable time after the alleged offence, the court must
    balance a number of factors, the most important being the reasons for the delay
    and impact on the child’s ability to accurately recall the events in issue: <em>R.
    v. P.S.</em>, (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 120 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 71. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the circumstances and C.L.’s tender age, the trial judge was
    satisfied that the statement was made within a reasonable time. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His
    reasons describe a young child who was scared and uncomfortable talking about
    the abuse. It took time, and therapy, for her to be able to do so. It was not
    until the ninth therapy session, after watching a short movie where a young boy
    talked about good and bad touches and about how he felt on a bad touch by his
    uncle, that C.L. opened up and made her second statement to the social worker.
    The police decision to suspend the investigation at the time they did was not
    unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In concluding
    that the video recording was made within a reasonable time, the trial judge
    also specifically considered, and addressed in his reasons, the appellant’s
    argument that C.L. may have been influenced by her mother. He noted that “It is
    likely that [C.L.’s] mother influenced her decision to speak to the police but
    the video record suggests most of the words spoken are her own and that she is
    able to recall events.” He concluded that the concern about C.L.’s mother’s
    influence on C.L. could be addressed in determining ultimate reliability. There
    is no basis to interfere with that conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the trial judge found that while C.L. was reluctant to watch the video record
    or talk about the allegations, with some prodding she “eventually acknowledged
    “making the movie” and adopted it.” It was not a case of C.L. not recalling the
    statement; “rather, she did not wish to be exposed to it, or discuss it.”  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also noted that certain statements made by C.L. in her trial
    testimony supported the inference that she had listened to the video and did recall
    her prior allegations. In particular, during the video-recorded interview, in
    recounting that the appellant had licked and eaten her patoon, she described
    the appellant as having made a circling motion with his body. At trial, when
    asked if she had told the officer the truth during the interview, she agreed
    and stated, “I couldn’t do the really lay down circle thing that the – I didn’t
    really do the circle thing right” and laid down on the floor.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that C.L. adopted
    her video-recorded statement. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The first two statements</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>A framework</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first two statements were admitted under the principled exception to the
    hearsay rule. Under that exception, an out of court statement may be admitted
    for the truth of its contents if the party tendering it demonstrates, on a
    balance of probabilities, that the statement satisfies the criteria of
    “necessity” and “threshold reliability”: <em>R. v. Khelawon</em>, 2006 SCC 57,
    [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para. 47; <em>R. v. Bradshaw</em>, 2017 SCC 35, [2017]
    1 S.C.R. 865, at para. 23. Even if the trial judge concludes that those
    criteria are satisfied, she has the discretion to exclude it if the prejudicial
    effect outweighs its probative value: <em>Khelawon</em>, at para. 49; <em>Bradshaw</em>,
    at para. 24. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge noted, “threshold reliability” can be established either by
    showing that there are adequate substitutes for the traditional safeguards for
    testing the truth and accuracy of the hearsay evidence (procedural reliability)
    or that there are sufficient circumstantial or evidentiary guarantees that the
    statement is inherently trustworthy (substantive reliability): <em>Khelawon</em>,
    at paras. 61-63; <em>Bradshaw</em>, at paras. 27-28, 30-31. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    statement must be sufficiently reliable to overcome the dangers arising from
    the difficulty in testing it: <em>Khelawon</em>, at para. 49; <em>Bradshaw</em>,
    at paras. 26, 32. As <em>Bradshaw</em> explains, “…[s]ubstantive reliability is
    concerned with whether the circumstances and any corroborative evidence provide
    a rational basis to reject alternative explanations for the statement, other
    than the declarant’s truthfulness or accuracy”: at para. 40. Thus, the trial
    judge must identify alternative, even speculative, explanations for the hearsay
    statement and, based on the circumstances and evidence led on <em>voir dire</em>,
    must be able to rule out any plausible explanation on a balance of
    probabilities: <em>Bradshaw</em>, at paras. 48, 49. The circumstances in which
    the statement was made and corroborative evidence, if any, must substantially
    negate the possibility that the declarant was untruthful:  <em>Bradshaw</em>,
    at paras. 31, 90. </p>
  <p class=LHeading11>The trial judge’s reasons</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the <em>voir dire</em> with respect to the admissibility of the three
    statements, the trial judge ruled that they were admissible, for reasons to
    follow. The trial judge provided those reasons at the beginning of his reasons
    for judgment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Citing <em>R. v. F. (W.J.)</em> (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), the trial judge
    noted that the requirement is that the evidence in question be “reasonably
    necessary” to prove a fact in issue and includes situations in which the
    witness is unable or unwilling to provide an accurate and frank recital of
    events. The trial judge concluded that the first two statements were reasonably
    necessary: “This is a six year old child who does not want to discuss the
    things she previously said her daddy did to her.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that procedural substitutes were not present in this case.
    His finding that the first two statements satisfied the criteria of “threshold
    reliability” was grounded in his conclusion that they were substantively
    reliable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the first statement was “short, simple, and spontaneous”
    and was heard by a neighbour, in addition to the mother. The brevity of the
    statement alleviated concerns that it might have been improperly heard by the
    witnesses and conveyed to the court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the case of the second statement, the trial judge was satisfied as to the
    truthfulness and accuracy of the social worker’s testimony. Considering the
    direction in <em>Bradshaw</em> that, in assessing substantive reliability,
    trial judges consider alternative, even speculative explanations for the
    hearsay statements, the trial judge addressed the appellant’s suggestion that
    others were to blame for exposing the complainant to pornography or abusing
    her: “This speculation does not trouble me given the level of sexually explicit
    details given by such a young girl in the strikingly similar play therapy
    hearsay and video statement.” </p>
  <p class=LHeading11>The appellant’s submissions</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that neither of the first two statements satisfied the
    criteria of “necessity” and “threshold reliability”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Citing <em>R. v. Rhayel</em>, 2015 ONCA 377, 324 C.C.C. (3d) 362, at para. 73, he
    argues that neither of the first two statements satisfied the “necessity”
    criterion because they were repetitious of the video recording admitted under
    s. 715.1 of the <em>Code</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to substantive reliability, the appellant argues that in assessing the first
    statement, the trial judge did not address C.L.’s statement, made at the same
    time as her first statement, that the appellant had “punched me in the face.”
    C.L.’s mother had never noticed signs of C.L. having been punched in the face.
    This, the appellant argues, undermined the credibility and reliability of
    C.L.’s first statement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor,
    he argues, did the trial judge address the alternative explanation the
    appellant offered for both the first and second statements in assessing the
    substantive reliability of the first statement, namely that C.L. might have
    been abused or exposed to pornography by others. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as to the threshold reliability of the second statement, the appellant argues
    that the trial judge failed to consider that, between the first statement and
    the second statement, C.L.’s mother had disregarded police instructions to
    refrain from discussing the allegations with C.L. Citing <em>R. v. D.R.</em>,
    [1996] 2 S.C.R. 291, the appellant argues that C.L.’s statement did not satisfy
    the requirement of threshold reliability because it was equally consistent with
    the hypothesis that her mother had influenced her to make the allegations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge improperly relied on the video recording
    to reject an alternative explanation for, and to corroborate, the second
    statement, offending the rationale of the rule that prior consistent statements
    are presumptively inadmissible. </p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject these arguments. </p>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The “necessity&quot;
    requirement</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    first to the appellant’s argument that neither the first nor the second
    statement satisfied the “necessity” requirement, there is no “bright line rule
    that enjoins all cumulative hearsay”: <em>R. v. Mohamad</em>, 2018 ONCA 966,
    369 C.C.C. (3d) 211, at para. 123. Defence counsel at trial did not challenge
    “necessity” on the basis of cumulative hearsay, but, in any event, this case is
    different from <em>Rhayel</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Rhayel</em>,
    the court held that the complainant’s video-recorded statement was not admissible
    under the principled exception to the hearsay rule because it was not
    necessary: the evidence was already before the court through the complainant’s
    testimony at the preliminary inquiry. Epstein J.A., writing for the court,
    explained that evidence which is merely repetitious of statements already
    admitted may have little or no probative value, and the prejudice to the
    accused resulting from its admission may be great: <em>Rhayel</em>, at para. 73.
    The risk of prejudice is recognized in the rule that renders prior consistent
    statements generally inadmissible. Epstein J.A. noted that, on a number of
    occasions, the trial judge had commented on how very similar the accounts of
    the complainant were. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the first and second statements had probative value in and of
    themselves because of the circumstances in which they were made. The
    complainant’s statements that “daddy ate my patoon” and “yuk, my dad did that
    to me” and her gestures during play therapy describing the sexual acts were
    spontaneous and unprompted. It is their spontaneity that gives them their
    probative value. The complainant’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry in <em>Rhayel</em> was not spontaneous. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    there was more detail given in the statements made and gestures shown to and
    recounted by the social worker than in the video recording. They were not
    merely repetitious of the video recording. </p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Substantive
    reliability</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk70325030">[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn next to the issues that the appellant raises with respect to the
    substantive reliability of the first statement</a>. The appellant correctly
    notes that the trial judge did not address C.L.’s statement, made at the same
    time as her first statement, that the appellant had “punched me in the face.”
    This is not surprising: the appellant does not dispute that defence counsel at
    trial did not refer to the “punched me in the face” statement in his oral or
    written submissions. Moreover, the statement of a four-year old, in the context
    of a sexual encounter, that she had been “punched” in the face does not
    necessarily mean she was hit with such force as to leave a visible mark. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the appellant’s alternative explanation for the first statement, in a phone
    call with the complainant’s mother (which the mother’s friend listened to), the
    appellant pointed the finger at the mother’s father and brothers and the
    babysitter. But the mother testified that: neither of her brothers had access
    to C.L. outside of the mother’s supervision; she does not have a babysitter;
    and she has not seen her father in years. And C.L. never wavered on the fact
    that it was “daddy” who ate her patoon. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk70063747">[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the threshold reliability of the second statement, the
    trial judge specifically considered and ruled out the appellant’s speculative
    explanation for the statement. The appellant does not challenge the Crown’s
    explanation that the appellant’s trial counsel did not advance a similar
    argument with respect to the first statement and it is therefore not surprising
    that the trial judge’s analysis focuses only on the second statement. As noted
    above, the trial judge’s reasons for admitting the three statements at issue
    formed part of his judgment finding the appellant guilty of sexual assault and
    sexual interference. In rejecting the appellant’s testimony and finding that it
    did not leave him with a reasonable doubt, the trial judge again addressed the
    appellant’s alternative explanation, and concluded that it was “nothing more
    than an attempt to deflect attention from himself.” </a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk70063758">[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reading the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, it is clear he concluded
    that the appellant’s speculative explanation was not plausible and ruled it
    out. The fact that the trial judge did not specifically address the appellant’s
    speculative explanation in the portion of his reasons addressing why the first
    statement satisfied the requirement of threshold reliability is not a basis for
    this court to interfere. </a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk70063731">[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the second statement, the trial judge specifically considered
    the risk that the mother had influenced C.L. in assessing whether the delay
    before the making of the video recording was reasonable. This, the Crown
    advises, is the primary context in which the appellant’s trial counsel made
    this argument and it is therefore not surprising that this is where the trial
    judge addressed it. As noted above, the trial judge found that the video record
    suggests most of the words spoken were C.L.’s own and concluded that the
    concern about the mother’s influence on C.L. could be addressed in determining
    ultimate reliability. It cannot be said that the trial judge failed to
    “consider” the risk that the mother influenced C.L. in assessing threshold
    reliability. </a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    in his reasons for judgment, the trial judge again specifically addressed the
    possibility that the mother had influenced C.L. by questioning her about the
    allegations. In his view, the circumstances in which the first two statements
    were made “undermine[d] the assertion the complainant’s trial testimony was
    tainted by external influences.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant’s argument that the trial judge improperly relied on the video recording
    to reject an alternative explanation for, and to corroborate, the second
    statement arises out of the passage in the trial judge’s reasons explaining why
    he rejected the appellant’s speculative explanation for C.L.’s second hearsay
    statement: “This speculation does not trouble me <span class=Underline>given
    the level of sexually explicit details given by such a young girl</span> in the
    strikingly similar play therapy hearsay and video statement” (emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the appellant’s argument, the trial judge did not use the fact that there
    were similarities between the video recording and the second statement to
    conclude that the second statement was more likely to be true. Rather, it was
    the graphic detail in her accounts — “the level of sexually explicit details” —
    that caused him to reject the appellant’s speculative explanation for C.L.’s
    second statement. The trial judge’s careful analysis of why, in the
    circumstances, both the first and the second statements were admissible
    demonstrates that he was aware that prior consistent statements are generally
    inadmissible. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
