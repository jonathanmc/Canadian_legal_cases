    by Justice Patrice F. Band of the Ontario Court of Justice on November 14,
    2017, with reasons reported at 2017 ONCJ 805. </span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Feldman J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant is a Black man who was pulled over
    for suspected impaired driving, then wrongfully arrested for driving while
    suspended. When he was searched following the arrest, he was found with a
    loaded firearm. The appellant was convicted of possession of a firearm with
    ammunition and possession of a firearm contrary to a weapons prohibition. He
    appeals his convictions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s position at trial and on this
    appeal is that the stop and the arrest were unlawful because they were tainted
    by racial profiling. Therefore, the firearm should have been excluded from
    evidence under s. 24(2) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.
    The Crown agrees that if racial profiling played any part in the stop or the
    arrest, the evidence should be excluded.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The primary issue on the appeal is whether the
    trial judge misapplied the test for racial profiling, and erred in law by
    requiring a finding that the police lied about the reasons for the stop and for
    the arrest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the appellant. I would allow the
    appeal and order a new trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Circumstances of the Stop</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The stop occurred at around 2:46 a.m. on March
    5, 2017. The appellant was driving a Ford Focus rental vehicle. He was driving
    west on Derry Road near the airport. There was little traffic. Two Peel police
    officers, PC Robert Delmar and PC Jane King, were on general patrol in a marked
    police vehicle, and happened to be driving behind the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was not speeding. However, PC
    Delmar observed the appellant’s car activate its right turn signal and enter
    the right turn lane, but not turn right. The car swerved back into the thru-lane
    without signalling, eventually reactivated the right turn signal, but again did
    not turn right. PC Delmar said he saw the vehicle swerve within its lane. He
    concluded that the driver might be impaired. In his testimony at trial, PC
    Delmar described the appellant’s driving as a marked departure from what he ordinarily
    saw on the roads. PC King corroborated PC Delmar’s account of the aborted right
    turn, but she said the right turn signal was never deactivated and she did not
    see the vehicle swerve within its lane.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The officers pulled up beside the appellant, and
    as they continued to drive, shone the alley light from their vehicle into the driver’s
    side of the appellant’s vehicle. The officers saw that the appellant was a
    young Black man with a beard alone in the car. They then dropped back behind the
    appellant’s vehicle and activated their emergency lights directing him to stop.
    The officers said the appellant’s car touched the curb when he stopped, which
    he denied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the officers described their procedure
    as a “combination stop” that they commonly use. The purpose is to get a look at
    the driver and obtain information that could identify him before the driver
    knows he is being stopped, in case the driver takes off.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The officers’ notes describing these events did
    not say that the officers made the decision to stop the appellant before they
    saw that he was a Black man. The notes were silent on this issue. However, after
    the appellant served and filed his <em>Charter</em> challenge alleging racial
    profiling, the officers met with the Crown attorney (not Crown counsel on the
    appeal), and subsequently prepared will-say statements stating that they had made
    the decision to stop the appellant’s vehicle based on the appellant’s driving, before
    they performed the combination stop and saw the appellant.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Circumstances of the Arrest</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>PC Delmar went to the driver’s side of the
    appellant’s vehicle and spoke to him while PC King went to the passenger side
    and looked into the vehicle. PC Delmar asked the appellant if he had been
    drinking and he answered no. There was no smell of alcohol, but PC Delmar
    noticed the smell of fresh marijuana. PC Delmar saw a pill bottle in the
    vehicle, which he took from the appellant and placed on the roof of the car
    along with the keys. He asked the appellant for his license, ownership and
    insurance, but the appellant could not produce any of the requested documents. Instead,
    he gave the officers the name, Donovan Sitladeen, which was not his name but
    his brother’s.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When PC Delmar went back to his car to check the
    name in CPIC, a police database, he made a mistake in the spelling of “Sitladeen,”
    inputting “Sitaldeen” instead. He thus received results with a “partial score.”
    They revealed the possibility that Donovan Sitladeen was a suspended driver,
    subject to a weapons prohibition, known to be armed and dangerous and of
    interest to the Toronto Police. However, CPIC attached an accuracy score of
    13/26 which indicated to PC Delmar that something was “off” regarding the identity
    of the driver. PC Delmar believed that he needed to confirm the appellant’s
    identity. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>PC King subsequently informed PC Delmar that the
    pill bottle had the name, Damaine Sitladeen. PC Delmar checked the new name in
    CPIC, but again with the incorrect spelling, “Sitaldeen.” The result left the
    officer “more confused” than before. The system would usually provide a
    photograph if there was information in the database, but no photograph was
    generated in either instance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the meantime, another officer, PC Statham,
    arrived at the scene. Although PC Delmar did not have any further discussion
    with the appellant to ask about his identity, he decided that he was going to
    arrest the appellant for driving while suspended because he wasn’t able to
    confirm his identity. PC Statham agreed with that decision. PC Statham walked
    over to the car and asked the appellant about the status of his driver’s
    license and whether he had any unpaid fines. The appellant responded that his
    license was “good” and that there should be no unpaid fines.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>PC Delmar came over to the car and told the
    appellant he was under arrest for driving while suspended. By then, a fourth
    officer had arrived at the scene. The appellant stated that he thought the officers
    were making a big deal over nothing. PC Statham responded that it was a simple
    matter of confirming his identification and getting him a court date. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was reluctant to exit the car. When
    PC Delmar attempted to gain control of the appellant to handcuff him, there was
    a struggle which culminated in three officers<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

    waistband.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The entire interaction between the appellant and

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Issues</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The primary issue for trial was whether the
    stop, the arrest and/or the search of the appellant were tainted by racial
    profiling. If they were, it was agreed that the evidence found would be
    inadmissible. To address the issue, the trial judge had to state the correct
    test for racial profiling, and then weigh the evidence to determine whether it
    met the test. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant raised two arguments at trial. First,
    the purported sobriety check was a pretext stop by the police to allow them to detain
    and search a Black driver. This submission was based primarily on evidence that
    PC Delmar exaggerated the nature of the impugned driving, the officers drove up
    beside the appellant and saw that he was a Black man before they effected the
    stop, and following the stop, they did not conduct any investigation for
    impaired driving after the appellant said that he had not been drinking and
    they observed no smell of alcohol. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, and in the alternative, if the traffic
    stop was lawful, the circumstances of the arrest of the appellant for driving
    while suspended and the subsequent search by the police indicated that they were
    motivated by the appellant’s race.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Test for Racial Profiling</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge quoted paras. 7 and 44-45 from
    the leading Ontario Court of Appeal case on racial profiling, <em>R. v. Brown</em> (2003)<i>, </i>64 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), for the definition, and the test for
    making a finding of racial profiling: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoQuote style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-CA style='color:
windowtext;font-style:normal'>[7] Racial profiling is criminal profiling based
    on race. Racial or colour profiling refers to that phenomenon whereby certain
    criminal activity is attributed to an identified group in society on the basis
    of race or colour resulting in the targeting of individual members of that
    group. In this context, race is illegitimately used as a proxy for the
    criminality or general criminal propensity of an entire racial group.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoQuote style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-CA style='color:
windowtext;font-style:normal'>…</span></p>
  <p class=MsoQuote style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-CA style='color:
windowtext;font-style:normal'>[44] A racial profiling claim could rarely be
    proven by direct evidence. This would involve an admission by a police officer
    that he or she was influenced by racial stereotypes in the exercise of his or
    her discretion to stop a motorist. Accordingly, if racial profiling is to be
    proven it must be done by inference drawn from circumstantial evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoQuote style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-CA style='color:
windowtext;font-style:normal'>[45] [W]here the evidence shows that the
    circumstances relating to a detention correspond to the phenomenon of racial
    profiling and provide a basis for the court to infer that the police officer is
    lying about why he or she singled out the accused person for attention, the
    record is then capable of supporting a finding that the stop was based on
    racial profiling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence sought to file and rely on a recent
    article, “Applying the Racial Profiling Correspondence Test” (2017) 64 Crim L.Q.
    359, by Professor David M. Tanovich, whom the trial judge acknowledged to be a
    respected academic and author who had been cited by the Supreme Court of Canada
    and all levels of court in Ontario. The Crown, however, objected to the court
    receiving the article, on the basis that it contained hearsay and opinion, and because
    it is an advocacy piece on the interpretation of the law of racial profiling
    that could usurp the role of the trial judge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the test from <em>Brown</em>, Professor Tanovich focused on the circumstances

lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first was that the officers only prepared
    their notes after meeting together with detectives from the Criminal
    Investigations Branch who would be taking over the investigation of the firearm.
    The trial judge identified a number of concerns with this police procedure that
    could undermine the public’s confidence in law enforcement, including the spectre
    of collusion and the inconsistency with the duty of police officers to make
    their notes as soon as practicable: <em>Wood v. Schaeffer</em>, 2013 SCC 71, [2013]
    3 S.C.R. 1053, at para. 67. </span></p>

    collusion, based on some “potentially important” differences in the accounts of
    the officers, and his opinion that had they colluded, they would have come up
    with a better account of PC Delmar’s grounds for the arrest. The trial judge
    was also satisfied, based on the way PC Delmar answered questions, that his
    evidence was his own and was based on his independent recollection of the
    event.</span></p>

    was the creation of the officers’ will-say statements following a meeting with
    the Crown attorney after the <em>Charter</em> challenge based on racial
    profiling was filed. The defence argued that the officers used their will-say
    statements to embellish the critical issue for this trial, i.e. at what point
    they made the decision to pull over the appellant. The will-says fleshed out
    the manner in which the stop was conducted. They identified by name the
    “combination stop” procedure, and explicitly indicated, for the first time, that
    it was before the officers pulled up beside the appellant and shone their light
    on him that they formed the grounds to stop him.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that there was nothing

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the combination stop, the trial
    judge first commented that he had never before heard of the procedure, although
    there was evidence that it was one of the methods used by Peel police to
    prevent a pursuit, the idea being that a driver is less likely to flee if the
    police are able to identify him. The trial judge accepted PC Delmar’s evidence
    that he uses the combination stop regularly.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel’s main argument was that the
    following evidence supported the inference that the stop of the appellant’s
    vehicle was racially motivated: (1) the officers decided to pull the appellant
    over only after they drove up beside him and saw that he was a young Black man
    with a beard; (2) their notes, which were made before they knew there was going
    to be a s. 9 <em>Charter</em> challenge based on racial profiling, did not state
    when they decided to pull over the appellant’s car; and (3) the notes do not refer
    to a combination stop. The officers’ versions of the impugned driving were also
    different, including that PC King did not see the appellant swerve within his
    lane.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I note here that in his closing submissions,
    defence counsel emphasized another factor that indicated the stop was a “ruse.”
    Even though the officers claimed that the reason they had stopped the
    appellant’s vehicle was for suspected impairment, after he denied any alcohol
    consumption and they did not smell any alcohol on the appellant, they took no steps
    to investigate the smell of fresh marihuana and the two pill bottles in the
    car. The trial judge did not address this argument in his main analysis of the
    propriety of the stop, but only referred to it briefly in the reasons following
    the discussion of the appellant’s arrest. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-CA>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Evidence of the officers</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his reasons, the trial judge reviewed the
    evidence given by the two officers, PC Delmar and PC King, with respect to the
    appellant’s driving, and found that he preferred PC Delmar’s evidence over the
    evidence given by PC King. He was not troubled by the fact that their notes neither
    stated when the officers formed the grounds to effect the stop, nor mentioned
    the combination stop because the notes contained functional descriptions of
    both.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then made the finding that he
    believed PC Delmar saw the poor driving and found out that the Ford Focus was a
    rental car before he decided to undertake the combination stop and learned the
    race of the appellant. The trial judge agreed with the officer that the nature
    of the appellant’s driving in that specific area and at the time of night
    provided ample articulable cause for the stop. He accepted PC Delmar’s concern
    that had the appellant fled, the potential consequences would have been “on him”.
    As a result of believing the officer, the trial judge concluded that the
    circumstances did not correspond to racial profiling, and the defence had not
    demonstrated a pretext stop.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After making that finding, the trial judge considered
    whether the evidence of what happened following the stop, leading up to the
    arrest and search, undermined PC Delmar’s credibility regarding the reason for
    the stop. Defence counsel asserted that the stop was used to create an
    opportunity to arrest and search the appellant because he is a Black man. Defence
    counsel focused on two points: (1) what he argued was PC Delmar’s exaggerated
    description of the appellant’s alleged poor driving; and (2) PC Delmar’s failure
    to conduct an impaired driving investigation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected both arguments because
    he accepted PC Delmar’s explanations. He found PC Delmar’s description of the
    appellant’s driving as a “marked departure” to be reasonable because he was
    dealing with a situation where the appellant suddenly veered out of the right
    turn lane, also described as a channel lane. While agreeing that what occurred
    following the stop was not a typical impaired driving investigation, the trial
    judge accepted PC Delmar’s explanation for taking no steps to investigate
    impairment. He accepted that in the absence of an odour of alcohol, burnt
    marijuana or obvious signs of impairment, PC Delmar’s suspicion of impaired
    driving was not borne out. He was also satisfied that PC Delmar gave some
    consideration to the pills, but he did not recognize them and did not give them
    more thought because they were obviously not narcotics. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found, however, that PC Delmar’s
    decision to arrest the appellant because he was confused about the appellant’s
    identity and concerned that the appellant might be a suspended driver was not
    based on reasonable and probable grounds. While the trial judge concluded that
    PC Delmar did not act in bad faith, he characterized the officer’s actions as
    careless and hasty. He concluded that PC Delmar became overly focused on the
    difficulty of confirming the appellant’s verbal identification and that his “inadvertent
    spelling error [in the CPIC search], and his failure to pause and consider his
    own human frailty, only contributed to the problem.” As a result, the trial
    judge held that the arrest and the search violated the appellant’s ss. 8 and 9 <em>Charter</em> rights.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Having made these findings, the trial judge
    again addressed the racial profiling allegation. He found first that the arrest
    and search were not racially motivated, and second, that the subsequent
    breaches of s. 8 and s. 9 by the police did not make him believe that the initial
    traffic stop was a ruse. He then concluded the racial profiling issue at para.
    75 of his reasons by finding that the circumstances did not give him a basis to
    find that the officers were lying:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[75] Nonetheless, I am aware of the optics
    surrounding the arrest and believe it is important to address them. Within 10
    minutes of being lawfully stopped by two officers who reasonably (but
    incorrectly) suspected that he was an impaired driver, a Black man was arrested
    and taken to the ground by four officers. From a bird’s eye view, these factors
    gave me pause. However, when understood in context, they did not give me a
    basis upon which to infer that the officers were <u>lying</u>. PC Statham’s
    testimony was of particular interest. It was thoughtful and credible. I accept
    that it is common for officers to slide-by a traffic stop and that PC Statham
    did so while knowing nothing about the details. I also believed him that he
    gave PC Tisdale a “thumb’s-up” just prior to Mr. Sitladeen’s arrest. This tells
    me that until that point, the situation was rather routine. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, the trial judge found that while the <em>Charter</em>-infringing
    conduct was not a trivial or minor breach, it was careless and hasty but not
    reckless. He noted that PC Delmar’s decision to arrest the appellant must be
    viewed in context: the appellant did not produce a driver’s license when asked
    to do so and gave a false name, leading to a “murky” situation that was
    complicated by the partial CPIC results. The trial judge expressed concern that
    PC Statham agreed with PC Delmar’s decision to arrest without reasonable and
    probable grounds, but he did not find that to be evidence of a systemic or institutional
    concern. As a result, on the first <em>Grant</em> factor, he concluded that the
    seriousness of the police conduct did not pull strongly in favour of exclusion.</span></p>

    no role in the decision. Nevertheless, a trial judge is entitled to reject that

lang=EN-CA>2019 SCC 34, 375 C.C.C. (3d) 431, was not a racial profiling case,
    but explored the role of systemic racial discrimination in the perception of an
    accused as to whether he is being detained by police. In that context, the Supreme
    Court commented on racial profiling by police and confirmed, at para. 76, that racial
    profiling occurs when race or racial stereotypes are used, either consciously
    or unconsciously, and to any degree, in the selection or treatment of a
    suspect. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court elaborated on that comment from <em>Le</em> in its recent decision on racial profiling in <em>R. v. Dudhi</em>, 2019 ONCA
    665, 147 O.R. (3d) 546. There, one of the arresting officers referred to “brown
    drug dealers” in a radio transmission to police colleagues before he arrested
    the accused. The accused claimed that the arrest was tainted by racial
    profiling. The trial judge, however, rejected the claim on the basis that the
    arrest was justified on other grounds. This court held that the trial judge
    erred in so doing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Brown</em>, this court stated, at para.
    11, that to prove a s. 9 breach, the applicant must show that there was no
    articulable cause for the stop and it was based on colour. Paciocco J.A. for
    this court in <em>Dudhi</em><i> </i>explained, at paras. 62-63, that the
    statement does not mean that in such cases, the racial profiling component is
    irrelevant to the analysis. To the contrary, where an officer has objective
    grounds to detain an individual, those grounds cannot justify that decision if
    they are tainted by any degree of racial profiling:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[62] In my view, it is self-evident that a
    decision need not be motivated <span class=underline0><u><span
style='color:black'>solely or even mainly </span></u></span>on race or racial
    stereotypes to nevertheless be “based on” race or racial stereotypes. If
    illegitimate thinking about race or racial stereotypes factors into suspect
    selection or subject treatment, any pretence that the decision was reasonable
    is defeated. The decision will be contaminated by improper thinking and cannot
    satisfy the legal standards in place for suspect selection or subject
    treatment.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[63] Put simply, passages such as para. 11 of <em>R.
    v. Brown</em>, and para. 33 in <em>Bombardier</em>, are entirely consistent
    with the proposition accepted in <em>Le</em><em><span style='color:black;
font-style:normal'> </span></em>and <em>Peart</em>. Where race or racial
    stereotypes are used to any degree in suspect selection or subject treatment,
    there will be no reasonable suspicion or reasonable grounds. The decision will
    amount to racial profiling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He concluded, at para. 64:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[64] This outcome is sensible, even leaving
    aside questions about what reasonableness entails. If objective considerations
    could negate improper subjective reliance on race or racial stereotypes, the
    subjective component of these legal standards would be ignored. That should not
    be. As was recently explained in <em>R. v. Lai</em>, 2019 ONCA 420, at paras.
    29-30, the subjective component of the relevant legal standards plays an
    important role in ensuring that the police act for legitimate purposes and turn
    their minds to the legal authority they possess: see also <em>R. v. Caslake</em>,
    [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 27. A body of law that permits officers to
    exercise their power when subjectively, their decisions are influenced by race
    or racial stereotypes, has little to commend it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To summarize, the case law from <em>Brown</em> onward recognizes that in cases where an officer had objective grounds to
    detain a person or stop a vehicle but was also subjectively motivated by racial
    stereotypes, the officer is unlikely to admit his bias. The matter becomes more
    complicated when the officer is unaware that he was influenced by race because
    of unconscious bias. The officer may not be consciously lying about his
    motivation, but that does not mean he did not unconsciously engage in racial
    profiling. It is the role of the trial judge in such cases to consider all the
    circumstances that led to an accused’s detention and/or arrest and to determine
    whether they correspond to the phenomenon of racial profiling, as understood in
    the social science literature, the reports of inquiries into race relations
    with police<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

    and the case law. The trial judge can then decide whether those corresponding circumstances
    form a basis to infer that the record is capable of supporting a finding that
    the stop was based on racial profiling, contrary to the evidence of the
    officer. Ultimately, to reach a conclusion about racial profiling, the trial
    judge is not required to find that a police officer who testifies that race
    played no role in the decision to detain or arrest was lying.</span></p>

    analysis by focusing on whether the officers lied? </span></h4>

lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s position is not that lying is a
    necessary element of the correspondence test, but that the trial judge’s
    reasons show that he did not believe that it was, because that would be inconsistent
    with his recognition that racial profiling can be subconscious. I agree that it
    would be inconsistent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s position is that the trial judge
    considered the totality of the circumstances in concluding that there was no
    conscious or unconscious racial profiling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept this submission. In my view, it
    is clear from the reasons that the trial judge was focused on the need to find
    that the officers were lying in order to draw the conclusion that there was
    racial profiling. While he mentioned early in his reasons that racial profiling
    can be the result of subconscious attitudes, he did not specifically find that
    there was no unconscious racial profiling by PC Delmar. This is critical
    because by failing to address whether unconscious racial bias played any role
    in the officers’ decision to stop or to arrest the appellant, the trial judge eliminated
    the possibility that the stop or arrest may have been tainted by racial
    profiling, even if there was also another available basis to justify the police
    actions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I refer first to para. 26 of the reasons, where
    the trial judge stated: “Professor Tanovich’s version [of the correspondence
    test] eliminates an element that is crucial for judges intending to
    operationalize the test.” That element was that the circumstances must “provide
    a basis for the court to infer that the police officer is lying about why he or
    she singled out the accused person for attention.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>From that point forward, the trial judge focused
    on the credibility of PC Delmar and considered each of his impugned actions in
    that context: the potential for collusion between officers in making their
    notes after meeting together; the differences between the notes and the will-say
    statements on the crucial issue of when the officers decided to stop the
    appellant’s car; whether the appellant’s driving was sufficiently aberrant to
    give the police the basis to stop the appellant on suspicion of impaired
    driving and whether their subsequent failure to conduct a sobriety
    investigation was consistent with their alleged concern; whether PC Delmar
    exaggerated the description of the erratic driving by calling it a marked
    departure from the driving he usually sees; and, the haste to arrest the
    appellant for the offence of driving while suspended for which they did not
    have reasonable and probable grounds. In respect of each action, the trial
    judge found that he believed the officer and that his conduct or his reaction
    was a reasonable one. From that, the trial judge concluded that there was no racial
    profiling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also highlight the final two paragraphs of the
    trial judge’s reasons on this issue. In para. 74, after finding that there were
    no reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest and search of the appellant
    and that the officers violated the appellant’s ss. 8 and 9 <em>Charter</em> rights, the trial judge found the arrest and search were not racially motivated
    and further, that those breaches did not “lead [him] to find that the traffic
    stop was probably a ruse after all.” A ruse is a deliberate act. That
    characterization excludes the possibility that the breaches were or could have
    been the result of unconscious bias.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, in para. 75, already quoted, the trial
    judge makes his key finding that while the “optics surrounding the arrest” gave
    him pause, “when understood in context, they did not give [him] a basis upon
    which to infer that the officers were lying.” He added that PC Statham’s
    testimony was “of particular interest” because it was thoughtful and credible,
    and indicated a routine situation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The major factual issue that all parties focused
    on at trial was the purpose and effect of the combination stop. From the
    appellant’s point of view, what occurred was that he was driving normally, not
    speeding, when a police car drove up beside him, shone a light on him, saw that
    he was a Black man, then fell back, and turned on its lights and siren to pull him
    over. The officers’ version was that they decided to stop the appellant before
    they saw him and knew he was Black. If that was true, then racial profiling was
    not a factor in the stop.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While it was therefore important for the trial
    judge to assess the credibility and reliability of the officers’ evidence on the
    issue of when they decided to carry out the stop, by focusing on whether they were
    lying, the trial judge failed to also consider whether the circumstances that
    could correspond to racial profiling could support the inference that unconscious
    racial profiling played a role. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For example, even if the police were concerned
    about the appellant’s driving before the combination stop, given all the
    circumstances, including a low-end rental vehicle driving in an area with clubs
    and bars late at night, did seeing that the appellant was a Black man have the
    effect of confirming a decision to stop his vehicle?<a href="#_ftn6"

    Delmar’s confusion and haste leading to an illegal arrest and search of a Black
    man a circumstance that corresponds with unconscious racial profiling?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, by concentrating on whether the
    officers were lying to the court when he assessed their impugned conduct and whether
    the circumstances could correspond to racial profiling, the trial judge improperly
    limited his analysis. While he acknowledged that racial bias is often
    subconscious and therefore hard to prove, his approach did not allow him to assess
    the reliability of the officers’ testimony about their own motivation in the
    context of all the circumstances. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In response to my colleague’s dissent, at para. 108 of his
    reasons, he states that “the officer’s mental state or attitude on subsequently
    discovering that the appellant was a Black man could not negate or ‘taint’ the
    reasonableness of the earlier decision to make the traffic stop.” That could be
    true if the officer had implemented the decision to stop before he saw that the
    appellant was a Black man. However, here, he did not stop the car until after
    he saw the appellant’s race.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I also reject his suggestion that my reasons create a presumption
    of racial profiling, instead of recognizing the onus of proof on an accused
    when a <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em> breach is alleged. The onus of
    proof was not in dispute or at issue at trial or on the appeal. The issue is
    the trial judge’s fundamental responsibility to correctly articulate and apply
    the test for racial profiling based on the evidence. Here, the trial judge had
    circumstantial evidence from which a finding of racial profiling could be made,
    but he failed to correctly state and apply the correspondence test to that
    evidence to determine if racial profiling affected the decisions of the police
    to stop and arrest the appellant. </p>

lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Racial profiling is an injustice rooted in a failure of practical
    reasoning. The inquiry into whether racial profiling occurred is focused
    entirely on the chain of reasoning that led a police officer to investigate,
    detain, or arrest a particular suspect: <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Le</span></em>,
    2019 SCC 34, 434 D.L.R. (4th) 631, at paras. 76-78. As this court explained in <em><span

    Peel Regional Police Services Board</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span><span

    occurs where</span>: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>a police officer … uses race (consciously or subconsciously) as
    an indicator of potential unlawful conduct based not on any personalized
    suspicion, but on negative stereotyping that attributes propensity for unlawful
    conduct to individuals because of race…</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Racial profiling is an act of decision-making – a reasoning
    process leading to a decision. It is not a general disposition or attitude.
    Racial profiling may result from conscious or unconscious bias that diverts a
    decision-maker from proper individualized reasoning: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Peart</span></em>,
    at para. 93. Accordingly, the inquiry into whether a police officer racially
    profiled someone is not resolved by determining whether that officer in general
    holds conscious or unconscious racist attitudes. It is possible for the
    reasoning of someone who is otherwise scrupulously and self-consciously
    egalitarian to be misshapen by unconscious bias in making a particular
    decision. The focus is on evaluating the particular “internal mental process”
    that led to the specific police action under investigation: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Le</span></em>, at para. 78.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If a police officer employs a negative racial stereotype as a
    premise in a chain of reasoning culminating in a decision to investigate,
    detain, or arrest someone, that faulty decision-making cannot be cured by the
    fact that there were other, legitimate grounds the officer could have relied on
    to come to the same conclusion: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Peart</span></em>, at
    para. 91. The focus is on how this particular officer <i><span lang=EN-CA>actually</span></i> reasoned on this particular occasion. It is therefore a factual question: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Peart</span></em>, at paras. 6, 104, 131. How an officer reasoned at

    The trial judge, in the second paragraph of his reasons, acknowledged the
    wrongness of racial profiling, its existence in the criminal justice system,
    that it tends to occur unconsciously rather than consciously, and that it must
    therefore usually be proven by inference from circumstantial evidence. The
    hearing of the <em>Charter</em> application included extensive exchanges
    between the trial judge and both counsel on whether an inference of bias could
    be drawn from the circumstantial evidence. It is telling, however, that the
    language of unconscious bias was almost entirely absent from defence counsel’s
    initial argument, which for the most part did not distinguish between conscious
    and unconscious racial profiling. The concept of unconscious bias only came
    under the spotlight when the trial judge himself raised the issue during the trial
    Crown’s submissions. The subject was only then taken up by defence counsel in
    reply.</span></p>

    decided to arrest the appellant – might support the inference that the

    judge found that PC Delmar decided to stop the appellant’s vehicle before
    discovering the appellant was a Black man. He accepted the decision to stop the
    appellant was based on the nature of the appellant’s driving, late at night, in
    an area known for impaired driving. He further accepted that the combination
    stop was a routine decision, undertaken as the car was a rental, creating a
    flight risk. Since the car was a rental, the appellant’s identity could not be
    determined by running the plates. The trial judge accepted that combination
    stops are performed on the theory that if the driver of a vehicle has been
    visually identified, the driver may be less likely to flee, and rejected the

    was routine because he did not notice him. He also accepted that, shortly

    controversial philosophical or sociological theses, or untested statistical

    addressing the substance of the concluding paragraph, which focused on the
    circumstances of the appellant’s arrest, it is important to keep in mind how
    the trial judge’s analysis of the traffic stop had unfolded by this point in

    found by the trial judge, he could not infer that race factored into the
    officer’s decision to make the traffic stop. This flows from the trial judge’s
    finding that the officer decided to stop the vehicle after observing substandard
    driving, but before he could have known of the driver’s race. He made the
    decision to undertake a two-stage stop – first pulling alongside and making
    visual contact with the driver, and then drawing back to engage the lights –
    after running the vehicle plates and discovering the car to be a rental
    vehicle.</span></span></p>

    argues that, despite this finding, subsequent knowledge of the driver’s race
    could potentially “have the effect of confirming a decision to stop his
    vehicle”, and thus “tainted” the decision before it could be fully executed.
    This argument is speculative and intended merely as an example of the type of
    inquiry the trial judge is said to have overlooked because he is said to have
    focused solely on conscious bias. But it misconceives the nature of racial
    profiling. The reason why a person made a particular decision is a question of
    fact. Those reasons are what they are and cannot be “tainted” by that person’s
    subsequent knowledge and emotional reactions. The most obvious reason why my colleague’s
    example of unconscious bias would not have been addressed by the trial judge
    was not because he failed to consider the possibility of unconscious bias. It
    would be because <a name="_Hlk71193210">the officer’s mental state or attitude
    on subsequently discovering that the appellant was a Black man could not negate
    or “taint” the reasonableness of the earlier decision to make the traffic stop</a>. </span></span></p>

    trial defence counsel conceded that the allegation of racial profiling would be
    “in trouble” if the trial judge found that the officers decided to stop the
    appellant before they learned of his race. The trial judge’s finding that the
    officer did not know the driver was a Black man before deciding to make the
    traffic stop was dispositive of the racial profiling argument concerning the
    traffic stop. The trial judge did not make the error of concluding there was no
    racial profiling because “there was also another available basis to justify the
    police actions.” He concluded there was no racial profiling in the decision to
    stop the appellant because the circumstantial evidence did not support the
    claim.</span></span></p>

    As mentioned earlier, by this point in the reasons, the trial judge had
    considered all of the contextual factors offered in support of the argument
    that the appellant’s race must have motivated the police officers – whether
    consciously or unconsciously – to stop and arrest the appellant. He had
    explained why he was not persuaded that race was a factor in the decision to
    make the traffic stop. And with the decision to make the arrest – a decision
    that the trial judge found to have been arbitrary and a violation of s. 9 – the
    trial judge explained what he concluded had motivated it:</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>The most probable
    explanation of what happened, based on all the evidence, is that PC Delmar
    became overly focused on the difficulty he was having in confirming [the
    appellant’s] verbal identification on the police computer. His inadvertent
    spelling error, and his failure to pause and consider his own human frailty,
    only contributed to the problem. While not evidence of bad faith, it was
    careless and led to haste. </span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>In coming to this
    conclusion, I do not find that the arrest and search were racially motivated.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge
    undertook a more complete analysis of this context in his s. 24(2) analysis. He
    observed that the arrest was careless and hasty, but not reckless. The “murky”
    situation confronting PC Delmar included the CPIC results suggesting the
    appellant presented a danger to the community, which added to his concerns “at
    a time when he was required to make quick decisions.” </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>This context
    informed the trial judge’s conclusion on the racial profiling issue. The
    appellant had given a false name. The name he chose to give – his brother’s –
    carried considerable baggage. The CPIC search not only raised the possibility
    that the appellant – if he was who he claimed to be – had a suspended licence
    and was under a weapons prohibition order, but also that he was a person known
    to be armed and dangerous and of interest to the Toronto Police Service. This
    was, in short, a situation of potentially great danger. The officers knew the
    appellant might not be the person described in the CPIC search. Yet they did
    not know who he was, and it would have been reasonable for them to conclude
    that the appellant believed that giving them this name was to his greater
    advantage than telling the officers who he really was. The trial judge reasoned
    that it was these circumstances that led the officers to act with more haste
    than was justified. This is part of the context that the trial judge had in
    mind when he concluded that the factors that gave him pause did not give him “a
    basis upon which to infer that the officers were lying”, presumably about not
    having been motivated by racial bias.</span></span></p>

    and were based on individualized suspicion. </span></span></p>

    did not err by failing to expressly state the conclusion that PC Delmar did not
    engage in unconscious racial profiling. It was not an error for the trial judge
    to reject the claim, having clearly explained why he was persuaded that the
    officer’s decisions were not informed by racial stereotyping. This does not
    constitute the error identified in Peart, at para. 91, of finding that racial
    stereotyping was part of the officer’s reasoning process, yet justifying it
    because the stop and arrest could have been grounded on some other basis.
    Instead, it is a finding – based on a considered conclusion about how the
    officers actually reasoned, after having considered the totality of the
    evidence – that the impugned decisions were reached without use of racial
    stereotyping. Requiring the Crown to establish anything more would amount to
    imposing the presumption that was rejected by this court in Peart. </span></span></p>

    that the circumstantial evidence did not raise an inference of racial
    profiling, the trial judge considered what remained for him the decisive
    question – did the officers lie? If he concluded the officers had been attempting
    to deceive him, then notwithstanding that the circumstantial evidence did not
    lead him to the inference sought by the appellant, the fact of an attempted
    deception very likely would have. If the officers were not lying, then that was
    necessarily the end of things.</span></span></p>

    question the trial judge needed to answer was whether the appellant’s racial
    identity factored into the officers’ decision to make the traffic stop and
    arrest. It did not matter whether the bias was consciously held or
    unconsciously held, or whether the officers were aware of their reasoning or
    not. The question was to be resolved by looking at all of the evidence,
    particularly the circumstantial evidence. The trial judge did not restrict his
    inquiry to the officers’ denials of racial profiling or whether they were
    attempting to hide their real reasons from him. He did not reason as if, should
    he not find that the police were lying, he would not be able to find racial
    profiling any other way. If he had reasoned in this way, one would have
    expected him to have addressed the issue of lying first, and not engaged with
    the circumstantial evidence in the way he did. Instead, he considered the whole
    of the evidence and found that it did not establish racial profiling. He fully
    and fairly considered the arguments before him and made a finding that was open
    to him. There was nothing else left for him to do. There is no basis to
    interfere with his judgment.</span></span></p>
