  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motions before me relate to claims under the
    Independent Assessment Process (the “IAP”) made against the Attorney General of
    Canada (“Canada”), the responding party, by former residents of St. Anne’s Indian
    Residential School (“St. Anne’s IRS”) pursuant to the Indian Residential School
    Settlement Agreement (the “IRSSA”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The moving parties include three former residents
    of St. Anne’s IRS who made claims under the IAP. They contend that at the time
    their matters were resolved, Canada had failed to fulfill its disclosure
    obligations, and still has not done so. In a request for directions (“RFD”) initiated
    on May 12, 2020 (“Metatawabin RFD #2”), the moving parties seek a declaration
    that Canada breached previous disclosure orders made on January 14, 2014 and
    June 23, 2015 (the “Disclosure Orders”). In Metatawabin RFD #2, the moving
    parties also seek an order compelling Canada to revise documentation used in
    their IAP claims within 30 days, so the claimants can determine whether they
    should seek to re-open those claims. Finally, Metatawabin RFD #2 seeks a preservation
    order preventing Canada from destroying documents that pertain to the St.
    Anne’s IRS IAP claims. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Edmund Metatawabin is also a moving party.
    Dr. Metatawabin is a former St. Anne’s IRS resident and a distinguished
    Indigenous leader who is actively involved in IRSSA matters relating to St.
    Anne’s IRS. In this matter he has offered to represent the interests of St.
    Anne’s IRS abuse survivors whose claims may have been adversely affected by allegedly
    unfair disclosure. Many of these survivors are unknown to the moving parties
    because their identities are confidential under the IRSSA.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The moving parties are pursuing their claims in
    Metatawabin RFD #2 before Glustein J. under the IRSSA’s Court Administration
    Protocol (the “CAP”). Ordinarily, Perell J., the Ontario Supervising Judge for
    IRSSA matters, would be hearing Metatawabin RFD #2. However, Perell J. recused
    himself from Metatawabin RFD #2 due to reasonable apprehension of bias concerns
    arising out of a related proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 18, 2021, Canada filed an RFD
    requesting that an Independent Special Advisor (“ISA”) be appointed to conduct
    an independent review of certain St. Anne’s IRS IAP claims. On April 20, 2021,
    Perell J. granted the request. The moving parties seek to stay that order (the
    “Order Under Appeal”) pending appeal. The moving parties contend that the Order
    Under Appeal improperly undercuts the Metatawabin RFD #2 proceedings and provides
    for a process not contemplated in the IRSSA. Moreover, the moving parties say that
    the Order Under Appeal was secured in an abusive manner by Canada in an unfair,
    secret proceeding that did not comply with the CAP, and was issued by a judge who
    should have recused himself in light of his earlier recusal from Metatawabin
    RFD #2.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The moving parties also ask for an interim preservation
    order covering all documents possessed by government officials relating to St.
    Anne’s IRS IAP claimants. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Of course, it is not my role as a motion judge
    to resolve the underlying dispute or to comment on the fairness or wisdom of
    decisions that have been taken below. My sole function is to determine whether
    a stay pending appeal is in the interests of justice based on established legal
    standards, and to determine whether I should exercise my discretion to issue
    the requested preservation order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For reasons that follow, I am not persuaded it
    is in the interests of justice to stay the Order Under Appeal. Nor, in my view,
    do the interests of justice call for a preservation order. I would therefore
    dismiss the motions before me. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The IRSSA is the settlement agreement for
    several class actions and civil claims relating to sexual and physical abuse of
    former students at Canadian residential schools. In exchange for forfeiting
    their right to sue, potential claimants have the option of participating in the
    IRSSA’s IAP.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Of importance, Canada has responsibilities
    relating to the creation of the evidentiary record to be used in assessing IAP
    claims. Canada is required to disclose relevant documents in its possession and
    control, and it is obliged to use this information to produce a narrative
    report (“Narrative”) relating to each residential school, as well as person of
    interest reports (“POI Reports”) for each claimant for use in the IAP. These
    documents can play an instrumental role in determining the success of IAP
    claims.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The CAP governs the process for RFDs brought
    under the IRSSA. The CAP is administered by nine Supervising Judges; one from
    each of the affected provincial and territorial jurisdictions. Pursuant to the
    terms of the CAP, two Administrative Judges are selected from among the
    Supervising Judges. Perell J., the Ontario Supervising Judge, is the current Eastern
    Administrative Judge (“EAJ”), and his order is the Order Under Appeal. I shall
    refer to him as the EAJ in this endorsement. The current Western Administrative
    Judge (“WAJ”) is the British Columbia Supervising Judge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Any party, counsel, or other entity with
    standing may bring an RFD to the Administrative Judges relating to “all matters
    that require court orders, directions or consideration during the course of the
    administration” of the IRSSA. After receiving an RFD, the EAJ and WAJ must determine
    whether a case conference or a hearing is required. Case conferences may be
    conducted by one or both Administrative Judges. If a hearing is required, the Administrative
    Judges assign the hearing of the RFD to the Supervising Judge from the court
    with jurisdiction over the matter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although all IAP claims have been completed, and
    the IAP ceased operations on March 31, 2021, supervisory courts may review and re-open
    claims where “exceptional circumstances” are present: <em>J.W. v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</em>, 2019 SCC 19, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 224, at para. 27. The
    moving parties take the position that if Canada did breach the Disclosure
    Orders, dispositions and settlement agreements involving St. Anne’s IRS IAP claimants
    may need to be re-opened, and punitive and aggravated damages may be
    appropriate.</span></p>

    Metatawabin RFD #2 was made by the EAJ on January 14, 2014. In it he ordered
    the production of documents relating to an extensive criminal investigation conducted
    by the Ontario Provincial Police into claims of abuse at St. Anne’s IRS. Canada
    was also ordered to comply with its disclosure obligations relating to other
    relevant, non-privileged documents, and to revise the Narrative and POI Reports
    for St. Anne’s IRS. This Order led to the disclosure of more than 12,000
    additional documents and to substantial revisions to the Narrative and to some POI
    Reports.</span></p>

    Metatawabin RFD #2, dated June 23, 2015, was also made by the EAJ. That Order was
    obtained by approximately 50 St. Anne’s IRS IAP claimants who were dissatisfied
    with Canada’s compliance with the January 14, 2014 Disclosure Order. The June 23,
    2015 Disclosure Order directed Canada to revise identified reports to include

    fully complied with the Disclosure Orders; the moving parties contend that Canada
    has not. One of their core complaints is that Canada failed to revise disclosure
    relating to claims that had already been resolved before the Disclosure Orders
    were issued, and that this resulted in unfair settlements affecting an
    estimated 166+ claimants. </span></p>

    brought before the EAJ seeking further enforcement of the Disclosure Orders. The
    moving parties contend these RFDs were not heard on their merits because the
    EAJ “always accepted Canada’s preliminary objections”. They emphasize that courts
    have a duty to ensure all IAP claimants receive the benefits they bargained for
    when they entered into the IRSSA and forfeited their right to sue, but argue
    that the EAJ has breached this obligation by failing to enforce these orders
    and to re-open claims for fair adjudication.</span></p>

    generally, if an order is interlocutory, rather than final, this court lacks jurisdiction

    However, Sharpe J.A. went on to explain that “no stay should be granted in a
    case over which this court lacks jurisdiction”, so if a jurisdictional issue arises
    on a stay motion it should be considered. Likewise, in <em>Fontaine v. Canada

    Simmons J.A. held, at para. 14, that a single judge on a stay motion should

    of the EAJ’s order of June 5, 2020 in which the EAJ purported to assign
    Metatawabin RFD #2 to the WAJ in British Columbia. After rejecting Canada’s
    submission that this order was interlocutory, Simmons J.A. issued a stay pending
    appeal of that order and this court ultimately heard the appeal. Simmons J.A. acknowledged
    that it was not her role as a single judge of this court to determine whether
    the court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, but reasoned that the June
    5, 2020 order was final because it “finally determines a substantive matter –
    the [moving parties’] entitlement to have [Metatawabin RFD #2] heard in the
    forum they say is prescribed by the CAP”: <em>Fontaine Stay #2</em>, at para.
    16. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the moving parties’ analogy to <em>Fontaine
    Stay #2</em> is inapt. A panel of this court has already determined, in related
    proceedings, that a judge’s refusal to recuse themselves is an interlocutory
    matter: <em>Brunning v. Fontaine</em>, 2019 ONCA 98, 144 O.R. (3d) 410, at
    paras. 6-11; see also, <em>Beaver v. Hill</em>, 2019 ONCA 520, at paras. 14-15.
    These cases support my preliminary view that the EAJ’s failure to recuse
    himself from hearing Canada’s RFD is probably an interlocutory decision
    appealable only with leave to the Divisional Court. However, a preliminary
    assessment of whether jurisdiction is likely to arise from other aspects of the
    Order Under Appeal requires further analysis.</span></p>

    O.R. 675 (C.A.), at p. 678, continues to govern in deciding whether an order is
    final or interlocutory. That test is as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The interlocutory order from which there is no
    appeal is an order which does not determine the real matter in dispute between
    the parties – the very subject matter of the litigation, but only some matter
    collateral. It may be final in the sense that it determines the very question
    raised by the application, but it is interlocutory if the merits of the case
    remain to be determined.</span></p>

    fact that the Order Under Appeal appears to have finally resolved the
    appointment of an ISA and the terms of the St. Anne’s Review does not make the
    order a final one. MacFarland J.A. confirmed this point in <em>Waldman v.
    Thomson Reuters Canada Limited</em>, 2015 ONCA 53, 330 O.A.C. 142, at para. 22,
    noting that if an order were deemed final simply because it disposed finally of

    “the very subject matter of the litigation”. The real matter in dispute between
    the parties is whether Canada breached the disclosure obligations it owes to
    St. Anne’s IRS claimants under the IAP. In my view, the Order Under Appeal does
    not resolve that dispute. At most, it provides a procedure for making future
    findings that may bear indirectly upon that dispute. I will explain.</span></p>

    relating to disclosure in the Order Under Appeal. Instead, he appointed the ISA
    as “a referee in accordance with Rule 54 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em> … <em>mutatis</em><i> <em>mutandis</em></i>” who “shall make a report that
    contains his or her findings, conclusions and recommendations.”</span></p>

    unless the report is confirmed by the directing judge after a confirmation hearing
    on notice to the parties: rr. 54.07-54.08. Therefore, if the ISA’s ultimate findings
    do resolve substantive issues between the parties, those findings would not
    arise from the Order Under Appeal, but instead from the ISA’s report, which is
    not yet in existence and which may or may not be confirmed by the EAJ. </span></p>

    168, rev’d on other grounds, 2016 SCC 42, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 162. In <em>Parsons</em>,
    at para. 44, LaForme J.A. (for the majority) took a “somewhat modified
    approach” in distinguishing between final and interlocutory orders within a
    national class action where the substantive merits and defences had already
    been determined by a judicially-approved settlement agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Applying this “somewhat modified approach”,
    LaForme J.A. characterized as final an order determining that supervisory
    judges from different provinces could sit together to hear concurrent motions
    for a proposed protocol extending the first claims deadline in the settlement agreement.
    LaForme J.A. found that the “essential character” of the RFD leading to the
    order was akin to an application to interpret a statute or contract under r.
    14.05(3)(d). By analogy, LaForme J.A. held that the order was therefore final
    rather than interlocutory. </span></p>

    rejected the modified approach endorsed by LaForme J.A., saying it would be confusing.
    In Juriansz J.A.’s view, even where substantive rights have already been
    settled in a class action and no claims or defences remain to be tried, the traditional <em>Hendrickson</em><i> </i>test should still be applied: <em>Parsons</em>, at
    para. 208. For Juriansz J.A., the real issue in dispute was whether the court
    should extend the deadline for filing first claims. He concluded that this issue
    was not finally resolved by determining the forum in which the court could hear
    the underlying motion. Therefore, according to Juriansz J.A., the order under
    appeal was interlocutory and this court did not have jurisdiction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I need not resolve whether the approach taken by
    LaForme J.A. is appropriate because applying that approach would not alter my preliminary
    assessment of the Order Under Appeal. Of importance, in <em>Parsons</em>, at
    para. 53, LaForme J.A. cautioned that not all appeals from orders of
    supervisory judges under a national class action settlement agreement are
    final. The proper characterization will turn on the specific order under appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, even applying LaForme J.A.’s
    somewhat modified approach, the Order Under Appeal is probably interlocutory. Assuming,
    without deciding, that Canada’s RFD may be characterized as analogous to an
    application under r. 14.05, the Order Under Appeal is distinguishable from the
    order in <em>Parsons</em> in at least two material ways<i>. </i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the Order Under Appeal did not determine
    the forum in which any substantive issues between Canada and the moving parties
    would be resolved. The substantive disclosure issues between the parties are
    being litigated in Metatawabin RFD #2 before Glustein J. The Order Under Appeal
    does nothing to prevent that litigation from continuing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the Order Under Appeal is based on r. 54,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, even using the somewhat modified

    is probably interlocutory. If I am correct, this would make the moving parties’
    appeal filed in this court “meritless”: <em>Henderson</em><i>, </i>at para. 8. Regardless
    of the substantive merits of the grounds of appeal advanced by the moving
    parties, this probable absence of jurisdiction undermines the seriousness of
    the issues to be determined. As such, I find that the first <em>RJR-MacDonald</em><i> </i>factor militates against granting the stay.</span></p>

    appeal, this alone would not entitle the moving parties to a stay pending
    appeal. They must ultimately persuade me that a stay is in the interests of
    justice by showing they will suffer irreparable harm if a stay is not granted

    instead on allegations about the harm caused by the Order Under Appeal itself,

    of inconsistent findings between Metatawabin RFD #2 and the Order Under Appeal.
    As I have explained, no findings were made in the Order Under Appeal relating
    to disclosure. The risk of inconsistent findings would arise, if at all, from
    the ISA’s report, which may or may not take legal effect if confirmed at some
    later date. In other words, at this stage, an assessment of whether
    inconsistent legal determinations might arise from the St. Anne’s Review would
    be purely speculative.</span></p>

    a realistic risk that the ISA himself could make findings that are inconsistent
    with those that may be made in Metatawabin RFD #2. Metatawabin RFD #2 is
    concerned with whether Canada breached the Disclosure Orders. Its focus is on
    the disclosure that <u>has not been made</u>, and whether Canada failed to
    revise POI Reports contrary to the Disclosure Orders <u>after</u> those Disclosure
    Orders were issued in 2014-2015. As revealed in the terms of the St. Anne’s
    Review set out at para. 10 of the Order Under Appeal, reproduced at para. 31 above,
    the ISA’s mandate is to consider whether the disclosure that <u>has been made</u> pursuant to the Disclosure Orders was available during IAP claim adjudications
    that occurred <u>before</u> the Disclosure Orders were issued in 2014-2015.</span></p>

    Canada’s RFD, “access to justice for the 166+ St. Anne’s Claimants, in the [Metatawabin

lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This irreparable harm argument is obviously
    linked to the moving parties’ contention in their Notice of Appeal #1 that
    Canada’s RFD was brought to frustrate the Metatawabin RFD #2 hearing that is

    argument in support of Motion #2, I do not accept it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    or adjourn the Metatawabin RFD #2 hearing, nor does it purport to direct anyone
    to discontinue those proceedings. Nor, for the reasons I have given, does the
    Order Under Appeal present a realistic risk of inconsistent findings that could
    compromise the ultimate decision on the merits in Metatawabin RFD #2. Finally,
    the Order Under Appeal does not appear to jeopardize any benefits that may be obtained

    specific mechanism for rectifying underpayment, it is evident that the Order could
    lead to additional payments being made to certain St. Anne’s claimants.  It is
    difficult to characterize the possibility of additional compensation to
    claimants as irreparable harm.</span></p>

    this risk is pressing because the unfairness concerns underlying the St. Anne’s

    to pursue re-opened IAP claims are destroyed before those claims are re-opened.
    The focus of their concern is a “sunset order” that was issued on May 29, 2020 permitting

    Order does not cover all the documents that may be relevant to St. Anne’s IRS IAP
    claims implicated in Metatawabin RFD #2. They argue that the preservation order
    they seek is urgently required to prevent the litigation related to this appeal
    from being undermined by the destruction of documents.</span></p>

    in my view it is not in the interests of justice to do so.</span></p>

    duplicative proceedings. The moving parties have not appealed the WAJ’s Sunset
    Variation Order. On March 18, 2021, the moving parties amended Metatawabin RFD
    #2 to include a request for an order directing Canada not to destroy any IAP
    documents. Therefore, that issue is now before Glustein J. This reduces any
    potential urgency or risk of irreparable harm that may have militated in favour
    of granting the requested preservation order in the interests of justice.</span></p>

    issues relating to the risks associated with preserving highly confidential
    documents. I am not satisfied that all considerations that should bear on the
    preservation order sought by the moving parties were fully argued before me.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, I am not satisfied that the preservation order
    is necessary to prevent prejudice to the moving parties in the context of their
    appeal. On March 23, 2021, Canada advised that it would seek an order
    permitting it to preserve all St. Anne’s IRS documents pending the completion
    of the St. Anne’s Review if court counsel, Mr. Gover, instructed Canada to do
    so. Canada also undertook to preserve those documents from destruction “until
    the RFD is returned”. The next day, Mr. Gover advised the parties that Canada’s
    undertaking was “satisfactory to the Courts” and no formal order was necessary.
    Even though Canada’s RFD has already been returned and the Order Under Appeal has
    been rendered, counsel for Canada affirmed before me that Canada’s undertaking
    to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice was deemed sufficient for the purpose
    of preserving the documents pending the outcome of these matters.</span></p>
