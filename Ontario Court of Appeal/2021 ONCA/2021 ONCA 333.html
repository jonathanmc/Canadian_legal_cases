  <p class=Judge><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-weight:normal'>On appeal from the verdict of not criminally
    responsible on account of mental disorder entered by Justice David M. Stone of
    the Ontario Court of Justice, dated June 19, 2018.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>By the Court:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 19, 2018 the appellant was found not
    criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (”NCRMD”) at the
    conclusion of proceedings before a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice. He
    appeals that finding on the basis that he did not appreciate the nature of the
    proceedings that resulted in the verdict. In addition, he never intended to
    admit the conduct that formed the basis of the several offences with which he
    was charged or the conclusion of the psychiatrist who conducted the
    court-ordered assessment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the conclusion of the appellant’s
    submissions, we dismissed the appeal. We promised to provide reasons for that
    decision. Those reasons follow.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Background Facts</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a result of a series of events at his
    mother’s home, the appellant was charged with arson, unlawful confinement,
    assault with a weapon, mischief and failure to comply with an undertaking. He
    elected trial by a judge and jury and had a preliminary inquiry.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Preliminary Inquiry</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Over three days, evidence was given about the
    circumstances underlying the offences with which the appellant was charged. His
    mother and brother testified about how the events began and continued before
    and after his mother called 911. The officers who responded to the 911 call
    also gave evidence of their observations and interactions with the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An investigator from the Office of the Fire
    Marshal explained that the fire that occurred at the appellant’s mother’s home
    had been intentionally set. The fire had been started by igniting a mixture of
    methyl alcohol (fondue fuel) and mineral oil (four-stroke motor oil).</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Exit Pre-Trial</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the conclusion of the case for the Crown at
    the preliminary inquiry, Crown counsel advised the presiding judge of the
    counts on which he (Crown counsel) would be seeking committal. The presiding
    judge did not rule on the issue of committal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Crown and defence counsel agreed to conduct an
    exit pre-trial with the preliminary inquiry judge.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Assessment Order</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>After the exit pre-trial concluded, the
    parties returned to the courtroom later the same day. Crown counsel sought an
    order for an assessment report under s. 672.11 of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46</span></em>. The purpose of
    the report was to obtain evidence of whether the appellant was, at the time of
    the commission of the offences charged, suffering from a mental disorder so as
    to be exempt from criminal responsibility under s. 16(1) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>The
    preliminary inquiry judge advised counsel of his provisional conclusions about
    committal. However, counsel did not request, and the judge did not make, any
    formal order of committal or discharge on the counts contained in the
    information.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>On his own
    motion, the preliminary inquiry judge concluded that he had reasonable grounds
    to believe that evidence of the appellant’s mental condition was necessary to
    determine the issue of the appellant’s criminal responsibility for the offences
    charged. The judge remanded the appellant for 60 days to Ontario Shores Centre
    for Mental Health Services so that the assessment could be carried out.</span></em></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Exit Pre-Trial Resumes</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>About two months later, after the parties had
    received and reviewed the Assessment Report from Ontario Shores, they returned
    before the preliminary inquiry judge. They resumed the exit pre-trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the parties returned to the courtroom,
    defence counsel advised the preliminary inquiry judge that he (defence counsel)
    had met with the appellant both before and after the initial exit pre-trial.
    Counsel explained that he had read and discussed the contents of the report
    with the appellant including its conclusion. The appellant, counsel said, was
    aware of the contents of the report and the conclusion of its author, Dr.
    Pytyck. According to counsel, the appellant was willing to acknowledge and
    accept the psychiatrist’s opinion as expressed in her report.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Re-Election</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Through counsel, the appellant indicated he
    wanted to re-elect his mode of trial. Counsel waived re-arraignment and
    indicated the appellant’s wish to be tried in the Ontario Court of Justice
    before the preliminary inquiry judge. The appellant confirmed his wish to
    proceed in this way. The Crown consented to the re-election. The appellant
    entered a plea of not guilty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties agreed that in deciding the case,
    the presiding judge could rely on the evidence adduced at the preliminary
    inquiry together with the synopses that Crown counsel had read into the record.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Positions of the Parties at Trial</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial Crown, relying on the evidence adduced
    at the preliminary inquiry and the content of the synopses, asked the trial
    judge to find the appellant committed the acts that formed the basis of the
    offences on which the judge had indicated he would commit the appellant for
    trial. On the basis of the opinion of the forensic psychiatrist who conducted
    the assessment, the Crown invited the trial judge to find the appellant not
    criminally responsible on account of mental disorder on the affected counts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel made no further submissions.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Decision of the Trial Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In brief reasons, the trial judge found the
    appellant not guilty on two counts. On the remaining counts, the trial judge
    found that the appellant committed the acts that formed the basis of the
    offences, but was at the time suffering from a mental disorder that exempted
    him from criminal responsibility for those offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After entering the special verdict of NCRMD, the
    trial judge declined to conduct a disposition hearing but referred the matter
    to the Ontario Review Board (“ORB”) to hold a disposition hearing. The
    appellant remains under the supervision of the ORB.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Grounds of Appeal </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this court, the appellant advances a single
    ground of appeal. He says that the trial judge erred in failing to ensure that
    the appellant understood the procedure that was being followed and its
    consequences for him. In support of this ground, the appellant relies on
    materials tendered for admission in this court to supplement the trial record.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Failure to Ensure the Appellant’s Understanding of the
    Proceedings</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The single ground of appeal advanced by the
    appellant alleges that a miscarriage of justice occurred because the trial
    judge failed:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>to explain the process of a NCRMD “plea” to the
    appellant; and </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>to conduct an inquiry to ensure that the
    appellant’s admission of the circumstances of the predicate offences was
    voluntary, informed and unequivocal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Some further background is necessary to situate
    this claim of error in its proper setting.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Additional Background</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties have enhanced the trial record with
    affidavit material from the appellant and trial counsel. No issue is raised
    about admissibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant is currently subject to a
    detention order. He is confined to the Forensic Psychiatric Rehabilitation Unit
    at Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Services.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Affidavit of the Appellant</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On at least a dozen occasions between 2004 and
    2017, the appellant was assessed or treated at Lakeridge Health in Oshawa and the
    Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. The diagnoses have varied. Alcohol and
    Substance Abuse Disorder. Depressive Disorder. Antisocial Personality Disorder.
    Narcissistic features. Anger management problems. Schizophrenic Disorder –
    Schizoaffective Type. And most recently, Schizoaffective Disorder – Bipolar
    Subtype. The appellant also believes that he has an acquired brain injury from
    several sports-related concussions. Over two decades ago, he lapsed into a coma
    after a fall.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant says that he did not understand
    that the proceedings after his re-election would result in a finding of NCRMD and
    deprive him of his right to have a trial. He believed that he was remanded to
    Ontario Shores so that he could receive psychiatric treatment and remain fit
    for his trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant cannot recall having received any
    advice from trial counsel about the meaning, process or consequences of a NCRMD
    finding. He felt drowsy and had difficulty following the proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claims he did not intend to accept
    the facts as outlined in the preliminary inquiry or the allegations included in
    the synopses read by Crown counsel after the re-election. He did not intend to
    accept the NCRMD assessment and the conclusions expressed by the examining
    psychiatrist. He did not wish to give up his right to have a trial and to
    testify in his own defence.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Affidavit of Trial Counsel</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel (not counsel on appeal) has
    practiced law for nearly one and one-half decades, including about ten years as
    defence counsel in criminal cases. He assumed carriage of the appellant’s case
    from prior counsel (now counsel on appeal) about two months before the
    preliminary inquiry. He spoke and met with the appellant in advance and on each
    day of the inquiry. The original election had been made and the preliminary
    hearing dates set by previous counsel with whom trial counsel’s associate had
    met. During his meetings with the appellant before and during the preliminary
    inquiry, trial counsel explained what he anticipated would happen in the
    courtroom and assessed the appellant’s condition. Three times during the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the conclusion of the evidence at the
    preliminary inquiry, trial counsel conceded committal on several counts. Crown
    counsel acknowledged that the appellant should be discharged on others. As
    trial counsel had indicated when the preliminary inquiry began, he requested an
    exit pre-trial with the presiding judge. The Crown agreed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the exit pre-trial ended, defence counsel
    met with the appellant. Counsel explained that if the appellant were convicted,
    the Crown would seek a sentence of three to five years, and that the
    preliminary inquiry judge considered a sentence of five years appropriate.
    Counsel advised the appellant of the judge’s opinion about sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel told the appellant that the judge
    was going to order an NCR assessment. Counsel explained that the assessment
    would be done at a hospital. The appellant would meet with doctors who would
    prepare a report for the court. Trial counsel and the appellant had talked
    about “the NCR process” on prior occasions. Counsel pointed out that if the
    appellant were found NCRMD, he (the appellant) would remain in hospital for an
    indeterminate time. His release would be up to the ORB and the appellant’s own
    progress. The appellant agreed to proceed with the NCR assessment, or at least
    did not oppose it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After trial counsel had received the assessment,
    he met with the appellant both before and after the exit pre-trial reconvened
    before the presiding judge. Counsel reviewed the report with the appellant
    focusing on:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he sections entitled “Medications,”
    “Medical History,” “Psychiatric History,” the file information from Lakeridge
    Health, the description of Mr. Anderson’s account of the events, “Functional
    Inquiry,” “Course in Hospital,” “Mental Status Examination” and “Psychiatric
    Opinions and Recommendations.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant seemed to understand the
    contents of the report, including Dr. Pytyck’s conclusions, and that the report
    would be put before the trial judge who would decide whether the appellant
    would be found NCRMD.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel repeated his prior discussions with
    the appellant about the procedure in NCR cases and what would happen were the
    appellant to be found NCRMD and be subject to the supervision of the ORB.
    Counsel explained that if the appellant wished to go ahead with the NCR
    process, his trial in the criminal court would end and his case would be
    transferred to the ORB.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel described his explanation of the
    courtroom procedure in these terms:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I spoke to Mr. Anderson about the procedure
    that would happen in court. I explained to him that if he wanted to accept the
    NCR verdict, we would convert the preliminary inquiry into a trial before
    Justice Stone. We would ask the judge to apply the evidence from the
    preliminary inquiry to the trial along with some additional reports. I said
    that the reports were essentially information that was already before the judge
    because they related to witnesses who had already testified at the preliminary
    inquiry. I explained that we would not dispute that evidence. This meant that
    while he was not admitting the evidence was true, he also would not be offering
    any evidence or argument to contradict it. As a result, the judge would likely
    accept the evidence and base his decision on it.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Psychiatric Report</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Jennifer Pytyck, a forensic psychiatrist at
    Ontario Shores, conducted the court-ordered psychiatric assessment of the
    appellant. She outlined the appellant’s extensive history of psychiatric
    treatment for substance abuse, agitation, aggression, suicidal ideation and
    schizophrenia. In her opinion, the appellant suffered from Schizoaffective
    Disorder – Bipolar Subtype. He displayed significant psychotic symptoms during
    the assessment period.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Pytyck concluded that, at the time of the
    predicate offences, the appellant showed significant symptoms of mania and
    psychosis. He had the delusional belief that his mother and brother were trying
    to steal from, and harm, him. His mother was hiding a secret twin sister. The
    appellant believed he was infested with insects. The appellant acknowledged that
    he was suicidal at the time of the alleged offences, which he denied
    committing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Pytyck explained that, although the
    appellant may have understood the nature and quality of his conduct at the time
    of the offences, he likely lacked the faculty of rational perception with
    respect to his understanding of their wrongfulness.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Arguments on Appeal</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant says that this appeal should be
    decided on the basis of the trial record as amplified by the affidavits filed
    in this court by the appellant and trial counsel. Neither affiant was
    cross-examined. This enhanced record enables this court to evaluate whether the
    appellant understood the nature of the proceedings and knowingly participated
    in them.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before an accused may be found NCRMD, a trial
    court must make a finding that the accused committed the acts that formed the
    basis of the offence charged. Such a finding can only be made on the basis of
    evidence adduced at trial or where the accused admits those acts by pleading
    guilty. Neither happened here.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant points out that when an accused
    pleads guilty, the presiding judge must conduct a plea comprehension inquiry.
    This ensures that the plea is voluntary, informed and unequivocal. No such
    inquiry took place here.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant accepts that in some cases in
    which an accused does not, or cannot, admit that they committed the acts that
    formed the basis of the offences charged, it is common practice for the accused
    to:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>enter a plea of not guilty;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>not contest the factual allegations of the Crown; and</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>make no submissions about or acquiesce in a finding of guilt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>(This procedure enables an accused to
    challenge any pre-trial rulings in this court, something a plea of guilty would
    foreclose.) Although not required in all cases, an inquiry similar to a plea comprehension
    inquiry is required in some, among them this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the appellant continues, he was
    more of a spectator or bystander than a participant in the proceedings that
    resulted in the NCRMD verdict. Nothing akin to a plea comprehension inquiry
    occurred. The proposed course of the proceedings was never explained to him in
    the courtroom. The appellant’s participation was extremely limited. Affirming
    his re-election. Acknowledging his return to Ontario Shores and supervision by
    the ORB <em>after</em> the verdict had been rendered. This despite
    well-documented, longstanding and severe mental health issues. Counsel’s
    inquiries are not a surrogate for the obligations of the trial judge to ensure
    the appellant’s understanding of the procedure followed and its consequences
    for the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent demurs. Although the appellant does
    not contend that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance, his position
    pivots on whether he was properly apprised of the implications of the procedure
    followed and the consequences of a NCRMD verdict. The evidentiary foundation
    for the claim of uninformed participation is that the appellant cannot now
    recall conversations with trial counsel about the procedure to be followed, the
    NCRMD verdict, or its consequences for him. A review of the record of the
    proceedings as enhanced by the affidavit evidence affords no basis for the
    conclusion that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The underlying circumstances, the respondent
    says, belie the claim of uninformed participation. Throughout the three-day
    preliminary inquiry and the NCR proceedings, the appellant exercised several
    procedural and substantive rights. He was represented throughout by counsel
    with whom he had many conversations and discussions before and during the
    preliminary inquiry and before the NCR hearing. The preliminary inquiry
    involved a full preview of the case for the Crown. The witnesses were cross-examined,
    aided by information that could only have been provided by the appellant. As a
    result of exit pre-trials, the appellant was made aware of the strength of the
    case against him, the offences on which he would likely be ordered to stand
    trial, and the likely sentencing disposition were he to be convicted after
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>This is not a case, the respondent
    continues, in which a plea inquiry was required. Absent a plea of guilty, no
    plea comprehension inquiry was required<em><span style='font-style:normal'>.
    Nor did the fact that the appellant did not expressly admit the conduct that
    formed the basis of the offences charged require a plea comprehension inquiry.
    The additional evidence makes it clear that the appellant, who was fit to stand
    trial, had several discussions about the NCR verdict, its consequences for him
    and the procedural steps necessary to achieve that result. That he understood
    the process and its consequences is confirmed by his positive response when the
    verdict had been rendered:</span></em></span></p>

    that their conduct is wrong. It is in these instances, because of an incapacity

    Code </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>describes the pleas available to
    an accused who is called upon to plead. Those pleas are the general pleas of guilty

  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Principles Applied</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As we will explain, we do not give effect to
    this argument. Despite some imperfections in the proceedings, we are satisfied
    that no miscarriage of justice occurred. Nothing that occurred or failed to
    occur compromised the overall fairness of the proceedings or the reliability of
    the NCRMD verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the amplified record in this case plainly
    shows, the appellant was represented throughout by competent defence counsel
    who, in accordance with the appellant’s original election, concluded a full three-day
    preliminary inquiry. The entirety of the case for the Crown was revealed under
    oath. The eyewitnesses. The responding police officers. The investigator from
    the Office of the Fire Marshal. The witnesses were cross-examined. The
    appellant and counsel spoke both prior to and each day of the preliminary inquiry.
    Counsel explained what he anticipated would unfold at each day’s proceedings.
    He also wanted to assess the appellant’s condition, especially in light of the
    appellant’s interruption of the proceedings during the evidence of his mother,
    his brother and a police officer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As he foreshadowed at the outset of the
    preliminary inquiry, defence counsel and Crown counsel jointly requested an
    exit pre-trial with the (then) preliminary inquiry judge. After the initial
    exit pre-trial had been conducted, defence counsel told the appellant that if
    the case proceeded to trial and convictions were recorded, the Crown would seek
    a penitentiary sentence of three to five years. Defence counsel explained that
    the trial judge considered a sentence of five years would be appropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to the discussion about the sentence
    the Crown would seek on conviction after trial, the appellant and counsel
    discussed the NCR process. They had discussed this on prior occasions. Counsel
    explained that the judge was going to order an NCR assessment. This would take
    place in a hospital. The appellant would meet with doctors. The doctors would
    prepare a report for the judge. Counsel pointed out that if he (the appellant)
    were found NCRMD, he would remain at the hospital without a scheduled date for
    release. That release, counsel indicated, would depend on how well the
    appellant did in treatment. That release would be up to the ORB. The appellant
    agreed to proceed with the NCR assessment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the trial judge made the assessment order,
    he explained to the appellant that the assessment was for the purpose of
    deciding whether the appellant was exempt from criminal responsibility for the
    offences with which he was charged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel received the assessment report before
    the exit pre-trial resumed. He met with the appellant both before and after the
    exit pre-trial. He reviewed the report by summarizing the relevant portions
    including the “Mental Status Examination” and “Psychiatric Opinions and Recommendations”.
    The appellant appeared to understand the contents of the report, and that the
    report would be put before the judge and relied upon by him to decide whether
    he (the appellant) should be found NCRMD.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel repeated the discussions he and the
    appellant had earlier had about the NCR process. Counsel explained what would
    happen to the appellant when he came under the authority of the ORB. Counsel
    told the appellant that if he wished to go ahead with the NCRMD process, his
    trial in the criminal court would be over. His case would be transferred to the

lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel elaborated on what would happen in the
    courtroom if he wished to pursue the NCRMD process. The preliminary inquiry
    would be converted into a trial. The judge would be asked to apply the evidence
    given at the preliminary inquiry, along with some additional information. Defence
    counsel would not dispute that evidence. This meant that although the appellant
    would not be admitting that the evidence was true, he would not be offering any
    evidence or argument to contradict it. The judge would likely accept that
    evidence and base his decision on it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In their discussion, the appellant and counsel
    also spoke about the option of a trial. Counsel would have explained the
    appellant’s right to have a trial but also advised the appellant that he did
    not see any viable defence arising out of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In counsel’s view, the appellant understood his
    choices of trial and NCRMD. The appellant seemed engaged in the conversation
    with counsel and indicated that he wished to proceed along the path to a NCRMD verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When proceedings resumed in the courtroom,
    defence counsel indicated that the appellant wished “to avail himself of the
    NCR finding and proceed in that fashion today”. In answer to a question from
    the presiding judge, defence counsel indicated that the appellant would </span><span
lang=EN-CA>acknowledge and accept</span><span lang=EN-CA> the contents and
    conclusions of the psychiatric report which counsel had reviewed and discussed
    with the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant confirmed defence counsel’s
    statement that he (the appellant) wished to have his case dealt with that day
    by the presiding judge. Defence counsel entered a plea of not guilty. The Crown
    asked that the trial judge consider the evidence that he had heard when
    presiding over the preliminary inquiry. Crown counsel then read a summary of
    the evidence of various witnesses who had testified at the preliminary inquiry
    and filed the psychiatric report prepared by Dr. Pytyck on the basis of the
    assessment order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel indicated that he did not
    dispute the evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry or the additional
    allegations of the Crown. The defence called no evidence and made no
    submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In brief reasons, the trial judge indicated his acceptance
    of the evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry and the additional reports
    read in by Crown counsel. He found the appellant not guilty on two counts and
    entered acquittals. On the remaining counts, the trial judge found the
    underlying facts established to the standard of proof required, but that the
    appellant was not criminally responsible for that conduct on account of mental
    disorder.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As proceedings concluded, the following exchange
    occurred:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>THE COURT: So, the upshot of this is that you
    will be returned to the Ontario Shores facility, is that correct?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[DEFENCE COUNSEL]: That’s my understanding,
    Your Honour.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>THE COURT:  Okay.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[CROWN COUNSEL]:  Yes, sir.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>THE COURT: That was mine as well, and they
    will work with you there until such time as the Ontario Review Board reviews
    and disposes of your matter. That means that you will not ever have to face a
    judge and jury trial, this matter will be effectively concluded as far as this
    Court is concerned and I will be turning you over in effect to the Ontario
    Review Board.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I heard some very interesting evidence in this
    case, Mr. Anderson, I hope you are able to apply yourself to some of the things
    that were said in the report by Dr. Pytyck and hopefully we will not see you
    back in a place like this.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>ANDERSON:  No, that’d be great.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>THE COURT:  Any questions, Sir?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>ANDERSON:  No, Sir. No, Your Honour, I’m okay.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the appellant was charged with
    several offences alleged to have been committed at his mother’s home in the
    presence of his mother and brother. Police responded to a 911 call made by the
    appellant’s mother and witnessed some of the alleged offences as they
    continued. On the evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry, which formed
    part of the record on which the verdict was rendered, no viable defence
    emerged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>No issue was raised about the appellant’s
    fitness to stand trial. He was represented by the same counsel throughout the
    proceedings with which we are concerned. The preliminary inquiry. The exit
    pre-trials. The order of an assessment to determine criminal responsibility.
    The re-election of mode of trial. The procedure to be followed. The
    consequences of that procedure. No claim of ineffective assistance is advanced.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant says that he did not understand
    that the hearing before the trial judge would result in a NCRMD finding without
    a trial. He did not intend to accept the facts based on the evidence adduced at
    the preliminary inquiry and the additional summary read by the Crown. Nor did
    he intend to accept Dr. Pytyck’s assessment and conclusion. He claimed an
    inability to recall any advice by trial counsel about the meaning, process or
    repercussions of a NCRMD finding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel paints a very different picture.
    He and the appellant met and discussed the case before, during and after the
    preliminary inquiry during which the entirety of the case for the Crown was
    disclosed. Counsel also apprised the appellant of the discussions at the exit
    pre-trials. The sentencing position of the Crown and the judge — on conviction,
    a penitentiary sentence of three to five years — was also discussed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During discussions about the exit pre-trials,
    defence counsel explained that the judge intended to remand the appellant to a
    hospital for a psychiatric assessment of the appellant’s criminal responsibility.
    This issue was not new for counsel and client. They had previous discussions
    about it. The appellant raised no issue about the process to him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When counsel received the assessment report, he
    reviewed its significant features with the appellant and explained the NCRMD
    procedure and its consequences for the appellant. The appellant decided what he
    wanted to do.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The affidavit of trial counsel satisfies us that
    when proceedings resumed in the courtroom after completion of the exit
    pre-trials, the appellant was sufficiently aware of the options available to
    him about how the case would proceed. He was acquainted with the NCR process,
    the likelihood of a NCRMD verdict and its consequences of hospitalization and
    supervision by the ORB. Indeed, some of these aspects had been reiterated in
    open court. He participated in the re-election of mode of trial and accepted
    entry of a plea of not guilty, both features that counsel had previously
    explained to him. He was not required to abandon his prior disavowal of the
    underlying events or the diagnosis or conclusion of Dr. Pytyck, as would have
    been the case had he entered a plea of guilty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge was not required to conduct a
    plea comprehension inquiry under s. 606(1.1) in the absence of a plea of
    guilty. Although it would have been preferable had the trial judge satisfied
    himself by inquiry of the appellant at the outset that the appellant was aware
    of the nature and effect of the proposed procedure, the affidavit of trial
    counsel satisfies us that the appellant’s participation was voluntary, informed
    and unequivocal. The appellant’s subsequent colloquy with the trial judge
    confirms as much.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nothing that occurred or failed to occur in the
    trial proceedings rendered those proceedings unfair or the NCRMD verdict
    unreliable.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Disposition</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
