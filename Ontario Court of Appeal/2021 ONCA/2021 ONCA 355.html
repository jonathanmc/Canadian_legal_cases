  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the close of the appellant’s submissions, we
    did not call on the respondent and dismissed the appeal with reasons to follow.
    These are our reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant met the respondent’s family in
    2013. In February 2015, when he was 26 and she was 20, the appellant contacted
    the respondent by Facebook messenger and made a marriage proposal. The
    respondent declined the proposal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge found that in June 2018 the
    appellant “returned to the topic of marriage and suggested that he was still
    waiting for her”. In October 2018 the respondent blocked the appellant on
    WhatsApp, a messaging platform, and asked him not to communicate with her except
    in regard to their mutual volunteer activity with Muslim Awards for Excellence
    (“MAX”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In December 2018, the respondent became engaged
    to her long-term partner. On January 24, 2019, the appellant sent the
    respondent a lengthy email, telling her he had “developed severe hatred” for her
    and her mother over the “past few months”. He said he “had continuous negative
    thoughts” against both of them, which he “could not control.” He attributed
    this to someone linked to the respondent and her mother doing black magic on him.
    Over time he “started developing severe hatred for [the respondent and her
    mother], without understanding why, and this kept on growing to the point [he]
    felt like fighting with [the respondent and her mother], cutting off
    communication.” The appellant claimed that the respondent and her mother had
    been “equally influenced with Black Magic”. The appellant imputed the
    respondent’s attachment to her fiancé to the influence of black magic. Black
    magic got her “to the point where [she could not] resist getting close to [her
    fiancé] and getting married”.  The appellant went on to accuse the respondent’s
    fiancé of casting a black magic spell on the respondent by feeding her
    ingredients he had obtained from Bangladesh. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This email prompted the respondent to confide in
    Dr. Ahmed, the chair of MAX, and correspond with MAX’s Board about her concerns
    about the appellant in January 2019. The appellant commenced an action in
    defamation on August 2019 based on the complaint. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent then successfully brought a
    motion to have the action dismissed pursuant to s. 137.1 of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (the anti-SLAPP provision). The
    legislation is intended, as it states, to encourage individuals to express
    themselves on matters of public interest, to promote broad participation in
    debates on matters of public interest, to discourage the use of litigation as a
    means of unduly limiting expression on matters of public interest, and to
    reduce the risk that participation by the public in debates on matters of
    public interest will be hampered by fear of legal action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge found first that the respondent
    met her onus to show the impugned expression related to a matter of public
    interest under s. 137.1(3). He then found the appellant had established his
    action had substantial merit as required by s. 137.1 (4)(a)(i) in that the respondent’s
    words could be found to be defamatory. However, he concluded the appellant had
    failed to establish the respondent had no valid defence as required by s. 137.1
    (4)(a)(ii). He found the respondent could establish the defence of
    justification as her comments were substantially true, that the defence of fair
    comment was established, and that all the elements of the defence of qualified
    privilege were satisfied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeals the dismissal of his defamation action
    against the respondent. </p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>issues</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant raises three issues on appeal:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>1.</span><span lang=EN-CA>   the motion judge engaged in a one-sided
    consideration of the facts;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.</span><span lang=EN-CA>   the motion judge erred
    in his application of the test applicable to motions under s. 137.1 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>3.</span><span lang=EN-CA>   the motion judge erred in awarding the respondent
    full indemnity costs and s. 137.1(9) damages.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>analysis</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The findings of fact</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As we explained to the in-person appellant, this
    court does not revisit the findings of fact made by the court below absent
    palpable and overriding error. In this case, the motion judge’s findings were
    fully supported by the record. It is worthwhile summarizing the motion judge’s
    most relevant findings of fact.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After reviewing the entire record, consisting of
    the parties’ affidavits, the transcripts of the parties’ cross examinations on
    those affidavits, the email and chat communications filed by the parties,
    transcripts of recorded conversations, and the respondent’s correspondence with
    the board of MAX, the trial judge found as a fact that the appellant “pursued
    [the respondent] romantically even though she had made it absolutely clear that
    she was not interested in him, that she had a partner, was engaged, and had
    blocked his messages.” The appellant’s persistent and frustrated romantic
    attachment to the respondent provides the proper context for the motion judge’s
    decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Because of the appellant’s persistence the
    respondent had blocked him on WhatsApp and other social media in October 2018.
    Before us, he pointed out that he had complied with her wish not to contact her
    until he sent her the January 24, 2019 email. The fact he respected her request
    for a time does not undermine the motion judge’s finding that he “once again
    contacted [the respondent] about a personal matter after she repeatedly asked
    him to stop doing so.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A significant finding of fact is that the
    appellant brought his defamation action in bad faith and for an improper
    purpose. The motion judge specifically found as a fact that the appellant
    “commenced his defamation claim to punish [the respondent] for complaining to
    MAX about him, and to intimidate her in case she planned on going further.” The
    motion judge characterized the appellant’s defamation action as a “reprisal”. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application of the Anti-SLAPP test</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>1704604
    Ontario Ltd.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Pointes Protection Association</i>, 2020 SCC 22 (<i>Pointes
    Protection Association</i>)<i> </i>was released after the motion judge’s
    decision, it did not change the test on an anti-SLAPP motion that the motion
    judge applied. </span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The expression was in the public interest</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge identified the impugned
    expression as the respondent’s correspondence with the MAX’s Board. Before us,
    the appellant insisted the respondent’s initial conversation with Dr. Ahmed
    constitutes the defamatory expression. Whether one or the other or both does
    not matter in the legal analysis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge found that complaint related to
    the character and integrity of mentors in the volunteer organization related to
    the public interest. He stated that “the question of ‘volunteer suitability’
    particularly in the mentorship context is what underpins the public interest
    aspect of the impugned expression.” He noted that the respondent’s expression
    related to “both her private and personal interest in protecting herself, her
    fiancé and her family, and her broader responsibility to caution and protect
    other volunteers, particularly young female mentees, in the MAX community.” It
    was in the public interest that the respondent’s concerns about the appellant
    “were more widely known”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Put a little differently, we understand the
    motion judge to have found it is in the public interest that persons working
    with a volunteer organization be able to complain to the organization about
    personal harassment by another volunteer. In our view, MAX was mistaken to
    regard the respondent’s expression to its Special Committee as relating to a
    private and personal matter. MAX had the duty to provide an environment to its
    volunteers that was free from harassment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Whether the respondent’s complaint to MAX had
    merit is not relevant at this initial stage of the analysis. As the Supreme
    Court said at para. 28 of <i>Pointes Protection Association</i>, it is not
    legally relevant whether the expression is “desirable or deleterious, valuable
    or vexatious” or “whether it helps or hampers the public interest”, as long as
    it pertains to a matter of public interest.  The making of a complaint of
    harassment to those in charge of the environment in which it has allegedly
    occurred is a matter of public interest. </span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The action had substantial merit</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that the respondent’s
    communications with MAX about the appellant could be found to be defamatory in
    that they amounted to alleging he had consistently harassed her, gave her
    concern to fear for her safety, and alleged he was unstable. </span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent had valid defences</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge then turned to consider whether
    the appellant had established that the respondent had no valid defence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He first considered the defence of
    justification. It is at this stage that it would be relevant if a complaint of
    harassment were false. In this case the motion judge found the respondent’s
    comments were “substantially true”. The appellant had not met his burden of
    showing the defence of justification would not succeed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge also found the defence of fair
    comment could be made out. The respondent was “advising MAX about her reaction
    to receiving the disturbing ‘black magic’ email” from the appellant, and
    providing comment about a “volunteer who has a demonstrated unprofessional and
    unstable conduct”. Another person, as the motion judge found, could honestly
    express the same opinion on the facts. The motion judge also found the
    respondent’s complaint was not made in malice but rather was a “measured”
    response to his “black magic” email. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, the motion judge found that the defence
    of qualified privilege could apply. He found that the respondent had a “social
    and moral duty to furnish information to MAX given [the appellant’s] mentor
    status” and that she was acting in good faith when she submitted her complaint
    to MAX.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> set the threshold for assessing whether the appellant demonstrated
    reasonable grounds that no valid defence exists. Under <i>Pointes Protection
    Association</i>, the appellant would have had to show that none of the defences
    have a “real prospect of success”. This standard, established after the motion
    was heard, has no effect on appeal as the motion judge found it clear that the
    defences “would succeed”.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The harm did not outweigh the public interest</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge recognized his findings thus
    far were sufficient to dismiss the appellant’s action. However, he went on to
    consider whether the harm suffered by the appellant outweighed the public
    interest in protecting the respondent’s expression. He said there was little
    convincing evidence the appellant had suffered damages, and found the
    appellant’s own conduct may have contributed to a chill and his relations with
    MAX.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge had earlier found that the
    respondent’s expression had been made in good faith, without malice, and in the
    public interest. On the other hand, the motion judge found that the appellant
    brought this defamation action in bad faith and for an improper purpose to
    punish the respondent. While he made these findings in the context of applying
    s. 137.1(9) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> they are most relevant at this
    stage. The public interest will not be served by allowing a defamation action
    to proceed that was brought in bad faith for the purpose of punishing a person
    who has made a good faith complaint of harassment in a common volunteering
    environment.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The damages award</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 137.1(9) provides that the motion judge
    may award the defendant damages if the plaintiff brought the defamation action
    “in bad faith or for an improper purpose”. The motion judge exercised this jurisdiction
    to award the respondent $10,000 in damages. He cited this court’s decision in <em>United
    Soils Management Ltd. v. Mohammed</em>, 2019 ONCA 128<i> </i>for the
    proposition that such an award was appropriate where the “action has been
    brought in bad faith or for an improper motive, such as punishing, silencing or
    intimidating the defendant rather than any legitimate pursuit of a legal
    remedy”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The record before the motion judge provided
    ample support for his finding the appellant brought the action in this case in
    bad faith motivated by the improper motive of punishing, silencing or
    intimidating the respondent. He pointed out there was little need to pursue a
    legitimate legal remedy as the &quot;confidential nature of MAX’s investigation
    conducted by a Special Committee insulated him from reputational harm” and that
    investigation concluded he could continue as a volunteer with MAX. The record
    also discloses that the appellant threatened the respondent with legal action a
    day after he sent the black magic email and MAX had advised him not to attend
    an event. Days later he threatened the respondent’s mother with legal action. The
    motion judge also referred to the &quot;particularly disturbing threat&quot;
    the appellant made that, if his claim were dismissed, he would file complaints
    against her with the University of Toronto, medical boards, hospitals, and the
    College of Family Physicians of Canada. </span></p>

    motion judge's characterization of the appellant’s defamation action as a “reprisal”
    and his award of damages under s. 137.1(9).</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 137.1(7) creates a presumption that a
    party who succeeds in having an action dismissed under the section is entitled

lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent sought full indemnity costs. She
    submits that the policy rationale of the anti-SLAPP provision and particularly
    its presumption that a moving party is entitled to full indemnity costs should
    be applied on appeal. A party whose action was not brought to vindicate a bona
    fide claim, but in bad faith to punish, silence, or intimidate the defendant should
    face a disincentive to persisting to advance their improper purpose by
    appealing after their action has been dismissed. As well, the moving party
    should be awarded full indemnity costs on appeal to fulfil the policy rationale
    of 137.1(7).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Without endorsing the respondent’s submission
    in general, costs on a higher scale are appropriate in this case because of the
    motion judge’s finding that the appellant’s defamation claim was a reprisal
    brought to punish and intimidate the respondent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was provided with the respondent’s
    bill for full indemnity costs in the amount of $28,000 and partial indemnity
    costs in the amount of $17,000, but did not make submissions on them. In our
    view, a costs order in the amount of $25,000 is fair and appropriate in the
    circumstances.</span></p>
