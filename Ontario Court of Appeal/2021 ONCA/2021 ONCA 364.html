  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>I.        OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants, Celine and Richard Pizale, owned
    a partially-renovated residential property on Lyndhurst Avenue in Toronto (the
    “Property”). In June 2020 the first mortgagee, Hillmount Capital Inc.
    (“Hillmount”), applied for an order appointing the respondent, Zeifman Partners
    Inc., as receiver of the Property (the “Receiver”). Koehnen J. granted such an
    order on June 19, 2020 (the “Appointment Order”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Receiver marketed the Property on an “as is”
    basis and entered into an agreement of purchase and sale with Patricia and
    David Armstrong (the “Purchasers”). By orders dated January 8, 2021, Conway J.
    granted a sale approval and vesting order (the “Approval Order”), together with
    an administration order approving the Receiver’s activities, as well as
    increasing its borrowing authority to $250,000.00 (the “Administration Order”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 15, 2021, the Pizales filed a notice
    of appeal of the Motion Judge’s January 8 orders. Two motions then ensued
    before the Chambers Judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the Receiver moved for orders (i)
    declaring that the Pizales do not have an automatic right of appeal under ss.
    193(a)-(d) <a name="_Hlk66975227">of the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency&nbsp;Act</em>,
    R.S.C., 1985, c. B-3 (the “<em>BIA</em>”), </a>and (ii) denying them leave to
    appeal the Approval and Administration Orders under <em>BIA</em> s. 193(e).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Pizales then brought a motion for (i) a
    declaration that they have a right to appeal to this court from the Approval and
    Administration Orders under s.&nbsp;193(c), which states that an appeal lies to
    the Court of Appeal “if the property involved in the appeal exceeds in value
    ten thousand dollars,” or (ii) alternatively, leave to appeal the orders
    pursuant to s. 193(e) and a stay of the Approval and Administration Orders
    pending their appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By order dated February 4, 2021 the Chambers
    Judge declared that the Pizales did not have an automatic right of appeal and
    denied them leave to appeal (the “Chambers Order”). He ordered that the sale of
    the Property should proceed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Pizales thereupon brought an urgent panel
    review motion pursuant to s. 7(5) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. C.43 (“<em>CJA</em>”), to set aside the Chambers Order and, if
    necessary, stay the Approval and Administration Orders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The panel heard the motion on February 8, 2021,
    the day scheduled for the closing of the sale of the Property. At the
    conclusion of the hearing the panel dismissed the Pizales’ motion, with reasons
    to follow. These are those reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>II.       BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Property and the receivership</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Pizales were in the process of renovating
    the Property when Hillmount, the first mortgagee, applied for the appointment
    of a receiver. At the time, there were four mortgages registered against the
    Property: (i) the first mortgage to Hillmount for approximately $3.35 million,
    later assigned to Elle Mortgage Corporation (“Elle”); (ii) an $800,000 second
    mortgage to 1713691 Ontario Inc. and Boris Nodel; (iii) a third mortgage for
    $569,359 to Harold Wine, Gad Caro, and Marshall Morris; and (iv) a $325,000
    fourth mortgage to Weihao Zhang. The Pizales had been in default under the
    first mortgage for a number of months prior to the Receiver’s appointment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appointment Order authorized the Receiver to
    take possession of the Property, preserve, market, and sell it. The Receiver
    was authorized to borrow up to $150,000 from Hillmount. Given the significant
    costs required to complete the renovation of the Property, the limited
    borrowing authority given to the Receiver clearly indicated that its mandate
    under the Appointment Order was to sell the Property on an “as is” basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As described by the Motion Judge in her
    endorsement, the Receiver initially listed the Property for sale at $4.8
    million, which was higher than the appraisals it had obtained for a sale on an
    “as is” basis. Notwithstanding numerous showings of the Property, that listing
    price did not attract any offers. In mid-September 2020, the Receiver reduced
    the listing price to $4.15 million. Several offers were received, which the
    Receiver pursued. The Receiver entered into a Sale Agreement with the
    Purchasers for a purchase price that was higher than its two “as is” appraisals
    and any other offers received by the Receiver.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The decision of the Motion Judge</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Receiver moved for court approval of the
    Sale Agreement. In its Second Report, the Receiver stated that if the Sale
    Agreement was not approved, it did not believe it would be able to sell the
    Property for an equal or higher price.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Pizales opposed the Receiver’s motion. They
    wanted to regain possession of the Property, complete the renovations, and sell
    it for an “as complete” or “as renovated” price. The second mortgagees also
    opposed the sale. Elle, the assignee of the first mortgage, and the third and
    fourth mortgagees opposed any sale of the Property but supported a discharge of
    the Receiver. Notwithstanding those positions, no motion to discharge the
    Receiver was brought before the Motion Judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Motion Judge approved the Sale Agreement,
    concluding that the evidence showed the proposed sale satisfied the principles
    set out in <em>Royal Bank&nbsp;v. Soundair Corp.</em> (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 1(C.A.).
    She rejected the submissions made in opposition to the sale stating, at para.
    26 of her endorsement:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It was only after the Sale Agreement was
    entered into that the mortgagees (after making certain arrangements with the
    Respondents) joined forces to mount a coordinated opposition to the [Approval
    and Vesting Order]. Their reasons for doing so are not apparent on the face of
    the record and consist only of a stated opposition. The mortgagees and
    Respondents failed to engage in the court-authorized receivership and sales
    process at any time prior to the signing of the Sale Agreement. The Receiver,
    after conducting a legitimate and proper sales process, entered into an
    agreement with the Purchasers, which the mortgagees and Respondents are now seeking
    to have this court reject. They are seeking to prevent the sale altogether. I
    have considered and weighed the interests of all parties and find that there is
    no basis for this court to allow the objections of the mortgagees and
    Respondents to prevent the Receiver from concluding its agreement with the
    Purchasers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Motion Judge also granted the Administration
    Order, which was unopposed save for the Receiver’s fees and disbursements, for
    which the Receiver intended to seek approval at a later date.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The decision of the Chambers Judge</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Pizales submitted to the Chambers Judge that
    their appeal fell within <em>BIA</em> s. 193(c). The Chambers Judge noted that
    the Pizales accepted the jurisprudence summarized in the chambers decision in <em>2403177
    Ontario Inc. v. Bending Lake Iron Group Limited</em>, 2016 ONCA 225, 347 O.A.C.
    226 (“<em>Bending Lake</em>”),</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=EN-CA> that <em>BIA</em> s. 193(c) does not apply to orders that: are procedural in nature; do not bring
    into play the value of the debtor’s property; or do not result in a loss. The
    Chambers Judge concluded that the Pizales’ appeal did not fall within <em>BIA</em> s.&nbsp;193(c) for three reasons: (i) the Pizales’ critiques of the Approval
    Order all related to the manner in which the Property was sold and therefore
    concerned matters of procedure that did not give rise to an automatic right of
    appeal; (ii) the Pizales’ appeal did not bring into play the value of the
    Property; and (iii) the Approval Order would not result in a loss. The Chambers
    Judge rejected the Pizales’ argument that an automatic right of appeal lay in
    respect of the Administration Order for the same reasons he rejected the
    argument for the Approval Order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Chambers Judge then concluded that the
    Pizales should not be granted leave to appeal under <em>BIA</em> s. 193(e). He
    did not regard their appeal as raising an issue of general importance to the
    practice in bankruptcy/insolvency matters or the administration of justice as a
    whole. Instead, it was “an attempt to relitigate a dispute between the Pizales
    and the receiver that will have little importance to bankruptcy/insolvency
    matters beyond the parties.” Nor did the Chambers Judge view the Pizales’
    appeal as <em>prima facie</em> meritorious. He found the Motion Judge’s <em>Soundair</em> analysis to be “complete and the grounds do not raise a serious issue to be
    appealed.” Finally, the Chambers Judge held that granting leave would risk
    losing the sale to the Purchasers, thereby placing into question the whole
    integrity of the sales process.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>III.      THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On a panel review of the order of a single judge
    pursuant to <em>CJA</em> s. 7(5), the panel may interfere with the order if the
    chambers judge failed to identify the applicable principles, erred in principle
    or reached an unreasonable result: <em>DeMarco v. Nicoletti</em>, 2017 ONCA
    417, at para. 3; <em>Yaiguaje v. Chevron Corporation</em>, 2017 ONCA 827, 138
    O.R. (3d) 1, at para. 21; <em>Struik v. Dixie Lee Food Systems Ltd.</em>, 2018
    ONCA 22, at paras. 5-6.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>IV.     THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE REVIEW
    MOTION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On this motion to review, the Pizales advance
    three main arguments to set aside the Chambers Decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, they contend the Chambers Judge erred by
    applying the legal principles concerning <em>BIA</em> s. 193(c) in a too
    restrictive or narrow way.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the Pizales submit that the Chambers
    Judge misconstrued their arguments about why they had an automatic right of
    appeal under <em>BIA</em> s. 193(c). They were not alleging improvident sale or
    an improper sale process. Instead, they were alleging that the receivership was
    “spent” so there was no need to liquidate the Property. In their submission,
    the purpose of the receivership was achieved when Hillmount, the applicant
    creditor, was made whole and assigned its first mortgage to Elle. According to
    the Pizales, given that assignment the Motion Judge should have given more
    weight to the objections to the sale by the Pizales and remaining creditors.
    Instead, the Approval Order wrongfully preferred preserving the integrity of
    the sales process over the substantive interests of the Pizales and their
    creditor mortgagees.</span></p>

    the differences between the operative principles described in <em>Wilkes </em>and
    the case law summarized and categorized in <em>Bending Lake</em>.</span></p>

    that a court’s primary task when examining whether an automatic right of appeal
    exists is to answer the question raised by s. 193(c) “and determine whether the
    property involved in the appeal exceeds $10,000.” Writing for the court,
    Jackson J.A. continued, at para. 61:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Courts have used different ways of giving
    meaning to s. 193(c), but it is still the words of the statute that govern.
    Thus, in <em>Fallis</em>, by its adoption of what the Court had said in <em>Orpen</em>,
    the test is stated as, <a name="_Hlk71716637">What is the loss which the
    granting or refusing of the right claimed will entail? </a>In <em>Fogel</em>,
    the Court asked what is “the value in jeopardy” (at para 6). In <em>McNeil</em>,
    the Chambers judge observed that “[t]he ‘property involved in the appeal’ … may
    be determined by comparing the order appealed against the remedy sought in the
    notice of appeal” (at para 13). In <em>Trimor</em>, the Chambers judge added to
    the <em>Orpen–Fallis</em> test by stating “[t]he focus of the inquiry under s.
    193(c) is the amount of money at stake …” (at para 10). All of these
    expressions are consistent with the statutory language present in s. 193(c).</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As mentioned above at para. 25, <em>Bending Lake</em> summarized the case law as identifying three types of orders that do not fall
    within the ambit of <em>BIA</em> s. 193(c). The first type the case law
    identifies is an order that does not result in a loss, as described in the <em>Orpen</em> and <em>Fallis</em> cases, which were the focus of the court’s analysis in <em>Wilkes</em>.
    The need for an order to result in a loss to fall within s. 193(c) was framed
    slightly differently by the Alberta Court of Appeal in <em>Re Bearcat
    Exploration Ltd. (Bankrupt)</em>, 2003 ABCA 365, 339 A.R. 376, where the court
    stated, at para. 10, that an appeal under <em>BIA</em> s. 193(c) “must in
    substance be about the value of the property, not just any claim related to
    bankruptcy.” Or, as put by panels of this court in <em>Enroute Imports</em> and <em>Courtice Auto Wreckers</em>, the appeal must “directly involve” property
    exceeding $10,000 in value.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    falling outside of s. 193(c): those that do not bring into play the value of
    the debtor’s property; and those that are procedural in nature. Excluding those
    types of orders from the ambit of s. 193(c) is consistent with – and indeed
    flows logically from – the loss principle articulated in the <em>Orpen/Fallis</em> cases.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By its nature the second type of order - one that
    does not bring into play the value of the debtor’s property - would not result
    in a loss or put property value in jeopardy. For example, it is well-established
    in the <em>BIA</em> s. 193(c) jurisprudence that an order appointing a receiver
    or interim receiver usually does not bring into play the value of the debtor’s
    property as it simply appoints an officer of the court to preserve and monetize
    those assets subject to court approval.</span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"

    no right of appeal under s. 193(c) from a question involving procedure <em>alone</em>”:
    at para. 61 (emphasis in original). Indeed, a few months after the release of <em>Wilkes</em>,
    Jackson J.A., sitting as a chambers judge, concluded in <em>Re Harmon
    International Industries Inc.</em>, 2020 SKCA 95, 81 C.B.R. (6th) 1, that leave
    was required to appeal a receiver’s sale process order stating, at paras.
    34-35:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, what the Court has before it is an Order
    that authorizes a <i>list price</i> of $3.8 million for the Millar Avenue
    Building. It does not propose a sale price of $3.8 million. <span
class=Underline>All that the Order does is establish a process for the sale of
    the property.</span> Any proposed sale must still be confirmed.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>At this point, the claim
    of loss is without any foundation at all. It is, as such, entirely speculative</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>. It assumes that the listing agent will not market the property to
    its fullest potential or that the receiver will place an improvident sale
    before the Court of Queen’s Bench to be confirmed and the Court will confirm
    it. It is possible that Harmon will apply to Elson J. under s. 185(7) of the <i>BIA</i> or wait until it is determined that the property is proposed to be sold for
    less than what Harmon believes it is worth and place the Brunsdon Appraisal
    before Elson J. at that time. It is also possible that Harmon will obtain other
    financing so as to permit it to buy the property at the list price or the
    property will sell for an amount acceptable to Harmon. In my view, <span
class=Underline>the Order does not directly have an impact on the proprietary
    or monetary interests of Harmon or crystallize any loss at this time. It
    concerns a matter of procedure only. It is merely an order as to manner of
    sale, as was the case in </span><span class=EmphasisUnderlineChar>Dominion
    Foundry Co. (Re)</span> (1965), 52 DLR (2d) 79 (Man CA). <span class=Underline>No
    value is in jeopardy, and no party can claim a loss as a result.</span> In my
    view, the property involved in the proposed appeal does not exceed in value
    $10,000 as those words are used in s. 193(c) of the <em>BIA</em>. Thus, I
    conclude it was necessary for Harmon to apply for leave to appeal. (Emphasis
    added.)</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, <em>Wilkes</em> makes an additional
    point. Merely because the question in issue is procedural does not necessarily
    mean there is not property value involved in the appeal that exceeds $10,000.
    Section 193(c) requires a court to analyze the economic effect of the order
    sought to be appealed: at paras. 62-63.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree. What is required in any consideration
    of whether the appeal of an order falls within <em>BIA</em> s. 193(c) is a
    critical examination of the effect of the order sought to be appealed. Such an
    examination requires scrutinizing the grounds of appeal that are advanced in
    respect of the order made below, the reasons the lower court gave for the
    order, and the record that was before it. The inquiry into the effect of the
    order under appeal therefore is a fact-specific one; it is also an
    evidence-based inquiry, which involves more than merely accepting any bald
    allegations asserted in a notice of appeal: <em>Bending Lake</em>, at para. 64. <em>Wilkes</em> concurs on this point, holding, at para. 64, that the loss
    claimed must be “sufficiently grounded in the evidence to the satisfaction of
    the Court determining whether there is a right of appeal,” a point repeated in
    the subsequent chambers decision in <em>Re Harmon International Industries</em>,

    fact-specific, evidence-based critical scrutiny of the effect of the order
    sought to be appealed should foster the remedial objectives of Canada’s

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Conclusion</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Pizales’ contention that the Chambers Judge
    erred by applying too restrictive an approach to s. 193(c) is based on a
    dichotomy in the case law that is more illusory than real, more semantic than
    substantive. While the cases under s. 193(c) have explained the interpretative
    task using differing language (as is to be expected in a body of jurisprudence
    under a national statute), at their core the cases share common ground in
    attempting to discern the operative effect of the order sought to be appealed:
    does the order result in a loss or gain, or put in jeopardy value of property,
    in excess of $10,000?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Chambers Judge identified the applicable
    legal principles. I see no basis to interfere with his decision on that ground.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span
lang=EN-CA>VI.     SECOND ISSUE: DID THE CHAMBERS JUDGE MISAPPREHEND THE
    PIZALES’ KEY ARGUMENTS?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I shall now consider the Pizales’ submission
    that the Chambers Judge misapprehended the key elements of their arguments. The
    Pizales advance two main arguments:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Chambers Judge erred in holding that as a result of the Approval
    Order they had not suffered a loss of greater than $10,000; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Chambers Judge misapprehended their
    principal ground of appeal, which is not based on allegations of an improvident
    sale or improper sale process but rather based on a failure of the Motion Judge
    to properly weigh the interests of the creditors and debtor, favouring process
    in so doing. As part of this submission the Pizales contend that the
    receivership was “spent” upon Hillmount’s assignment of its first mortgage to
    Elle, which meant that there was no need for a sale of the Property.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The “loss” argument</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Pizales are not arguing that since the
    Property is worth more than $10,000, a “loss” of greater than that amount is
    established for purposes of <em>BIA</em> s.&nbsp;193(c). Instead, they submit
    that appraisals showed they had equity in the Property greater than $10,000 when
    the Property was valued on an “as complete” basis. The Receiver’s sale
    jeopardized that equity and approval of the sale would increase their liability
    exposure to their mortgagees as compared to a sale on an “as complete” basis. As
    they submitted in their factums: the Approval Order entails a loss of their
    rights to retain the Property as its value increases and sell it when the
    renovations are complete if they so choose (Jan. 19 factum, para. 53); what
    they want to do is retain ownership of the Property (Jan. 25 factum, para. 7).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Chambers Judge understood the Pizales’
    argument. At para. 26 of his reasons he wrote: “As I understand this argument,
    if the renovations were completed, they could achieve a higher price for the
    home and the gap between what the receiver is selling the house for and what
    could be obtained if the Pizales were permitted to finish the renovation would
    represent the loss.” He rejected the submission that the Approval Order would
    result in a loss to the Pizales, concluding that the “motion judge made strong
    findings that the receiver did not act improvidently.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not regard the Chambers Judge’s conclusion
    as one based on an error in principle or an unreasonable result.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Central to the Pizales’ submission is their
    assertion that selling the Property in a renovated state would fetch a higher
    sales price. The evidence before the Motion Judge and Chambers Judge strongly
    indicated that such would be the case. But, for the purposes of a s. 193(c)
    analysis, that is neither here nor there. That is because the parameters of the
    Receiver’s sale were set, for all practical commercial purposes, by the terms
    of the Appointment Order made earlier on June 19, 2020.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appointment Order was made when the Property
    was in an unfinished state and a significant expenditure of funds would be
    required to complete the renovations. The Appointment Order authorized the Receiver
    to take possession of the Property and market it for sale. It did not authorize
    the Receiver to complete the renovations the Pizales had started to make.
    Indeed, para. 19 of the Appointment Order limited the Receiver’s authority to
    borrow from Hillmount to $150,000, an amount that would not come close to
    completing the needed renovations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appointment Order had the effect of
    authorizing a process to market the Property on an “as is” basis or, as put by
    the Receiver in one of its factums, the Appointment Order “contemplated a
    liquidation process, not a renovation process.” That order, not the Approval
    Order, put in jeopardy any difference in value between the sale of the Property
    on an “as complete” and “as is” basis. Accordingly, the Approval Order did not
    result in any loss beyond that already worked by the Appointment Order’s
    authorization of the Receiver to market the Property on an “as is” basis. Put
    another way, the Pizales’ appeal of the Approval Order seeks to unwind the
    economic effect of the Appointment Order, which the Pizales did not appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Pizales advance a supplementary argument,
    contending that even on an “as is” sale basis the Approval Order resulted in a
    loss to them because the price fetched by the Receiver was less than one of
    their “as is” appraisals. They argue that the Chambers Judge exacerbated the Motion
    Judge’s error in finding that none of the Pizales’ appraisals considered the
    Property on an “as is” basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I am not persuaded by this submission. After the
    Receiver had entered into the Sale Agreement and moved for approval, the
    Pizales filed two appraisals of the Property:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>a December 30, 2020 appraisal by Heather Markoff, which valued the
    Property on an “as complete” basis at $6.9 million. The report recorded the
    land value “as if vacant” at $5 million and estimated the Property’s “as is”
    market value at $5.955 million, although the author stated that she was unable
    to locate current sales activity in a partially complete state of construction
    at time of sale; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>a January 4, 2021 Colliers appraisal, which estimated the “as
    complete” value of the Property at $6.075 million.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Pizales also had obtained a June 2020
    appraisal from TM Appraisers Inc., which opined that the fair market value of
    the Property on an “as if complete” basis was $7.5 million. It listed the land
    value “as if vacant” at $5 million “by extraction” and contained an “As Is”
    Addendum that estimated the “as is” value at $6.525 million. According to the
    Receiver, this appraisal was before Koehnen J. in redacted form but not
    produced in response to the Sale Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the Motion Judge referred in her
    reasons to the December 2020 and January 2021 appraisals, she did not make
    express reference to the “as is” value found in the December 2020 appraisal. I
    do not view her failure to do so as amounting to an error that somehow brings
    the “as is” value of the Property into question. As the Motion Judge noted in
    her reasons: the Receiver listed the Property at $4.8 million, a price higher
    than the appraisals it had received; 23 showings elicited no offers; the
    Receiver lowered the listing price, which resulted in its receipt and
    negotiation of a number of offers but no deal; and, finally the Receiver
    accepted the early November 2020 offer from the Purchasers, which was higher
    than its two appraisals and any other offer received. Against those efforts by
    the Receiver, and the absence of any alternative transaction presented by the
    Pizales or their creditors, the fact that the Purchaser’s offer was lower than
    the “as is” appraisals received by the Pizales spoke loudly to the reality of
    the existing market for the partially completed Property: <em>Pricewaterhousecoopers
    Inc. v. 1905393 Alberta Ltd</em>, 2019 ABCA 433, 98 Alta. L.R. (6th) 1, at
    para. 15. In those circumstances, it is no surprise that the Motion Judge did
    not treat the “as is” estimate as a relevant indicator of market conditions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the
    Chambers Judge erred in concluding that the Approval Order did not result in a
    loss greater than $10,000 and, as a result, the Pizales’ appeal did not fall within <em>BIA</em> s. 193(c).</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The “spent” receivership argument </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although that is sufficient to dispose of the
    Pizales’ panel review motion, I wish briefly to address the Pizales’ submission
    that when Hillmount assigned its first mortgage to Elle, it was “made whole”.
    They argue that with the original applicant creditor no longer part of the
    receivership and the remaining mortgagees opposed to the sale, the receivership
    was “spent,” with the result that there was no need for the Property’s sale.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Motion Judge’s reasons provide a complete
    answer to that submission. The Motion Judge spent considerable time in her
    reasons considering and weighing the interests of the various parties: at
    paras. 18-26. She wrote that:</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The mortgagees and Pizales did not put on the table any alternative
    transaction or bring a motion to discharge the Receiver.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the last point, in its December 1, 2020
    Acknowledgement in favour of the Receiver and Hillmount, Elle specifically
    acknowledged that it understood “(i) the Receivership is not at an end by
    virtue of the undersigned accepting the Assignment; and (ii) until terminated
    by Court order, the Receivership remains in full force and effect.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In light of those circumstances, the Motion Judge’s
    conclusion that, having weighed the interests of all parties there was no basis
    to allow their objections to prevent the Receiver from concluding the
    agreement, was a reasonable one.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>VII.    THIRD ISSUE: DID THE CHAMBERS JUDGE ERR IN FAILING TO GRANT
    LEAVE TO APPEAL PURSUANT TO <em>BIA</em> s. 193(e)?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In seeking to set aside the Chambers Judge’s
    refusal to grant leave to appeal the Approval Order pursuant to <em>BIA</em> s.
    193(e), the Pizales largely repeat the arguments they make in respect of s. 193(c).
    I have already dealt with those arguments. I would only add that the Chambers
    Judge, applying the well-known test for granting leave to appeal set out in <em>Business

    bankruptcy/insolvency matters beyond the parties, did not raise a serious issue
    for appeal, and would hinder the receivership and risk losing the sale to the
    Purchasers. Those conclusions were reasonable ones, anchored as they were in
    the record. I see no basis to interfere with the Chambers Judge’s refusal to
    grant the Pizales leave to appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>VIII.   FOURTH ISSUE: THE ADMINISTRATION
    ORDER</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Administration Order approved the Receiver’s
    activities described in its Second Report and First Supplement to the Second
    Report and increased the Receiver’s borrowing authority from $150,000 to
    $250,000. Before the Motion Judge, the Pizales did not oppose the issuance of
    the Administration Order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Pizales sought to appeal, or seek leave to
    appeal, the Administration Order. Before the Chambers Judge they made two
    arguments: (i) the Administration Order is inextricably linked to the issues
    regarding the Approval Order, so that if they had a right to appeal the
    Approval Order or were granted leave to do so, they were entitled to appeal the
    Administration Order; and (ii) the Administration Order creates a “loss” as it
    authorizes the Receiver to borrow a further $100,000.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In its Second Report dated December 4, 2020, the
    Receiver stated that any additional amounts borrowed would be applied to the
    Receiver’s existing fees and any future fees or expenses leading up to the
    closing of the sale. Accordingly, the purpose of the further borrowing approved
    by the Administration Order is to enable the Receiver to complete its efforts
    to sell the Property on an “as is” basis. The increased borrowing power is
    ancillary to the exercise of the Receiver’s powers under the Appointment Order
    and does not result in any further jeopardy of value than that worked by the
    Appointment Order. Accordingly, for purposes of the s. 193(c) analysis, the
    operative effect of the Administration Order is, as the Pizales describe,
    inextricably linked with the effect of the Approval Order, which the Chambers
    Judge correctly found did not fall within s. 193(c).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Chambers Judge dismissed the Pizales’ motion
