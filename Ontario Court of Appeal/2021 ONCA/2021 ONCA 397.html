  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction on a charge of second
    degree murder on April 8, 2014, after a trial by a jury presided over by
    Justice Robert B. Reid of the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two-year-old Marissa, the appellants daughter, was repeatedly assaulted
    over many days, and perhaps weeks, by Rainbow Hill, the appellants girlfriend.
    Eventually, Rainbow killed Marissa. She subsequently pled guilty to second
    degree murder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although there was no evidence the appellant physically assaulted
    Marissa, she was charged with second degree murder. The Crown alleged the
    appellant caused Marissas death by failing in her duty as a parent to protect Marissa
    from the physical abuse repeatedly perpetrated against her by Rainbow. The
    Crown alleged the appellant did so with the state of mind required for murder
    under s. 229(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury convicted. The trial judge imposed a sentence of life
    imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 15 years. The appellant appeals
    conviction only.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After hearing oral argument, the court dismissed the appeal with reasons
    to follow. These are the reasons.</p>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Crowns Closing
    Argument</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant submitted, that because of the evidence heard
    by the jury, there was a real risk the jury could allow their empathy for the very
    young victim, and their disgust with the conduct of the appellant and Rainbow,
    to  overwhelm their obligation to objectively and rationally assess the evidence
    in accordance with the legal principles provided by the trial judge. Counsel contends
    some of the arguments made by the Crown and the language used by the Crown in
    his closing jury address substantially increased the risk of a verdict based on
    an emotional response to the evidence. Counsel argues that the Crowns closing
    address resulted in an unfair trial and a miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the defence sought to depict the appellant as a person of
    limited intelligence who was manipulated, victimized and abused by Rainbow. In
    his closing address, Crown counsel made a vigorous and repeated attack on the
    viability of that defence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the main, Crown counsels submissions remained within the boundaries
    of proper advocacy. For example, the Crowns argument that the evidence showed
    the appellant to be a cunning and streetwise liar was in direct response to the
    portrayal of the appellant presented by the defence. The Crowns
    characterization found support in the evidence. Whether the Crowns argument
    would ultimately carry the day, was for the jury to decide.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel did use strong language at times in his closing argument. In
    many circumstances, that language accurately reflected the state of the evidence.
    Some of Crown counsels comments, however, were arguably overly dramatic, and
    potentially inflammatory. The Crown also misstated the evidence of one witness,
    although the evidence was far from central to the case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that any shortcomings in Crown counsels closing did
    not put the fairness of this trial at risk. There was no objection to Crown
    counsels closing and no request that the trial judge address in his
    instructions to the jury any of the remarks made by Crown counsel. </p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Instruction on
    the <em>Mens Rea</em> Required for Murder</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown relied on s. 229(a)(ii). The <em>mens rea</em> of murder under that
    section has three components:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant must have intended to cause bodily harm to Marissa;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant must have known the bodily harm was likely to cause
    Marissas death; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant must have been reckless as to whether death ensued.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant argues that Crown counsel wrongly described the <em>mens rea</em> component of s. 229(a)(ii) in his closing argument, and that the trial judges
    instructions did not adequately correct the misapprehension created by Crown
    counsels closing. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his closing argument, Crown counsel referred to the necessary intent required
    under s. 229(a)(ii) as recklessness. He then went on to argue that the
    appellant had the necessary intent for several reasons. Counsel submitted, the
    appellant knew Rainbow presented a clear and present danger to Marissa. Crown
    counsel further argued that the appellant was present virtually every time
    Rainbow assaulted Marissa. Next, the Crown contended the appellant made no
    attempt to intervene or protect Marissa in the face of those repeated beatings.
    Finally, the Crown submitted the appellants conduct showed she knew Rainbow
    would kill Marissa. All of the Crowns submissions were grounded in the
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsels reference to the necessary intent as recklessness was, as a matter
    law, incorrect. Crown counsel was not, however, purporting to instruct the jury
    on the law. He made it clear to the jury they would take their legal
    instructions from the trial judge. Crown counsel was making submissions as to the
    factual findings, which he urged the jury to make to justify a finding the
    appellant had the necessary <em>mens rea</em> for murder. Considered in that
    context, Crown counsels submissions were neither inappropriate nor misleading.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    trial judge referred to the <em>mens rea</em> requirement in s. 229(a)(ii)
    several times in the course of his instructions. In his first reference, the
    trial judge wrongly told the jury that the requirement the appellant know the
    bodily harm was likely to cause death and the requirement of recklessness as to
    whether death ensued were alternative requirements. Both are required to
    establish the required <em>mens rea</em> under s. 229(a)(ii).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The trial judge, however, correctly outlined the <em>mens
    rea</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> required in several subsequent
    passages in his instructions to the jury. The first correct reference to the
    required </span></em><em>mens rea</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> appears
    in the sentence immediately following the sentence containing the error. The
    trial judge correctly put the </span></em><em>mens rea</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> requirement to the jury three times in the page and
    one-half of transcript following his initial misstatement of the </span></em><em>mens
    rea</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>In addition to the repeated correct oral instructions, the
    jury had the trial judges instructions in writing. The required <em>mens rea</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> was accurately set out in those instructions.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There

    any event, the recklessness component of s. 229(a)(ii) was essentially
    surplusage on the facts of this case. If the jury was satisfied the appellant
    intended to cause Marissa bodily harm by failing to protect her from the
    repeated serious assaults inflicted by Rainbow, and if the jury was satisfied
    the appellant knew those assaults were likely to cause Marissas death and did
    not intervene, as she was obligated to do, the jury would inevitably have found
    the appellant to have been reckless as to whether Marissa died as a result of
    the assaults.</p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Trial Judges
    Review of the Evidence Relating to the Appellants <em>Mens Rea</em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    judges are required to relate the relevant evidence to the issues raised in the
    case. Counsel for the appellant submits the trial judge was obligated to refer
    to certain text messages when outlining the evidence relevant to the <em>mens
    rea</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> issue. Those text messages passed </span></em>between
    the appellant and Rainbow in the few days immediately preceding Marissas death. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    content of the text messages cut both ways. Parts were potentially inculpatory
    and parts were potentially exculpatory. While the trial judge did not refer to
    the specific passages put forward on appeal, he did refer to the text messages
    in a more general way in his instructions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    judges are not obligated to refer to all of the evidence that may have
    relevance to an issue at trial. Certainly, the trial judge could have referred
    to the passages from the text messages relied on by the appellant. He probably
    would have done so, had he been asked to do so at trial. His failure to do so does
    not constitute reversible error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>In holding that the failure to refer to the text messages
    did not constitute reversible error, we place significance on the position of the
    defence at trial. Counsel fully and forcefully argued the case for the
    appellant at trial. There is no suggestion the appellant was not properly
    represented. Trial counsel did not ask the trial judge to specifically refer to
    the parts of the text messages which are now put forward as crucial to an
    understanding of the appellants position with respect to <em>mens rea</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>When considering what
    evidence should be related to the various issues, trial judges are entitled to look
    to counsel for assistance in identifying the parts of the evidence which
    counsel regard as crucial to a proper understanding of their position on any
    issue. If, as the appellant now contends, one piece of evidence is crucial to
    an understanding of the defence case, one would expect trial counsel to say so.
    Trial counsel does not appear to have viewed the passages from the text
    messages as nearly as significant as does appellate counsel. We cannot say he
    was wrong in that assessment.</span></em></p>

style='font-style:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The trial judge adequately

  <h3>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Instruction on
    the After-the-Fact Conduct</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury that the appellants conduct after Marissas
    death could constitute circumstantial evidence of the appellants guilt. He
    identified three parts of the evidence as potentially after-the-fact conduct:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellants participation in the attempts to prevent the
    first responders from seeing Marissa when they attended at the apartment in
    response to the 9-1-1 call;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellants participation in the burying and then re-burying
    of her daughter; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellants attempts to keep Marissas death secret.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury, at some length, on the proper approach to be
    taken to evidence of after-the-fact conduct. He stressed, that while an
    inference of guilt could be drawn, the jury must be careful to consider all other
    possible inferences first. He further instructed the jury that even if the
    appellant was motivated by feelings of guilt, those feelings could be
    attributable to something other than the offence with which she is now
    charged.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of his instruction on the requisite <em>mens rea</em>, the trial
    judge instructed the jury that the evidence which he had earlier outlined as
    after-the-fact conduct was relevant to the issue of intent. The trial judge did
    not go into any more detail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge vetted his jury instructions with counsel before giving the jury
    those instructions. Counsel were content with the after-the-fact instruction.
    On appeal, counsel argues the trial judge was required to go into considerably
    more detail with the jury as to the possible uses and the prohibited uses of
    that evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was not prejudiced by the manner in which the trial judge approached
    the after-the-fact conduct evidence. That evidence, particularly as it related
    to the appellants involvement in the burial and re-burial of her daughter, was
    potentially powerful evidence of the appellants <em>mens rea</em>. A more
    detailed instruction as to how the jury might use that evidence to infer the
    requisite <em>mens rea</em> could only have hurt the defence position. That no
    doubt explains why the defence was satisfied with the proposed instructions and
    did not request any further instruction on the use of the evidence the trial
    judge had identified as evidence of after-the-fact conduct. The instructions
    were adequate and did not prejudice the appellant.</p>
