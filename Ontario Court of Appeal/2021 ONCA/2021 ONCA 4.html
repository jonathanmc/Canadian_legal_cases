    possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 5(2) of
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA>, </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>S.C. 1996, c. 19<i> </i>(“</span><em><span

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During the execution of a search warrant, the
    police found a kilogram of cocaine in the appellant’s basement. At trial, the
    appellant did not dispute that he possessed cocaine for the purpose of
    trafficking. The case turned on an application to exclude evidence obtained
    during the search on the basis that police breached his rights under ss. 8, 9,
    and 10 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Canadian Charter of Rights and
    Freedoms</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge dismissed the application. She
    found that: (1) the manner in which the police executed the search warrant did
    not violate the appellant’s s. 8 rights; (2) the officers’ decision to handcuff
    the appellant did not violate his s. 9 rights; and (3) the police did not
    violate the appellant’s right to counsel under s. 10(b), in any of the various
    ways that were alleged. Had she found any </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> infringements, the trial judge would not have excluded any of the
    evidence under s. 24(2). The appellant appeals the trial judge’s ruling. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would uphold the trial judge’s ruling under
    ss. 8 and 9 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. However, I respectfully disagree with two of her conclusions regarding
    s. 10(b). The police violated their duty to hold off by attempting to elicit
    evidence from the appellant before he could retain counsel. Moreover, the failure
    of the police to facilitate contact with the appellant’s counsel of choice, as
    one of the officers said he would do, combined with the three-hour delay in
    putting the appellant in touch with duty counsel, violated his s. 10(b) rights.
    Notwithstanding these infringements, I would not exclude any evidence
    discovered during the search under s. 24(2) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>application
    was based on the evidence called at the preliminary inquiry. The </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>voir dire</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span
lang=EN-CA>proceeded without any <i>viva voce </i>evidence. As discussed below,
    this resulted in certain gaps in the record, especially in relation to one of the
    s. 10(b) issues.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on confidential sources, the police
    believed the appellant was selling oxycodone from his home in New Tecumseth,
    Ontario. On May 3, 2017, the police obtained a tele-warrant to search his home.
    At 1:43 p.m., without first knocking, nine Ontario Provincial Police (“OPP”)
    officers, at least one (and probably others) with his gun drawn, forcibly
    entered the appellant’s home. In one way or another, nine officers were
    involved in breaching the door and searching the house.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Immediately upon entering the house, some of the
    officers went upstairs. The appellant and his wife were in the master bedroom.
    The police handcuffed the appellant but did not handcuff his wife; they ordered
    him to kneel on the floor and permitted her to sit on the bed. Two officers,
    P.C. Black and P.C. Hamilton, remained in the bedroom with them while other
    officers “cleared” (<i>i.e.</i>, performed a safety check) the house, which
    took roughly seven minutes. At that point, another officer, D.C. Wray, came
    into the bedroom and advised the appellant of his right to counsel. The
    appellant said that he wished to speak to a lawyer. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Officers transported the appellant and his wife to
    the police station separately. The appellant’s wife spoke to duty counsel
    promptly, at about 3:00 p.m. The appellant did not speak to a lawyer until 5:15
    p.m.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During the search of the house, the police found
    a large quantity of oxycodone pills, one kilogram of cocaine, drug
    paraphernalia, and $3,695 in Canadian currency. Following the dismissal of his </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> application, the trial judge
    found the appellant guilty based on an Agreed Statement of Facts, which
    included his admission to possessing one kilogram of cocaine for the purpose of
    trafficking.</span></p>

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></h2>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant does not challenge the validity of
    the search warrant; instead, he submits that the manner in which the police
    carried out the search infringed his s. 8 </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> rights: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Collins</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278. The appellant argues that “in
    employing a forced entry, the police used more force than was reasonably
    necessary and acted in accordance with a blanket policy not to knock and
    announce when executing drug warrants.” I would reject this submission. The
    police were justified in forcibly entering the house to prevent the destruction
    of evidence, and for safety reasons.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Evidentiary Background</span></h2>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Numerous officers testified about the search
    warrant and its execution. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>D.C. Hargreaves swore the Information to Obtain
    the warrant. He was aware that the appellant lived in the house with his wife
    and two young children. In his testimony, D.C. Hargreaves confirmed that the
    appellant had no criminal record. He did not know of any firearms in the house.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>D.C. Hargreaves testified that it was always
    part of their plan to use a battering ram to break down the appellant’s door
    because drugs can easily be flushed down the toilet. This applied to most
    drugs, except perhaps marijuana. About 90% of the drug warrants D.C. Hargreaves
    had executed involved forced entries. However, he disagreed with the suggestion
    that the OPP had a blanket policy of effecting forced entries whenever they executed
    search warrants for drugs. Rather, practical concerns about the destruction of
    evidence guided his approach. For example, he said: “If we were knocking on
    drug trafficking doors, I’m going to suggest that we would never seize
    cocaine.”</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sgt. Buligan was the lead officer in the
    execution of the warrant. He was assisted by nine officers. On the day in
    question, he was short-staffed. Because some of his officers had not received
    training on executing search warrants, he enlisted the assistance of seven officers
    from the OPP’s Emergency Response Team (“ERT”). </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sgt. Buligan testified that, based on their
    investigation, they were concerned about the loss of evidence. That is why they
    forcibly entered the appellant’s house. He disagreed that he had a blanket
    policy of using a forced entry in searches involving any drug; he too pointed
    to marijuana as an exception. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sgt. Buligan explained that other factors are at
    play, including the quantity of drugs, as well as the size and layout of the
    location to be searched. Sgt. Buligan had executed searches in residences with similar
    layouts as the appellant’s two-story house.  He observed: “I’m aware that there
    are two washrooms, upstairs and downstairs, so…these types of houses are the
    types of houses where I’ve had drugs flushed down the toilet when executing
    warrants.” </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was confusion in the evidence about whether
    the front door of the appellant’s house was locked when the police arrived to
    execute the warrant. Sgt. Buligan testified that it is preferable to simply open
    an unlocked door because forced entries are not always successful. He thought
    that the ERT officer with the battering ram, P.C. Sharp, would have checked to
    see if the door was locked. This is what is “normally done”. Sgt. Buligan did
    not check the door himself; he testified that he was at the rear of the line of
    officers waiting to enter the house. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In contrast, P.C. Sharp believed that Sgt.
    Buligan checked the door and indicated that it was locked. He said: “I don’t
    have an immediate recollection in mind, but there’s no way I would have
    breached the door without him notifying me to breach the door.” P.C. Sharp further
    testified that “there’s no hard and fast rule [on] how we do a warrant entry”. As
    I return to below, he was unaware of the knock and announce rule: see </span><em><span

    judge relied upon the officers’ evidence that drugs in pill form can be easily
    flushed down the toilet, especially in a two-story house where there are
    readily accessible washrooms on both floors. Citing James A. Fontana and David

    2097, at para. 31.  At para. 40 of her reasons, the trial judge also accepted
    Sgt. Buligan’s evidence that he “had no idea where Mr. Pileggi might be in the

lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would adopt the trial judge’s analysis on this
    point. The police had reasonable grounds to conclude that an unannounced and
    forced entry was required to prevent the destruction of evidence. Given the
    size and layout of the house, as well as the nature of the drugs in question, there
    was a real likelihood that the appellant would be able to destroy the evidence
    quickly and with ease. </span></p>

    judge accepted the evidence of P.C. Sharp and P.C. Black about how weapons are
    often present at places where they execute search warrants. As P.C. Sharp
    testified, while there may be no information indicating that weapons may be
    located in the place to be searched, it does not necessarily mean that weapons will
    not be there. The trial judge concluded that safety concerns also justified a departure

lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the trial judge that safety
    concerns also justified the officers’ forced entry. As noted above, P.C. Black
    testified that in his experience, when executing drug warrants, weapons are
    often discovered in residences. Although there was no information available to
    the officers suggesting that there were firearms located at the appellant’s
    residence, the allegations involved serious drug charges. The all too typical
    toxic combination of drugs and guns is well known to the police and the courts: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Wong</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2012 ONCA

    entitled to some degree to rely upon their collective experience when
    approaching situations that may endanger their lives. As Cromwell J. held at
    para. 20 of </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Cornell</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>:
    “[s]ection 8 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span

    rejected the submission that, instead of making an independent assessment of
    the circumstances they faced, the police simply acted in accordance with a
    blanket policy to conduct forced entries when executing search warrants for
    drugs. The appellant submits that she was wrong to do so. I see no basis upon
    which to upset this factual finding. The trial judge’s conclusion was supported
    by the uncontradicted evidence of three police officers. </span></p>

    noted above, these concerns were pronounced because of contextual
    considerations: the nature of the drugs (oxycodone pills that could be flushed)

    Black ordered the appellant to kneel on the floor. He complied and said: “Don’t

    Hamilton, handcuffed the appellant to the rear. P.C. Black advised him that he

    from this passage. She submits that this aspect of the trial judge’s reasons is
    wrong in law – the execution of a search warrant does not automatically entitle
    the police to handcuff those located in the place to be searched. I agree. However,
    I cannot agree with the further submission that it was unreasonable to handcuff
    the appellant in his home and in the police car. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fundamental problem with this argument is
    that there is no evidence that bears directly on this point. There was evidence,
    discussed above, about the safety issues that informed the method of entry into
    the home, which bore on the trial judge’s s. 8 analysis. Similarly, the issue
    arose in the evidence dealing with the delay in informing the appellant of his
    rights under s. 10(b). In that context, P.C. Black said that it was not safe to
    do so until the home had been cleared. In contrast, the officers did not field
    questions about the necessity of handcuffs at the house, nor during the
    appellant’s transport to the station. Indeed, P.C. Hamilton – the officer who
    initially handcuffed the appellant – did not even testify.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Considering this issue in the broader context, I
    cannot find fault with the trial judge’s conclusion that there was no
    infringement of s. 9 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. All of the evidence points to the unknown variables the police
    face when they enter a home to execute a search warrant, particularly as it
    relates to the presence of others in the place to be searched (an aspect of
    P.C. Black’s testimony that I return to below). In this case, the evidence
    supports the conclusion that the situation was not safe, or completely under
    control, until the house was cleared. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police were also justified in using
    handcuffs once they cleared the house. I disagree with the appellant’s
    submission that his compliance to that point required the removal of the
    handcuffs. There was no guarantee that he would continue to cooperate with the
    police.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that, because the police
    did not conduct a pat-down search on him before handcuffing him, they did not
    reasonably believe that he posed any safety concerns. I do not find this
    argument persuasive. Whether or not the appellant should have been subjected to
    a frisk search at that point was not addressed with P.C. Black nor P.C.
    Hamilton. In any event, had the police conducted a pat-down search and found
    nothing, this would not necessarily have precluded them from lawfully placing
    the appellant in handcuffs. As it turned out, the pre-transport search of the
    appellant revealed a bottle of oxycodone in his front pocket.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is important to note that the police did not
    handcuff the appellant solely for the purpose of facilitating the safe
    execution of the search warrant; he had also been placed under arrest for a
    serious criminal offence. As Binnie J. accepted in </span><i><span lang=EN-CA>R.
    v. Asante-Mensah</span></i><span lang=EN-CA>, 2003 SCC 38, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 3,
    at para. 33, an arrest is a “continuing act” that involves taking the person
    into custody and “by action or words restraining him from moving anywhere
    beyond the arrester’s control”, which continues until a detainee is either
    released or remanded into custody (adopting the definition in </span><i><span
lang=EN-CA>Holgate-Mohammed v. Duke</span></i><span lang=EN-CA>, [1984] A.C.
    437 (H.L.), at p. 441). This factor contributed to the reasonableness of the
    decision to handcuff the appellant, both at his home and during transport.
    During that time, the appellant was an arrestee and the police were entitled to
    restrain him from moving anywhere beyond their control, both for his own safety
    and the safety of the officers.</span></p>

    the police conduct is evident in the decision to allow his wife to sit on the
    bed, without handcuffs. In my view, it suggests the opposite. The police chose
    to handcuff the person at the centre of their investigation. That was the
    appellant; not his wife. Again, the lack of evidence on this point undermines
    the appellant’s contention.</span></p>

    submits that Sgt. Buligan infringed s. 10(b) by questioning the appellant

    arrest for possession of oxycodone for the purpose of trafficking. In
    cross-examination, P.C. Black insisted that it was not safe to advise the

    conclusion on this issue. It is true that the appellant made a spontaneous
    statement, one that was indirectly incriminating. The statement revealed
    knowledge of illegal items in his home, if not control over those items. Since the
    appellant had just been told that he was under arrest for possession of
    oxycodone for the purpose of trafficking, one could infer that he was referring
    to drugs.</span></p>

    Suffice it to say, Sgt. Buligan entered dangerous territory in doing so. The
    law does not require the police to explain the contents of a warrant to
    occupants when a search warrant is executed. Rather, the police must have the
    warrant with them “where it is feasible to do so, and … produce it when
    requested to do so”: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, s. 29(1). See also </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Cornell</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at paras. 38-43. However, by asking the appellant if he would like
    to tell police where anything was, Sgt. Buligan was seeking incriminating evidence.
    At the time, he did not even know whether the appellant had been advised of his
    right to counsel. He should have asked the officer who accompanied the
    appellant downstairs. This situation called for caution, not hubris.</span></p>

    the officer attempted to elicit incriminating information in the first place. In
    other words, it was the purpose of his question, and not the response, that
    violated the duty to hold off. The fact that the question did not yield any

    where anything was. The genesis of the second infringement – the denial of counsel
    of choice and the delay in the implementational component – began just minutes

    in which the police intentionally delayed the appellant’s access to counsel for
    six hours, based on a police protocol to suspend the right to counsel while
    search warrants are executed. The systemic and institutional nature of the
    police conduct made the breach in that case more serious. As noted above, the
    breach here was far more situation-specific. A perfect storm brewed between
    D.C. Wray’s failure to convey his undertaking to the transporting officer, and
    the delay that was arguably more properly attributed to the unavailability of
    duty counsel.</span></p>

    ONCA 860.<i> </i>In <em><span lang=EN-CA>Noel</span></em><i>, </i>the delay
    occurred because no one took charge of arranging a call to counsel when the
    appellant arrived at the police station. The appellant promptly requested
    access to counsel, but was then placed in a cell and left there. The first
    confirmed attempt to call counsel on the appellant’s behalf occurred three
    hours later, and it was never confirmed that the appellant actually succeeded
    in speaking to counsel. The court found the breach to be serious, noting at
    para. 32: “From the beginning, the police appear to have had a somewhat
    cavalier attitude about a fundamental, important, and long-settled&nbsp;<em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><i>&nbsp;</i>right to consult counsel without
    delay.” Due to the seriousness of the breach and the effect it would have had on
    the long-term interests of the administration of justice, this court excluded
    the evidence under s. 24(2). </p>

    with the appellant’s father, P.C. Jacome diligently attempted to enlist the
    assistance of duty counsel. Her efforts began with the arrival of the appellant
    and his wife at the station. As the situation developed, she tried to keep the
    appellant up to date. At some point, an attempt was made to contact private
    counsel, but that lawyer was not available. As soon as D.C. Wray arrived at the
    station and realized the problem, he rectified it immediately. All the while,
    no one attempted to elicit information from the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span

lang=EN-CA>This case shares greater similarities with </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hobeika</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, in which this court held that
    a five-hour delay between the arrest of the accused and his access to counsel,
    which was left completely unexplained by the police, was a serious breach. In
    that case, the seriousness of the breach was outweighed by the other </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Grant</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> factors. This court upheld the
    trial judge’s decision not to exclude the evidence. The breaches in this case
    were less serious because of the efforts of P.C. Jacome (as noted in the above
    paragraph) and the shorter period of delay (three hours as opposed to five
    hours). </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span

lang=EN-CA>In summary, the evidence demonstrates that this was a fact-specific,

    in contacting duty counsel and keeping the appellant informed of the developing

lang=EN-CA>, and makes it less serious than </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hobeika</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. But despite the factors that may tend to mitigate the seriousness
    of the breach, I conclude that the breach was serious nevertheless. The collective
    negligence involved in allowing the appellant’s s. 10(b) rights to fall through
    the cracks precludes a finding of good faith: see </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R.
    v. Le</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA>, </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>2009 SCC 34,

    As noted above, at para. 107, although the appellant surpasses the “obtained in
    a manner” threshold, there was no causal connection between the discovery of
    the evidence and the breach of the appellant’s right to counsel. In appropriate
    cases, this may mitigate the infringement: see </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Rover</span></em><span

lang=EN-CA>Notwithstanding the inappropriate overture of Sgt. Buligan at the
    house, the appellant refused to cooperate. He said “no”. Once out of the house,
    no other officer attempted to elicit information from him while he waited to
    speak to a lawyer. Overall, Sgt. Buligan’s failure to hold off had a minimal
    impact on the appellant’s </span><i><span lang=EN-CA>Charter-</span></i><span

    while detained”: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Rover</span></em><i><span

    not be underestimated”: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Rover</span></em><i><span

lang=EN-CA>Here, the appellant was not left to languish alone interminably,
    unaware of what was going on. He was kept apprised of attempts to engage duty
    counsel on his behalf. A call was made to private counsel, but the record is
    unclear as to when that happened and who was involved in the attempt to reach
    the lawyer. The appellant did not testify to shine further light on this issue.
    Nonetheless, the record is sufficiently clear on two crucial points: (1) it was
    always the intention of the police to put him in touch with counsel; and (2) efforts
    to do so were conveyed to the appellant. </span></p>

    in a reasonable manner. In these circumstances, exclusion of the evidence would
    only serve to indirectly punish the offending officers, rather than aligning
    with the overall purpose of s. 24(2) – vindicating the long-term repute of the
    criminal justice system: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hobeika</span></em><span
