  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was drinking with some friends at
    a park in London, Ontario. An argument broke out among the appellant, Dakoda Martin,
    and Andre Williams. It soon turned physical. The appellant pulled out a knife.
    Mr. Martin died from a stab wound to his chest; Mr. Williams was stabbed in the
    back, but his wound was not serious. The appellant walked away from the scene
    and dropped the knife into a sewer. When he was arrested moments later, the
    appellant told the police, “They jumped me”. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the appellant testified and contended
    that he was attacked by the two victims at the same time. In order to defend
    himself, the appellant pulled out a knife. He swung the knife behind him; it
    was at this point that the victims sustained their injuries. As he was trying
    to get away, he was pursued by Mr. Williams. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in her final instructions to the jury on after-the-fact conduct, intoxication,
    and the permitted use of the “they jumped me” utterance. The appellant did not
    draw any of these shortcomings to the trial judge’s attention at the time.
    Although the trial judge’s instructions were deficient in some respects, I
    would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='text-transform:none'>FACTUAL OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> The appellant consumed alcohol, marijuana, and
    perhaps other drugs with about five other people in a London park. Dakoda
    Martin, Andre Williams, Aliesje Alvarado, and the appellant were part of this
    group. The latter three testified about the fight that resulted in the death of
    Mr. Martin and the injury to Mr. Williams. A passerby, Jonathan Jones, also
    witnessed the incident and provided very damning evidence against the
    appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s evening began after work when he
    and a co-worker shared a pitcher of beer at a local bar. Later in the night,
    the appellant met up with Mr. Williams and another man at a different bar,
    where they drank beer and tequila and consumed some cocaine. Mr. Martin and Ms.
    Alvarado eventually joined them. The group continued to drink and consume
    cocaine at the bar, then temporarily separated before reuniting at the park.
    Roughly two hours later, around 3:00 a.m., the fight broke out among the appellant
    and the victims. The witnesses all gave different versions of what happened.
    For some, their testimony at trial differed from their earlier police
    statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified that the altercation
    started over his “mickey” of whiskey. He accused Mr. Williams of stealing it
    and called him a “goof”. Mr. Williams challenged the appellant to repeat his
    comment. The appellant did so, and Mr. Martin and Mr. Williams attacked the
    appellant from behind, beating him and pummelling him with their fists. The
    appellant fell to the ground and pulled out a knife. Holding the knife in his
    right hand, with the blade facing out, he made a slashing motion behind him two
    or three times. He said his intent was to scare the two men and end the attack.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Williams testified that the altercation
    started over the appellant’s conduct toward Ms. Alvarado. The appellant had
    been flirting with Ms. Alvarado, and she asked Mr. Williams to tell the
    appellant to leave her alone. When Mr. Williams and Mr. Martin told the
    appellant to stop bothering Ms. Alvarado, the appellant became angry. The three
    men stood up, the appellant and Mr. Martin began to tussle, and Mr. Martin fell
    to the ground as if he had been knocked out. Mr. Williams pushed the appellant
    off Mr. Martin and tried to punch the appellant, but he slipped before he
    could. He thought the appellant punched him in the back, and only realized
    later that he had been stabbed. Contrary to his trial testimony, in his police
    statement, Mr. Williams said the altercation started over the appellant making
    a rude comment. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Alvarado testified that she walked away from
    the group after telling Mr. Williams that the appellant was bothering her. A
    few minutes later, she saw the appellant and Mr. Martin fighting. She was
    unsure who threw the first punch, but she saw Mr. Martin fall to the ground. He
    was bleeding. When she went to him, she saw he had a wound in his chest. Ms.
    Alvarado’s testimony that the appellant was only fighting Mr. Martin was
    inconsistent with her police statement, where she said the appellant was “a
    single person trying to fight two men”, i.e., Mr. Martin and Mr. Williams.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Jones had just finished his shift as a
    bouncer at a nearby bar and was on his way to his girlfriend’s place. He had
    not consumed any alcohol or drugs. Mr. Jones testified that, as he was walking
    past the park, he heard a commotion and yelling. He could see a larger man in a
    yellow shirt (the appellant) yelling at a woman, a smaller Caucasian man (Mr.
    Martin), and a smaller Black man (Mr. Williams). The appellant was swinging at
    the victims in a haymaker motion. Mr. Jones’ view was obstructed for a few
    seconds as he passed some bushes, but when the group came back into view, Mr.
    Martin was lying on his back, with the appellant on top of him, making punching
    or stabbing motions toward Mr. Martin’s chest. Mr. Williams was moving away
    from the appellant. Mr. Jones did not see Mr. Williams fighting the appellant. Mr.
    Jones called 911 and the police arrived almost immediately. In his police statement,
    Mr. Jones did not tell the police that he saw the appellant making a punching
    or stabbing motion at Mr. Martin. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the end of the fight, the appellant walked
    away, toward the street. He testified he knew Mr. Martin had been hurt when he
    saw him fall to the ground. When he arrived at the street, he dropped his knife
    through the sewer grate. He continued walking and called his wife to tell her
    he had been jumped, the police were on their way, and he would likely be
    arrested. When the police arrived, he yelled, “They jumped me.” He complied
    with the officers’ orders, and they arrested him. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Martin suffered three wounds: an incised
    stab wound to his right thigh; a perforating stab wound to his right upper arm;
    and a downward-directed, plunging stab wound to his right upper chest, just
    below the clavicle. The chest wound was fatal. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Williams suffered a superficial stab wound
    to his lower left back. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s only injuries were a swollen lip

  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in her instructions on the use the jury could make of the after-the-fact
    conduct in this case, being the evidence that the appellant walked away from
    the fray and then dropped the knife into a sewer.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant focuses on the following aspects
    of this instruction:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>Evidence of what a person did after an
    offence was committed may help you decide whether it was that person who
    committed it</span></u><span lang=EN-CA>. It may help, it may not. What a
    person did after an offence was committed may indicate that he acted in a way
    which, according to human experience and logic, is consistent with the conduct
    of a person who committed the offence and inconsistent with the conduct of
    someone who did not do so. On the other hand, there may be another explanation
    for what Mr. Reddick did afterwards, something unconnected with participation
    in the offences charged.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>To decide the reason for what Mr. Reddick did
    afterwards, you will consider all of the evidence. Of particular importance is
    evidence that offers an explanation for the conduct. You must not use this
    evidence about what Mr. Reddick did afterwards in deciding or helping you to
    decide that Mr. Reddick <u>committed the offences charged</u> unless you reject
    any other or innocent explanation for it. If you do not or cannot find that Mr.
    Reddick did those things because he was conscious of having done what is
    alleged against him, you must not use this evidence in deciding or in helping
    you to decide that Mr. Reddick committed the offences charged. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On the other hand, if you find that anything
    Mr. Reddick did afterwards was because he was <u>conscious of having done what
    is alleged against him</u>, you may consider this evidence together with all of
    the other evidence in coming to your verdict. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant objects to the trial judge’s
    opening instruction that: “Evidence of what a person did after an offence was
    committed may help you decide whether it was the person who committed it”. The
    appellant submits that this instruction was irrelevant and unhelpful because
    there was no question that the appellant stabbed Mr. Martin and Mr. Williams. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I disagree. The instruction was legally correct.
    It respected the principle that the ultimate decision as to who-did-what is the
    province of the jury. Among other things, the trial judge said, “Deciding the
    facts … is your job and not mine. … Only you decide what happened in this case.”
    However, in her final instructions, when reviewing the elements of second
    degree murder in s. 229(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, on the threshold
    question of whether the appellant caused Mr. Martin’s death, the trial judge
    said, “May I suggest, ladies and gentlemen, that you will have little
    difficulty answering this question, ‘Yes’.”</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant further contends that the
    instructions were erroneous in their references to “committed the offences
    charged” and “conscious of having done what is alleged against him”, as
    underscored above. The appellant acknowledges that the after-the-fact conduct
    could be used to infer that he had not acted in self-defence. However, he
    submits that the manner in which this evidence was left with the jury permitted
    them to use it to distinguish between liability for second degree murder and
    manslaughter. He submits that the jury should have been specifically instructed
    not to use the evidence in this manner.</span></p>

    considerations at play when reviewing the adequacy of instructions on
    after-the-fact conduct, at para. 35:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Instructions necessary to prevent a jury from
    mishandling of evidence of after-the-fact conduct are case-specific. Whether a
    trial judge’s instructions were sufficient depends on the significance of the
    nature of the conduct involved; the use made of the evidence at trial; the
    instructions given about its use; and the positions of the parties about the
    adequacy of those instructions. Some background is necessary to evaluate the
    claim.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, it is especially important to
    evaluate the use to which this evidence was put at trial. The appellant’s
    actions in walking away from the scene and dropping the knife in the sewer linked
    the confrontation with the victims with his utterance that “They jumped me”.
    The trial was focused on these two endpoints in the dispute about whether the
    appellant acted in self-defence. This was the predominant, if not singular,
    issue at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the appellant was asked about walking
    away and discarding the knife both in his examination-in-chief and
    cross-examination, this evidence assumed little prominence at trial. Crown
    counsel made only a passing reference to it in his closing address to the jury;
    his submissions focused on self-defence. Defence counsel made greater use of
    this evidence – especially the fact that the appellant walked away – in </span><i><span
lang=EN-CA>support</span></i><span lang=EN-CA> of his self-defence claim. He
    said the following:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>We know Mr. Reddick availed himself of the
    easiest thing he could to stop a fight and to get away, his knife – and it
    worked. Disastrous consequences but it worked. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>After he’s no longer being set upon or
    attacked, my words, he leaves very quickly. Once he’s away, he begins walking
    until he’s arrested. You heard the testimony of the officer that he is not
    running away. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>He left quickly, by Mr. Reddick’s testimony,
    walked away very quickly, got rid of the knife, continued on and was arrested and
    said ‘I got jumped’.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The crux of the trial revolved around the
    competing accounts of Mr. Williams, Ms. Alvarado, Mr. Jones, and the appellant.
    Collectively, their evidence focused on how the fight started and who-did-what-to-whom.
    The after-the-fact conduct assumed a subordinate role at trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s potential liability for
    manslaughter was left to the jury as an included offence. However, little
    attention was given to manslaughter at trial. In their closing addresses,
    neither counsel mentioned the word “manslaughter”. The sole focus was on
    self-defence. This focus may well have been guided by the reality that the
    victim died from a “plunging” wound to his heart, making manslaughter an
    unlikely, if not implausible outcome of this trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree that the evidence of the appellant
    walking away from the scene and the disposing of the weapon used to kill the
    victim would not have assisted the jury in determining whether the appellant
    had the requisite intent for murder. As a matter of human experience and logic,
    this conduct was equally consistent with manslaughter as it was with second
    degree murder. But nobody – not the trial judge, Crown counsel, or defence counsel
    – invited the jury to draw that inference. It may have been more helpful had
    the charge to the jury foreclosed that line of reasoning. However, such an
    instruction was not requested. </span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The
    trial judge invited input from counsel on her proposed instructions to the
    jury. She previewed her draft instructions on after-the-fact conduct, to which
    the appellant stated that he had “no difficulty”. No objection was registered
    after the trial judge delivered her charge, and no explanation has been
    advanced for the failure to object. There is no assertion of ineffective
    assistance of counsel. </span></p>

    want to know what you say about that.” After further discussion, the trial
    judge followed up and asked, “But it’s not being advanced as a defence or a
    partial defence in this case”? Defence counsel answered, “No. … Well, it’s just
    a, I think it’s a factor in the overall picture”, and, “I don’t … know how
    deeply Your Honour ought to delve into that, quite frankly, other than the fact
    I don’t think there’d be any question in anyone’s mind that drinking and drugs
    form part of the overall scenario.” The colloquy ended with the trial judge
    saying: “I agree, I agree. I just needed to know that it’s not being advanced,

lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Crown counsel also referred to the appellant’s consumption
    of alcohol. Earlier in the trial, in cross-examination, the appellant admitted
    that he was always in control of his body and his actions, and that he acted
    voluntarily. Building on this theme, Crown counsel told the jury in his closing
    submissions that the evidence of consumption did not assist the appellant
    because he acted voluntarily that night. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her final instructions, the trial judge
    addressed the issue of intoxication on more than one occasion. She reviewed
    some of the evidence on the drug and alcohol consumption of Mr. Williams, Mr.
    Martin, Ms. Alvarado, and the appellant. The trial judge also addressed the
    issue of intoxication when explaining the fault requirements for murder in s.
    229(a) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. She instructed the jury that they could consider the words and
    conduct of the appellant before, during, and after the event to determine his
    state of mind. As she said, “They may help you decide what he meant or did not
    mean to do.” Referring to the appellant’s evidence, the trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In cross-examination he testified that he knew
    where one’s heart is located in one’s chest and he was aware that a stabbing
    wound to the chest can and is likely to cause bodily harm. He denied attacking
    Mr. Martin. <u>He said he had no mental health issues, he was “pretty
    intoxicated”, and that I think were his exact words, but in control of his body
    and movements</u>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then mentioned the evidence of
    police officers who said that the appellant had no trouble complying with their
    commands or directions that night. This was followed by the following
    instruction:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>You may conclude as a matter of common sense
    that if a sane and sober person does something that has predictable
    consequences, that person usually intends or means to cause those consequences.
    But that is simply one way for you to determine a person’s actual state of
    mind, what he actually meant to do. <u>It is a conclusion that you may only
    reach however after considering all of the evidence.</u> It is not a conclusion
    you must reach. It is for you to say whether you will reach that conclusion in
    this case. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no objection to these instructions
    other than defence counsel noting that a passage had been omitted from the
    draft instructions on the issue of the intent for murder (in para. 34, above).
    The trial judge advised the jury of the omission and then re-read the entire
    passage, with the following, previously omitted, excerpt included:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>You will want to consider Mr. Reddick’s
    evidence on this point. He said that he wanted to scare Mr. Martin and Mr.
    Williams in order to stop their attack on him.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant raises a number of complaints
    about the instructions related to intoxication. Before addressing them, I
    emphasize that the appellant did not rely upon the partial defence of
    intoxication. In support of his position that he acted in self-defence, he
    asserted that he did not intentionally stab either victim; instead, they were
    injured when the appellant waved the knife from behind, as he tried to stand
    and get away from the confrontation. In this sense, the appellant asserted that
    the injuries he caused were accidental. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in the manner in which she characterized the appellant’s lack of sobriety by tracking
    the Crown’s cross-examination of the appellant and consequently conflating the
    different levels of intoxication recognized in the jurisprudence. In </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Daley</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3
    S.C.R. 523, at paras. 41-43, the Supreme Court of Canada addressed three
    legally relevant degrees of intoxication: (a) “mild intoxication”, which is not
    recognized as “a factor or excuse in determining whether the accused possessed
    the requisite </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>mens rea</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>”;
    (b) “advanced intoxication”, which may be sufficient to raise a reasonable
    doubt about the requisite </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>mens rea</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>; and (c) “extreme intoxication”, which is akin to automatism,
    negates voluntariness, and is a complete defence to criminal responsibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant contends that, by referring to the
    appellant’s evidence about being in control of his bodily movements, the trial
    judge set the bar too high by suggesting that only extreme intoxication could
    undermine the intent for murder. She should have focused on advanced
    intoxication. In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Daley</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>,
    at para. 41, Bastarache J. said that advanced intoxication “will most often be
    the degree of intoxication the jury will grapple with in murder trials”: see
    also </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Robinson</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>,
    [1996] 1 S.C.R. 683, at para. 49.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, there was nothing improper about the
    Crown’s cross-examination on the appellant’s degree of intoxication. He was
    entitled to test the appellant’s evidence in the way that he chose. Defence
    counsel did not object. Although the appellant now attempts to link this aspect
    of the cross-examination to the intent for murder, it would appear that, in
    pursuing this line of questioning, the Crown was focused on self-defence. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, it would have been better had the trial
    judge clarified the distinction between levels of intoxication for the jury,
    but she was not asked to do so. Taking the charge as a whole, the jury was
    properly focused on the appellant’s actual state of mind at the time of the
    incident, specifically in relation to whether he formed one of the intents in
    s. 229(a) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. This was all within the context of a trial where the appellant
    made a tactical decision to rely on a single defence – self defence – and did
    not purport to rely on the partial defence of intoxication: </span><em><span

    instructions, the appellant contends that it was incomplete. The instruction is
    set out above, at para. 35. The appellant takes issue with the following
    sentence: “It is a conclusion that you may only reach however after considering
    all of the evidence”. The appellant contends that the trial should have said:
    “It is a conclusion that you may only reach, however, after considering all of
    the evidence, <u>including evidence about Mr. Reddick’s consumption of alcohol
    (and drugs)</u>”. </span></p>

    judge completed the sentence in the manner now suggested on appeal. Once again,
    she was not asked to do so. In any event, this omission does not amount to

lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is an unimportant point. Earlier in her
    instructions, the trial judge told the jury that they were the sole judges of
    the facts. Given that the utterance did not form part of an agreed statement of
    facts or a formal admission under s. 655 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal
    Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, the jury was still required to find as a
    fact that the appellant made the utterance. They undoubtedly would have.</span></p>

    judge should have instructed the jury more fully on the use to be made of the
    appellant’s utterance. I agree that the trial judge should have gone further
    and, in accordance with </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Edgar</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, instructed the jury that the utterance could not be used for the
    truth of its contents. Both parties, as well as the trial judge, seemed to
    treat the statement as being admissible for this purpose. This is most evident
    in the Crown’s closing address. But this misapprehension inured to the
    appellant’s benefit. The appellant was permitted to corroborate his testimony
    about being jumped with his own statement, made moments after the fight, and
    the statement was left to be used for the truth of its contents. This latter
    use is what the court in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Edgar</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> sought to prevent.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> The appellant further submits that the trial
    judge should have better explained how the statement related to his credibility
    as a witness and his claim of self-defence. I agree with the Crown that the
    relevance of the utterance to self-defence would have been obvious to the jury
    – it was an assertion that he was just defending himself from attack. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge should have mentioned the
    utterance in the context of the appellant’s credibility, especially since his
    sincerity was challenged by the Crown in cross-examination. However, in his
    closing address, defence counsel relied on the spontaneous utterance in urging
    the appellant’s version of events on the jury. Acting on the mistaken assumption
    that the utterance was admissible for its truth, the Crown asked the jury to
    find that it was untrue and merely a less-detailed version of his trial
    testimony. In reviewing the appellant’s testimony, the trial judge referred to
    this statement. Neither defence counsel nor the Crown objected to the trial
    judge’s instruction on this issue.</span></p>
