<p class=Onappealfrom><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the sentence imposed on
November 2, 2018 by Justice J. Wright of the Ontario Court of Justice.</span></p>

<p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>C.K. pleaded guilty to what the trial judge described as a brutal and
savage beating of a female who had come to his home to use drugs. He was
sentenced to six years to be served concurrently on convictions for assault,
assault causing bodily harm, sexual assault and unlawful confinement. He
appeals the sentence and raises two issues. </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, he submits that the trial judge miscalculated the pre-sentence
custody and consequently, he did not receive the proper credit for time served.
C.K. was in pre-sentence custody from September 12, 2016 until November 2, 2018.
We have calculated that amounts to 781 days. He was given credit for 782 days
at 1:1.5. We see no error in the calculation</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Second, C.K. submits that his sentence should be either stayed or
reduced because of the ten-month delay from conviction to sentence. He relies
on this court’s decision in <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Charley</span></em> 2019
ONCA 726 which set a presumptive ceiling of a five-month delay. We note at the
outset that <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em> post-dated the sentencing
so that the transitional exceptional circumstances set out in a typical <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Jordan </span></em>analysis would apply. Here, the guilty plea was
February 1, 2018. Following the plea, the appellant brought an application to
strike the plea. That application was dismissed on May 3, 2018. He was
sentenced on November 2, 2018. Therefore, three months of the ten-month delay
between conviction and sentence was attributable to the appellant’s application.
The remaining delay related to the fact that the appellant fired his counsel
and obtained the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gladue</span></em> Report. The total delay
in the circumstances is not unreasonable.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in'><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Leave to appeal sentence is allowed, but the sentence
appeal is dismissed. </p>
