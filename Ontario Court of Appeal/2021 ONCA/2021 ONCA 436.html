  <p><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Hoy
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for sexual assault. He also applies
    to adduce fresh evidence in relation to sentence and, based on that evidence,
    seeks leave to appeal his sentence.   </p>
  <p class=Heading>The background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial unfolded over two days. The issue at trial was whether the
    sexual activity that occurred was consensual.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant and two female friends, S. and V., were invited to the
    appellant’s apartment. There, they hung out with the appellant and two of his
    male friends. The complainant was 16 years of age; the appellant was 18 years
    of age. The complainant and her friends were offered, and took, pills which
    they believed were Xanax. The three males did not take any of the pills. After
    a while, the complainant and V. went into one of the bedrooms and laid down. At
    some point, the appellant joined them. At a certain point, V. left the room. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that after V. left the room, the appellant
    began touching her and that she felt heavy, unable to move from the drugs, and
    was in and out of consciousness. The complainant testified that the appellant
    got on top of her and tried to penetrate her. She called out for V. and told
    the appellant to stop. (V. did not testify at the trial.)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S. testified that she heard the complainant calling for V. and yelling
    “stop”, while she was in another room with one of the males. She testified that
    the complainant sounded scared. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that V. communicated to him that the complainant
    wanted to lose her virginity, that the sexual activity began before V. left the
    room, and that the sexual activity that occurred, including intercourse, was
    consensual. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few days after they had attended at the appellant’s apartment, the
    complainant and S. reported the incident to the police. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The trial judge’s reasons</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered the principles in <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em>, [1991]
    1 S.C.R. 742. She did not believe the evidence of the appellant and explained
    why. Not only did she not believe his evidence, but, she stated, when
    considered in the context of the entire evidence, it did not raise a reasonable
    doubt. Finally, she considered whether, based on the evidence that she did accept,
    the Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge noted that the reliability of the evidence was a
    significant issue that required careful consideration. The complainant and S.
    had consumed drugs before the sexual activity occurred. The trial judge listed
    several details about the incident that the complainant had difficulty
    remembering. The trial judge found that while the complainant remembered some
    parts of the incident and not others, there was no doubt in her mind about whether
    she consented. Moreover, her evidence was somewhat corroborated by S., who was
    no longer friends with the complainant and testified at trial under subpoena.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted that there were inconsistencies in the evidence of S., and
    listed some of them, but she accepted that at some point S. heard the
    complainant calling for V. and yelling “stop”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted that the complainant and S. discussed the incident before
    going to the police. However, she rejected appellant’s trial counsel’s
    suggestion that they colluded to fabricate the allegations against the
    appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the evidence that she accepted, the trial judge was satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    sentenced the appellant to a period of imprisonment of two years less a day.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The issues on appeal against conviction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant advances two arguments on his appeal against conviction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he argues that the trial judge failed to consider whether innocent collusion
    undermined the reliability of the complainant’s and S.’s testimony. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    he argues that the trial judge failed to apply the second step of <em>W.</em><em><span
lang=EN-CA>(</span></em><em>D.)</em> in a meaningful way. Instead, the
    appellant says, the trial judge impermissibly engaged in a credibility contest.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Innocent collusion </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject the appellant’s argument that this court should order a new trial
    because the trial judge failed to consider whether innocent collusion
    undermined the reliability of the complainant’s and S.’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant conflates the fact that the trial judge did not expressly address
    innocent collusion in her reasons with the issue of whether she considered the
    possibility of it in assessing the reliability of the complainant and S.’s
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Innocent
    collusion occurs when, through mere conversation, false memories are implanted
    and overwhelm independent recollection. However, courts must be wary of jumping
    to the conclusion that that a witness’s evidence is no longer independent, and
    has been tainted by innocent collusion, simply because of a conversation.
    Witnesses may know each other. It is human nature to discuss what happened
    immediately after offending behaviour takes place: Peter Sankoff, <em>The Law
    of Witnesses and Evidence in Canada</em>, loose-leaf (Toronto: Thomson Reuters,
    2019), at §7.4(c), adopted in <a name="_Hlk74121598"><em>R. v. L.(R.G.)</em></a> (2004), 185 C.C.C. (3d) 55 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 37, <em><span lang=EN-CA>per</span></em> Weiler J.A. (dissenting, but not on this point), appeal quashed, 2005 SCC 18,
    [2005] 1 S.C.R. 288. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel’s primary argument at trial was that the complainant and S.
    intentionally colluded. She adverted to the risk of innocent collusion in her
    reply submissions but had laid no foundation during the trial to this
    submission. The complainant testified that she had an independent recollection
    of events and S.’s testimony that she heard the complainant call out for V. and
    yell “stop” withstood cross-examination. Defence counsel did not cross-examine
    the complainant nor S. as to the risk that their recollection of events had
    been tainted by their discussions before going to the police.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge explicitly accepted that the complainant and S. discussed the
    incident before going to the police and rejected intentional collusion in her
    reasons.  She also specifically noted that the reliability of the evidence was
    a significant issue that required careful consideration, and she carefully
    considered the reliability of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case is different from <em>R. v. Burnie</em>, 2013 ONCA 112, 303 O.A.C. 76, <em>R.&nbsp;v.
    Burke</em>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 47, and <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. F.(J.)</span></em> (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), on which the appellant relies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    this case, <em>Burnie</em> involved similar fact evidence of two alleged
    instances of sexual assault. <em>Burnie </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>applied</span></em> <em>R. v. Handy</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, 2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2&nbsp;S.C.R.
    908</span></em>, which held that if there is an air of reality to an allegation
    of collusion, before admitting similar fact evidence, a trial judge is required
    to consider whether the Crown has proven on a balance of probabilities that the
    evidence was not tainted by collusion.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Burke</em> and <em>F.(J.)</em> did not involve similar fact evidence. But they too are
    very different from this case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Burke</em>, Sopinka J., writing for the Court, found that the convictions
    of a former Christian Brother at the Mount Cashel Orphanage for indecent
    assault were unreasonable in light of the evidence at trial. The trial judge’s
    assessment of the credibility of the two complainants, E. and C., could not “be
    supported on any reasonable view of the evidence”: at para. 7. Their evidence
    contained many inconsistencies and falsehoods, and C. had a history of chronic
    dishonesty. However, Sopinka J. wrote, the “strong possibility of collusion”
    should also have prevented the trial judge from using C.’s evidence to
    corroborate that of E.: at para. 33. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    contacted by police investigating abuse at the orphanage, C. claimed he had
    nothing to say. It was only after C. had been contacted by the lawyer who was
    pursuing a highly publicized civil action on behalf of E. against the accused
    that C. came forward with his claim. There was a risk that C.’s claims against
    the accused arose from his knowledge of the statements made by E., gleaned
    through his discussions with what became their common lawyer. Nothing in the
    trial judge’s reasons indicated that she was alive to that possibility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant does not argue that the verdict in this matter was unreasonable. Here,
    unlike in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Burke</span></em>, the trial judge explicitly
    accepted that the complainant and S. discussed the incident before going to the
    police. And, unlike in <em>Burke</em>, where C.’s position in relation to the
    alleged criminal conduct changed after discussions with E.’s lawyer, in this
    case there was no evidence that either the complainant or S. changed her
    version of events after they discussed the incident. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em><span lang=EN-CA>F.(J.)</span></em>, at the behest of someone who had a
    personal animus against the accused, the complainants, over the course of many
    conversations and meetings, discussed a karate stretch that the accused had
    performed on them. The complainants heard about sexual accusations made by
    other boys in a context in which the accused was portrayed as a “sexual pervert
    and predator”. This court concluded that there was “serious potential for
    inadvertent tainting… particularly tainting about [the complainants’]
    perception of the appellant’s intent” in performing the stretch: <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>at para. 79</span></em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case is not about the risk of a slight reinterpretation of an event, such as in <em>F.(J.).</em> In that case, the core event – the stretch – was the same
    across complainants. The potential for innocent collusion related to the
    allegations of sexual purpose, not the touching itself. Here, the appellant
    relies on the possibility of innocent collusion to say that the complainant’s
    vivid recollection of core events – being immobilized and drifting in and out
    of consciousness, being assaulted, crying out for V. and yelling “stop”
    repeatedly – were innocently  implanted  through her conversations with S.
    before going to police. It is difficult to understand how such a vivid
    recollection of core events could have been the product of innocent tainting. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    judges are presumed to know the law. As Moldaver J.A., as he then was, did in <em>R.
    v. C.(U.)</em>, 2009 ONCA 367, 248 O.A.C. 341, at para. 26, in the
    circumstances of this case, I start from the premise that, in assessing the
    reliability of the Crown’s evidence, the trial judge considered the possibility
    of innocent collusion and was satisfied that it either lacked an air of reality
    or was satisfied that the key elements of the complainant’s and S.’s evidence
    were not tainted by collusion. The appellant has presented nothing to the
    contrary. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second step of <em><span lang=EN-CA>W.(D.)</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the appellant’s argument that the trial judge failed to apply the second
    step of <em>W.(D.)</em> in a meaningful way, the appellant says the trial
    judge’s analysis of the second step of<em> W.(D.)</em> was perfunctory and she
    did not explain why the appellant’s evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt.
    In particular, he submits that she failed to consider that two pieces of
    evidence (evidence of saliva on the complainant’s underwear and the evidence
    about who was in the room) were equally or more consistent with his version of
    events, and failed to consider S.’s evidence that V. and the complainant
    engaged in sexual activity with each other on another occasion. He says the
    evidence of V. and the complainant’s prior sexual activity with each other
    makes it more likely that, on the complainant’s behalf, V. would have asked him
    to take the complainant’s virginity, as he testified was the case. Effectively,
    he submits that if the trial judge had considered all this evidence at the
    second step, she would have found that his evidence raised a reasonable doubt.
    Instead, as I have said, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    impermissibly engaged in a credibility contest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject this argument. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant asks us to parse the trial judge’s reasons. The trial judge expressly
    considered the evidence of the saliva on the complainant’s underwear and of who
    was in the room in her analysis of the third step of <em>W.(D.).</em> She
    essentially treated the saliva evidence as neutral and found that both the
    appellant and S.’s evidence as to who was in the room corroborated the
    complainant’s evidence. A trial judge need not address every piece of evidence
    in her reasons. It is not surprising that the trial judge did not advert to the
    evidence that V. and the complainant engaged in sexual activity with each other
    on a prior occasion; it is not probative of whether V. brokered a deal for the
    appellant to take the complainant’s virginity. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    judge’s careful reasons clearly demonstrate that she understood her verdict
    should not be based on a choice between the appellant’s and the complainant’s
    evidence, but on whether, based on the <span class=Underline>whole</span> of
    the evidence, she was left with a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <p class=Heading>Fresh evidence and leave to appeal against sentence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proposed fresh evidence is that the appellant suffered hardship while in
    custody, both as the result of being assaulted and COVID-19 restrictions, and
    that he has made efforts towards rehabilitation since being released on bail
    pending appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant does not argue that the trial judge erred in law or principle in
    imposing the sentence that she did, or that the sentence imposed was
    demonstrably unfit. Rather, he argues that if his appeal against conviction
    fails, this court should reduce his sentence to time served (i.e. less than
    seven months) based upon the proposed fresh evidence as to circumstances
    arising after his sentence was imposed and thereby avoid his reincarceration. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court cannot act as a <em><span lang=EN-CA>de facto</span></em> parole board.
    It will vary a sentence based on changes in circumstances relevant to sentence
    that occurred between the imposition of sentence and the hearing of the appeal
    only exceptionally: <em>R. v. Ghadban</em>, 2015 ONCA 760, 342 O.A.C. 177, at
    para. 25; <em>R. v. L.S.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2017 ONCA 685, 354 C.C.C. (3d) 71, at paras. 112, 117. The exceptional
    circumstances in <em>Ghadban</em> related to the progress that the offender had
    made while awaiting the hearing of his appeal. The appellant’s efforts toward
    rehabilitation since on bail described in the proposed fresh evidence are far
    from the “very unusual significant strides” taken by the appellant in <em>Ghadban</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 23</span></em>. Indeed, the trial judge
    had before her essentially the same qualitative information about the
    appellant’s rehabilitative prospects and efforts as contained in the proposed
    fresh evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    in this case, which involves the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen
    years, s. 718.01 of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46,</span></em> requires that the court give primary
    consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.
    Reducing the appellant’s sentence to time-served would not reflect the gravity
    of the offence. As the trial judge noted, the complainant was 16, drugged, and
    virtually helpless when the assault occurred. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the fresh evidence does not fit the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Palmer</span></em> criteria: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Palmer v. The Queen</span></em>, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
    759, at p. 775.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is eligible for parole shortly. No doubt the parole board will pay
    careful attention to positive steps taken by the appellant since he was
    sentenced and his experience in custody. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. I would
    grant leave to appeal the sentence, but I would dismiss the fresh evidence
    application and the sentence appeal.</p>
