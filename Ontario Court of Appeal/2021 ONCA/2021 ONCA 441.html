    sexual assault involving three complainants, S.J., H.J. (together referred to
    as “the first two complainants”) and J.W. (“the third complainant”). The
    appellant was convicted of sexual assault and sexual exploitation of the first two
    complainants, and sexual assault of the third complainant.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The convictions turned on the trial judge’s
    assessment of the credibility of the complainants and the appellant when viewed
    in the context of the evidence as a whole, and the Crown’s obligation to prove
    the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claims that (a) the trial judge
    offended the rule in <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, by considering
    and accepting the complainants’ evidence before considering the appellant’s
    evidence; (b) he erred in rejecting the appellant’s evidence without providing
    a considered and reasoned acceptance of the evidence; and (c) he erred in
    relying on the absence of a proven motive as the basis to accept the third complainant’s
    evidence.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge gave detailed oral reasons for

lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the outset, he explained the applicable
    standard and burden of proof, and the rule in <em>W.(D.). </em>He recognized
    that the key question is whether, on the evidence as a whole, the trier of fact
    is satisfied of the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In conducting his analysis of the evidence, the
    trial judge reviewed each complainant’s evidence as well as the evidence of the
    other crown witnesses including other family members and an employee of the
    Children’s Aid Society, the points raised by the defence, and he explained why
    he accepted each complainant’s evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before considering the appellant’s evidence, the
    trial judge cautioned himself that “the acceptance of the evidence of the complainants
    by no means ends the matter as it is essential that the evidence of [the
    appellant], as well as all the defence evidence, should be assessed in light of
    the whole of the evidence” to determine whether he was left with a reasonable
    doubt. He then reviewed the appellant’s evidence, separately laying out the
    appellant’s evidence respecting the allegations of each complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In respect of the allegations made by the first
    two complainants, the trial judge recognized that the appellant was under no
    obligation to prove anything and that “the fundamental concepts of onus of
    proof” and proof beyond a reasonable doubt must be considered. He also held
    there was no specific aspect of the appellant’s evidence that caused him to
    disbelieve the appellant. However, when he considered the appellant’s evidence
    in the context of all the evidence and contrasted it with these complainants’
    testimony, he concluded that both complainants were telling the truth and that he
    had “no reasonable doubt about the charges at all” (save for one that was
    dismissed and is not the subject of this appeal). He was therefore satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of sexually assaulting
    and sexual exploitation of the first two complainants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge accepted the evidence of the
    third complainant, rejected the appellant’s evidence, and was satisfied beyond
    a reasonable doubt that the appellant sexually assaulted her. He found the
    appellant’s evidence respecting this allegation to be “problematic”, as parts
    of his evidence were inconsistent or “contrary to common sense”. He also found
    the appellant’s reaction to the allegation troubling. In contrast, he found the
    complainant’s actions in the face of the alleged assaults to be logical, and held
    that it would have made no sense for her to sabotage her living arrangements
    with the appellant and his spouse, which she sought out and enjoyed, by making
    a false allegation and concluded that the complainant’s testimony about the appellant’s
    apology to her had “the ring of truth.”</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Analysis and Conclusion</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In cases such as this, the Supreme Court of
    Canada has recently cautioned that appellate courts “must not finely parse the trial
    judge’s reasons in search for error”: <em>R. v. G.F.</em>, 2021 SCC 20, at
    para. 69. The Court emphasized both the strong deference due to a trial judge’s
    credibility findings and the presumption that trial judges must be taken to
    know the law. The presumption applies with particular force when it comes to
    settled principles. As the Court said, at para. 75 of <em>G.F</em>., “trial
    judges do not need to provide detailed maps of well-trod paths”. The Court
    further observed, at paras. 76-79, that reasons which are “imperfect” or
    language which is “ambiguous” does not <em>per se</em> require allowing an appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issues raised by the appellant all relate to
    the proper application of bedrock legal principles and fall on the “well-trod”
    path referred to by the Supreme Court of Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s reasons demonstrate an
    understanding of the presumption of innocence and the application of the burden
    of proof faced with irreconcilable versions of events. The trial judge referred
    to the three-step analysis laid down in <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em> early in his
    reasons and instructed himself on the applicable legal principles on at least
    three occasions. He succinctly and accurately put forward the defence – first,
    the appellant’s denials were sufficiently credible to at least raise a doubt;
    second, the complainant’s evidence was not sufficiently reliable to carry the
    burden of proof.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With one exception, the trial judge found the
    evidence of the first two complainants “totally believable”. However, the trial
    judge did not convict on the basis of that assessment, nor did he arrive at
    that conclusion without regard to the appellant’s evidence. While he candidly
    acknowledged that he could not point to anything in the appellant’s denial that
    would cause him to reject the appellant’s evidence regarding the first two
    complainants, he correctly observed the appellant’s evidence was not to be
    assessed in isolation, but rather in the context of the entirety of the
    evidence, including but not restricted to that of the complainants.</span></p>

    1 S.C.R. 307,</span> an accused person is not entitled to an acquittal simply
    because his evidence does not raise any obvious problems. His evidence may be rejected
    “based on considered and reasoned acceptance beyond a reasonable doubt of the
    truth of conflicting credible evidence” which may provide “as much an
    explanation for the rejection of an accused’s evidence as is a rejection based
    on a problem identified with the way the accused testified or the substance of
    the accused’s evidence”: <em>R. v. J.J.R.D. </em>(2006)<em>, </em>218 O.A.C. 37

    the evidence of the third complainant as demonstrating that she had no motive
    to fabricate. The appellant argues this was not a case of proved absence of
    motive, but rather a case of the absence of evidence of a motive to fabricate.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, the trial judge’s observation that
    the third complainant “appears to have no motive to make false allegation” was
    not a finding that the Crown had proved there was no motive, as the appellant
    suggests, but rather that the third complainant had no apparent motive to fabricate
    her evidence. It was open to the trial judge to make that finding and take it
    into account when assessing the third complainant’s credibility. In any event,
    the trial judge’s consideration of whether she had a motive to fabricate
    appears to have played a very minor role in his credibility assessment.</span></p>
