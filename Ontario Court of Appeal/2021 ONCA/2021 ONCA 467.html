  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Mr. Krebs, appeals from a decision of a motion judge
    declaring that a cohabitation agreement with the respondent, Ms. Cote, was of
    no force and effect.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the motion judge erred (i) in concluding that
    a reconciliation terminates a cohabitation agreement, (ii) in failing to
    interpret the whole of the plain language of the contract in the factual
    context existing when it was signed, and (iii) in concluding that a payment
    made pursuant to the agreement exhausted the terms of the rest of the agreement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent supports the motion judge’s decision. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both parties had independent legal advice before signing the
    cohabitation agreement and there is no challenge to the validity of the
    agreement.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BACKGROUND</h1>
  <p class=Heading>Family History</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties began an “off-and-on-again” relationship in 2006, with
    numerous separations. This continued in 2012-2013 when the parties separated on
    a few occasions. In October 2012, the respondent’s mother purchased a home in
    which her daughter could reside. In December 2012 or January 2013, the parties
    decided to resume cohabitation and, during this period, entered into the
    cohabitation agreement that is the subject of this appeal. The respondent moved
    out of the appellant’s home shortly thereafter. The appellant paid her $5,000,
    pursuant to the agreement, for vacant possession of his home.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties reconciled in the first half of 2014. In June 2014, they
    married and the respondent moved back into the appellant’s home. The parties
    discussed adding the respondent to the title to the matrimonial home in 2016,
    but that was ultimately not pursued.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relationship broke down for the final time in January 2019. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Notice of Motion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent brought a motion seeking the following relief:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>An order for summary judgment to
    decide a question of law before trial pursuant to Rule 16(12)(a) of the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Family Law Rules</span></em>. Specifically, an Order that the
    Cohabitation Agreement executed by the parties in December 2012 (Applicant) and
    January 2013 (Respondent) is invalid, not binding on the parties and is of no
    force or effect.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question of law that the parties wanted the motion judge to decide
    was whether, as a matter of law, separation followed by reconciliation
    terminated a cohabitation agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the notice of motion was confined to a question of law, the motion judge went
    on to make findings about the subjective intentions of the parties, and to
    interpret the agreement. However, interpretation of a contract is a matter of
    mixed fact and law: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Creston Moly Corp. v. Sattva Capital
    Corp.</span></em>, 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, at para. 50. The motion
    proceeded on the basis of an agreed statement of facts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    parties ask that, if necessary, this court interpret the agreement rather than
    sending this back for a new hearing, despite the limitations of the notice of motion. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Motion Judge’s Decision</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that the cohabitation agreement was of no force or
    effect for three reasons.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The common law principle holding that reconciliation terminated a
    separation agreement applied to cohabitation agreements.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The discussion about transferring title to the matrimonial home to the
    respondent in 2016 showed that the parties did not subjectively intend that
    their cohabitation agreement would continue to apply in the event of a
    separation and reconciliation. This was, he held, “sufficient to rebut any
    presumption to the contrary.” The motion judge went on to note that nothing in
    the agreed facts supported an intention that the agreement would be applicable
    if there was a reconciliation, and nothing in the agreement expressly dealt
    with the effects of a separation and reconciliation.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cohabitation agreement provided that upon breakdown of the
    relationship, the respondent would vacate the home owned by the appellant which
    the parties were then occupying as their home on 30 days’ written notice and
    upon payment by the appellant to the respondent of $5,000 payable on the date
    she left the property. The motion judge held that the consideration for the
    $5,000 payment was the respondent’s relocation from the matrimonial home and
    that, since that triggering event had occurred and payment made, the terms of
    the cohabitation agreement were exhausted. </p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not agree with the motion judge’s
    conclusion that a cohabitation agreement does not apply to the parties after a
    separation followed by reconciliation unless the agreement expressly provides
    to the contrary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is well-established that, at common law, a separation
    agreement becomes void upon reconciliation of the parties, subject to any
    clause in the separation agreement overriding the common law rule or which
    would imply that the intent of the parties was that terms of the separation
    agreement would be carried out notwithstanding any subsequent reconciliation:
    see <em><span lang=EN-CA>Ernikos v. Ernikos</span></em>, 2017 ONCA 347, at
    para. 11; <em><span lang=EN-CA>Sydor v. Sydor </span></em>(2003), 178 O.A.C.
    155 (C.A.), para. 22; <em><span lang=EN-CA>Bailey v. Bailey</span></em> (1982), <span lang=EN-CA>37 O.R. (2d) 117 (C.A); <em>Bebenek v. Bebenek</em> (1979), 24
    O.R. (2d) 385 (C.A.).</span><span lang=EN-CA> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would not extend the common law rule to cohabitation agreements. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    common law rule is ancient. In <em><span lang=EN-CA>Nicol v. Nicol</span></em> (1885), 30 Ch. D. 143, at p. 145, North J. of the Chancery Division explained
    the rationale for the common law rule that reconciliation brings a separation
    agreement to an end:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I&nbsp;think it
    clearly established by numerous authorities (no case in any way conflicting
    with them), that where a separation arrangement is made pure and simple, that
    arrangement is for the term of the separation, and for no longer. It comes to
    an end when the separation ends, not because the fact of reconciliation or
    recohabitation makes it void, but it dies a natural death. The agreement was to
    provide for a state of things which has come to an end, the state of things
    being that the parties were living separate although married. When they live
    together again as man and wife the state of things is totally different, and
    the arrangement comes to an end.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The rule was not absolute and depended on an
    interpretation of the parties’ intentions, as evinced by the whole of the
    agreement. For example, where a separation agreement had separation for one of
    its objects but also other matters within its purview, such as settlement of
    property issues, those aspects of the agreement may continue despite a return
    to cohabitation. As described by Montague Lush and Walter Hussey Griffith in <em>Law
    of Husband and Wife</em> <em>within the Jurisdiction of the King’s Bench &amp;
    Chancery Divisions</em>, 3rd ed. (London: Stevens and Sons, Limited, 1910), at
    pp. 461-463: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[I]t is a well-established principle of law
    that a separation deed properly so called</span><span lang=EN-CA>—</span><i><span
lang=EN-CA>i.e</span></i><span lang=EN-CA>., a separation deed whose only object
    is to provide for the parties living apart from one another</span><span
lang=EN-CA>—</span><span lang=EN-CA>is <em>ipso facto</em> put an end to for
    all future purposes if the parties subsequently become reconciled and return to
    cohabitation.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>This principle is too well known and too plain
    to require observation. <span class=Underline>For the very nature and object of
    the instrument is to provide for a state of circumstances which comes to an end
    on a cesser of the separation</span>. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>But a separation deed the primary object of
    which is to provide for the parties living apart may have also a secondary
    object—viz., that of effecting a permanent settlement of property to continue
    not only during the separation but in any event. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span
lang=EN-CA>The question whether a deed is a separation deed which will be
    avoided upon a return to cohabitation or a post-nuptial settlement which will
    continue valid notwithstanding a return to cohabitation turns upon the
    intention of the parties to be gathered from the terms of the deed</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>. [Emphasis added. Internal citations omitted.] </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    common law rule dates from a time when views about marriage, cohabitation,
    separation, and divorce were very different. At one time, separation agreements
    were considered “contrary to public policy.” To cohabit without the benefit of
    marriage was “to live in sin.” The courts of equity would not enforce an
    executory separation agreement, i.e. one entered before the separation, though
    in contemplation of a future separation. Cohabitation for even a short time
    after execution of the agreement rendered the deed of separation void: see <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Law of Husband and Wife</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-style:normal'>, at</span></em> p. 457.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Today</span>, marriage contracts, cohabitation agreements, and
    separation agreements are all part of the legislative landscape: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Family Law Act</span></em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, ss. 52-54. Parties
    should be encouraged to enter agreements to define their rights and obligations.
    Jurisprudential shoals upon which an agreement may founder unnecessarily do not
    advance that goal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notwithstanding the sea change in family law over the past
    century, the common law reconciliation rule remains a part of Canadian common
    law and continues to make some sense. Where the <em><span lang=EN-CA>raison
    d’être</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> of the agreement is separation and parties
    reconcile, the foundation for the separation agreement dissolves. I see no
    basis to extend this logic so as to void a cohabitation agreement following
    reconciliation of the parties. Under such circumstances, the reconciled parties
    have returned to the very state contemplated by the cohabitation agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Langdon v. Langdon</em>, 2015 MBQB 153, 321
    Man. R. (2d) 52, Little J. remarked, in <em>obiter</em>, that he was “far from
    certain” that reconciliation should affect a cohabitation agreement in the same
    manner as a separation agreement. He explained, at paras. 138-140: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I do not think it a proper inference or
    presumption to say that a resumption of cohabitation nullifies [a cohabitation
    agreement] concerning a property and support regime. Renewed cohabitation in
    that context is more reflective of an intention to return to a relationship
    where one's rights were formerly delineated by the agreement. It does not seem
    to me to be at all reflective of an intention to enhance one party's rights or
    to impose greater obligations on the other, something that will inevitably
    result when the cohabitation agreement no longer exists.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It seems to me
    that if there is to be an inference or a presumption at all it ought to be
    (barring other evidence of intention) that the resumption of cohabitation
    returns you to the position you held in the relationship to which you have now
    chosen to return. Presuming the termination of the cohabitation agreement on
    resumption of cohabitation could lead to strategic separations and
    reconciliations designed to nullify cohabitation agreements. It also results in
    a policy requiring redocumentation on resumption of cohabitation.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I do not regard the first as good policy; the

    Sandrelli</em>, 2015 ONSC 7913, 72 R.F.L. (7th) 135, observing that case held,
    at para. 32, that “[d]ischarge of a contract by performance describes the
    situation where the contract comes to an end when both parties perform their
    contractual obligations in the manner prescribed by the contract”. The motion
    judge noted that case suggested “if the parties intend the agreement to
    continue after they reconcile the agreement needs to state that,” citing <em>Sandrelli</em>,
    at para. 41. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    case about a cohabitation agreement that explicitly contained a clause
    providing for disposition of property upon the happening of certain “triggering
    events” including “where the parties ceased to cohabit for a period of greater
    than 90 days.” Again, the motion judge in that case approached the matter from
    the stance that the common law rule applicable to separation agreements applied.
    She noted that the cohabitation agreement did not provide for reinstatement
    upon reconciliation following a triggering event and that there was no
    presumption in law that a reconciliation revives a cohabitation agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent relies on <em>Sandrelli</em> to
    argue that the payment by the appellant to the respondent of $5,000 was a
    similar triggering event which brought the agreement to an end. Counsel for the
    respondent analogizes this to an employment contract calling for payment to an employee
    on termination. Once the payment is made, the terms are fulfilled and there is
    no scope for further operation of the contract. If the employee returns to
    work, in this analogy, the parties cannot rely on the old contract; they must
    enter a new agreement.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would respond that the question of the scope
    of the contract and its application depends on the language of the contract and
    the interpretation given to that language. Adopting the respondent’s analogy, if
    the same employment contract called for releases, there is no doubt that those
    releases would be enforced despite payment as envisaged by the contract. If
    there was a non-competition promise contained in the agreement, that too would likely
    be enforceable. In some sense, the approach advocated by the respondent is
    tautological. The agreement comes to an end when there is nothing left to bind
    the parties, i.e., when it comes to an end. In any event, the analogy is not
    perfectly apt, as employment is a contractual relationship, while cohabitation
    is not necessarily so. </span></p>

    would conclude that the broad language of the cohabitation agreement evinces an
    objective intention to have the agreement apply in general to cohabitation,
    including that which follows a separation and reconciliation. One could
    reasonably conclude that the $5,000 payment was intended to assist the
    respondent with a move to her own accommodation.</span></p>
