  <p class=Heading><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Paciocco J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Michael Norwood (Michael) faced narcotics-related
    criminal charges, but died before he could stand trial. As a result of those
    charges, and before Michaels death, the Attorney General of Canada (Canada) seized
    Michaels home at 11 Cassone Court (the Cassone Court property) and commenced
    proceedings to secure its forfeiture. Pending Canadas forfeiture proceedings,
    the Cassone Court property was sold on consent. The proceeds were paid into
    Canadas Seized Property Management Directorate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After Michaels death, Canada terminated its
    forfeiture proceedings. Before the proceeds of sale of the Cassone Court property
    could be returned to Michaels estate, the Attorney General of Ontario
    (Ontario) commenced proceedings under the <em>Civil Remedies Act, 2001</em><i>, </i>S.O. 2001, c. 28 (the <em>Civil Remedies Act</em> or the Act), seeking its
    own forfeiture order. The proceeds of sale of the Cassone Court property were subsequently
    paid into court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Michaels mother, Rosa Norwood (Rosa), notified
    Ontario of her claim to an interest in the Cassone Court property. Before
    Ontarios forfeiture claim could be resolved, Ontario agreed with Rosa that she
    should receive $120,000 from the sale proceeds. On May 6, 2020, pursuant to s.
    18.1 of the <em>Civil Remedies Act</em>, Ontario moved for approval of this proposed
    settlement. Michaels estate (the Estate) and 947014 Ontario Inc. (947),
    a company Michael controlled before his death, opposed Ontarios motion and the
    payment of funds to Rosa. On June 4, 2020, the motion judge granted an order
    approving the settlement between Ontario and Rosa, which required payment of $120,000
    to Rosas counsel in trust.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Estate and 947 are the appellants in this
    appeal. Ontario is the respondent. Rosa is an interested party and relies on
    Ontarios submissions; she advanced no oral or written submissions of her own.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants contend that the motion judge
    erred in approving the agreement between Ontario and Rosa prior to a judicial
    determination that Ontarios forfeiture claim was successful.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree. In my view, properly interpreted, to
    constitute a settlement in relation to a proceeding under this Act in the
    meaning of s. 18.1(1) of the <em>Civil Remedies Act</em>, the proposed agreement
    must relate to the <em>in rem</em> property interests being litigated in the underlying
    forfeiture proceedings. Although Ontario and Rosa could settle their relative <em>in
    personam</em> claims, they could not, between themselves, settle the <em>in rem</em><i> </i>interests of others, such as the Estates interest in the Cassone Court
    property. Put another way, their so-called settlement was not a settlement in
    the meaning of the Act at all, and therefore not properly subject to judicial
    approval under s. 18.1.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Things would have been different, however, if before
    approving the agreement the motion judge had determined that the sale proceeds
    of the Cassone Court property were the proceeds and/or instruments of unlawful
    activity, and that forfeiture was not clearly contrary to the interests of
    justice. Such a determination would have given Ontario a higher right to the Cassone
    Court property to the exclusion of all others, subject to Rosas outstanding
    claim that she was a legitimate or responsible owner. Ontario and Rosa
    could then have entered into an agreement resolving the <em>in rem</em><i> </i>property
    interests in the proceeds of the Cassone Court property being litigated in the forfeiture
    proceedings under the <em>Civil</em><i> <em>Remedies</em> <em>Act</em></i>, an
    agreement which would have constituted a settlement in the meaning of s. 18.1.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Put simply, absent a finding of unlawful
    activity, there was no settlement in relation to a proceeding under [the] Act
    between Ontario and Rosa for the motion judge to approve. Therefore, I conclude
    that the motion judge erred in approving the agreement between Ontario and Rosa.
    Accordingly, I would set aside the motion judges order of June 4, 2020.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>MATERIAL FACTS &amp; PROCEEDINGS BELOW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 7, 1993, Michael acquired the property
    at 11 Cassone Court, Ottawa (formerly Nepean). On September 22, 1995, a charge
    was registered against the Cassone Court property in favour of Michaels
    mother, Rosa. Rosas charge against the Cassone Court property was discharged twelve
    years later, on October 10, 2007.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Procedural history leading to the settlement
    approval motion</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In February 2015, after a prolonged
    drug-trafficking investigation, Michaels Cassone Court residence was searched
    and the property itself was seized. So too was the Silver Dollar nightclub, which
    Michael owned and operated through 947.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a result of its investigation, Canada laid drug-related
    charges against Michael, and instituted forfeiture proceedings against the
    Cassone Court property and the Silver Dollar, pursuant to s. 17 of the <em>Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c. 19, and ss. 462.38(2) and 490(9)
    of the <em>Criminal</em><i> <em>Code</em></i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 19, 2015, Canada obtained a restraint
    order relating to the seized properties. The next day, October 20, 2015, Michael
    executed a promissory note in favour of Rosa in the amount of $138,000. On
    October 23, 2015, Michael directed his counsel to register a collateral charge
    against the Cassone Court property in Rosas name, also for $138,000.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Rosa claims that the promissory note and collateral
    charge retroactively evidenced an informal arrangement between herself and Michael,
    dating back to the mid-1990s, through which she provided her son with $138,000.
    Rosa asserts that, in return, Michael renovated the Cassone Court property to
    provide her with an apartment, promised her she could reside there until her
    death, and agreed to repay her from the proceeds of sale if the property were ever
    sold. However, when Rosa attempted to register the collateral charge, she was
    unsuccessful because Canadas restraint order against the Cassone Court property
    was in place.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Subsequently, Michael and Canada agreed that the
    Cassone Court property would be sold. The sale closed in July 2016 for
    $243,098.88. The net proceeds of sale were paid into Canadas Seized Property
    Management Directorate, along with the net proceeds of the Silver Dollar, which
    had also been sold.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 4, 2016, an order was made releasing
    some of the property Canada had seized from Michael to his criminal lawyer to
    assist in paying his legal fees, including $105,099 of the proceeds of sale of
    the Cassone Court property: <em>R. v. Norwood</em>, 2016 ONSC 6207. In making
    that order, Parfett J. (who was not the motion judge who made the order now
    under appeal), found that Michael had a possessory right in the seized
    property [including the Cassone Court property] to the exclusion of anyone else
    and no other means or assets with which to pay his legal expenses: at para.
    30.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Michael died around one year later, on October
    17, 2017. On February 8, 2019, Canada secured another order from Parfett J. terminating
    its forfeiture proceedings and ordering the return of the remaining proceeds of
    sale of the Cassone Court property, approximately $145,000 plus interest, to the
    Estate.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Ontarios forfeiture application and Rosas
    claim</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On February 15, 2019, before the proceeds contemplated
    in Parfett J.s order could be paid to the Estate, Ontario began forfeiture
    proceedings pursuant to the <em>Civil Remedies Act</em> relating to the
    proceeds of sale of both the Cassone Court property and the Silver Dollar.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On February 21, 2019, Rosas counsel wrote to
    Ontario to advance Rosas $138,000 claim against the proceeds of sale from the Cassone
    Court property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 7, 2019, Ontario obtained an interim
    preservation order relating to the proceeds of sale of the Cassone Court
    property and the Silver Dollar. That preservation order was renewed, on consent,
    in October 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The proposed settlement and the settlement
    approval motion</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 24, 2020, Ontario made an offer to
    settle Rosas claimed interest in the forfeiture proceedings by payment of
    $120,000 from the proceeds of sale of the Cassone Court property. The Estate
    rejected the offer. Rosa accepted it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 6, 2020, Ontario brought an urgent
    motion pursuant to s. 18.1 of the <em>Civil Remedies Act</em><i> </i>for
    approval of its proposed settlement with Rosa. The motion was heard before Ontario
    had served an application record setting out the evidentiary basis for its
    underlying forfeiture application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Estate opposed the approval motion,
    contending that Rosas claim was without merit. It maintained that, by hearing
    the motion before the Estate could challenge the forfeiture proceedings, the
    court would effectively deprive the Estate of a defence in those proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The order under appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    order under appeal do not disclose a detailed exercise of statutory
    interpretation relating to s. 18.1. Notably, the motion judges reasons do not
    expressly contemplate whether he had the authority to approve the proposed settlement
    between Ontario and Rosa. The sole basis the motion judge offered for rejecting
    the Estates submission that the approval motion should not be heard in the
    face of an outstanding contested forfeiture application was that s. 18.1
    confers courts with a broad power to approve settlements. In support of his
    view, the motion judge stated that [n]otably, it is not required [under s.
    18.1] that any amount to be paid out of the preserved funds be first
    established to be proceeds of crime.</span></p>

    under s. 18.1 of the <em>Civil Remedies Act</em> did not require a prior
    determination that the funds seized were the proceeds of unlawful activity.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellants argue that Rosa is not a
    legitimate owner or responsible owner of the Cassone Court property, but a
    mere creditor incapable of entering into a settlement within the meaning of s.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the appellants submit that the motion
    judge erred in deciding the approval motion based on hearsay evidence from a

    judges findings that I need not recount.</span></p>

    forfeiture occurs and the consequential transfer of property from the owner to
    the Crown has taken place, Ontarios rights in the subject property do not
    materialize, nor are the rights of others expunged.</span></p>

    Ontarios position. In fact, it is consistent with the <em>in rem</em><i> </i>settlement
    interpretation I have just described. In <em>$80 Cdn.</em>, one of five
    respondents to Ontarios s. 18.1 settlement approval motion, Ms. Flynn, was the
    registered owner of a vehicle from which the subject property was seized. Nicholson
    J. approved a settlement between Ontario and Ms. Flynn releasing some of the subject
    property to her, but not before satisfying himself on the balance of
    probabilities that all the property at issue was either the proceeds or an

    Weldrick Road West (in rem)</em>, 2020 ONSC 4605, Ontario sought the forfeiture
    of property as either the proceeds or instruments of unlawful activity. Ontario
    entered into an agreement to release a motor vehicle and around $280,000 out of
    approximately $550,000 liquidated from seized assets to a claimant whose common
    law spouse had been convicted of fraud and forgery offences. Ontario maintained
    that Sanfilippo J. could approve the agreement without inquiring into the
    substantive requirements of the <em>Civil</em><i> <em>Remedies</em> <em>Act</em></i>,
    including whether the subject property was the proceeds or instruments of
    unlawful activity. Sanfilippo J. disagreed. Like Nicholson J. in <em>$80 Cdn.</em>,
    before approving the settlement Sanfilippo J. made a finding on the balance of
    probabilities that the subject property was either the proceeds or instruments
    of unlawful activity: at para. 27.</span></p>

    were correct to make the requisite unlawful activity findings before approving
    the proposed settlements before them. As I have indicated and will explain in
    more detail below, the need for a finding of unlawful activity arises from a
    correct statutory interpretation of the words a settlement in relation to a proceeding

    stated the core rule in <em>R. v. Stipo</em>, 2019 ONCA 3, 144 O.R. (3d) 145,
    at paras. 175-76:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is well settled that statutory
    interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of the legislation alone.
    Instead, the approach is that advocated by Elmer Driedger in his <em>Construction
    of Statutes</em><i> </i>(2nd ed., 1983):</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Today there is only one principle
    or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context
    and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the
    Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>See, <em>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v.

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>This preferred approach recognizes the
    significant role that context must play when courts construe the written words
    of a statute. No statutory provision is an island in itself. Its words take
    their colour from their surroundings: <em>Bell ExpressVu</em>, at para. 27. All
    issues of statutory interpretation involve the fundamental question of what
    Parliament intended. To discover what Parliament intended, we look at the words
    of the provision, informed by its history, context and purpose: <em>R. v. Mabior</em>,
    2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at para. 20.</span></p>

    statutory interpretation, as articulated in <em>Stipo</em>,<i> </i>favours its proposed
    interpretation of s. 18.1. It advances three supporting arguments in this
    regard: (1) the ordinary and grammatical meaning of s. 18.1(1) gives courts
    broad discretion to approve settlements without a prior finding of unlawful
    activity; (2) this broad interpretation aligns with the object and purpose of
    the Act and the intention of the legislature; and (3) the expansive authority flowing

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ontario urges us to have confidence that the
    broad settlement authority it claims s. 18.1 provides will not be used unfairly
    because, (a) the Attorney General, in his or her dual role as Minister of
    Justice, is obliged to act fairly and in the public interest when agreeing to
    settlements, and (b) judges must exercise their discretion reasonably in
    approving settlements.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not accept this submission. The fact
    that the Attorney General is also the Minister of Justice and therefore bound to
    act reasonably and responsibly is irrelevant to the proper interpretation of s.
    18.1. The underlying challenge in interpreting a legislative provision is to
    identify the meaning intended by the legislation. The task is not to determine
    whether a public official with delegated legislative power would properly exercise
    that power.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the same reason, the fact that judicial
    discretion must be exercised reasonably is equally irrelevant in identifying
    the proper interpretation of legislation. Our interpretive task with respect to
    s. 18.1 is to determine the reach of the legal authority that the legislation
    confers on the judge asked to approve a settlement. Confidence that appellate review
    is available if a judge acts unreasonably within the scope of the authority conferred
    by legislation plays no role in the interpretation of that legislation. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ontario also argues that the ordinary and
    grammatical meaning of s. 18.1 is clear and gives courts broad discretion to
    approve any settlement in a forfeiture proceeding. Ontario points out that s. 18.1(1)
    does not expressly require a finding that the subject property is the proceeds
    or an instrument of unlawful activity before a settlement may be approved. In
    making this submission, Ontario relies on the opening words of s. 18.1(1):
    Despite anything to the contrary in this Act, the court may approve a
    settlement. It calls this phrase unambiguously expansive, arguing that the
    phrase, and indeed s. 18.1 itself, would be rendered meaningless if settlements
    could be approved only after a finding of unlawful activity has been made. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept Ontarios position that the
    grammatical and ordinary meaning of the words used in s. 18.1 supports its proposed
    expansive interpretation. The words of the Act are to be read in their entire
    context. Section 18.1(1) does not simply say, Despite anything to the contrary
    in this Act, the court may approve a settlement. Crucially, it provides that,
    Despite anything to the contrary in this Act, the court may approve a <u>settlement
    in relation to a proceeding under this Act</u> (emphasis added). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this regard, it is important to recall that a
    proceeding under the applicable parts of the <em>Civil Remedies Ac</em><i>t</i> is an </span><span class=EmphasisUnderlineChar><span lang=EN-CA>in rem</span></span><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>proceeding engaged to settle title to property
    that is allegedly linked to unlawful activity. It is not an </span><span
class=EmphasisUnderlineChar><span lang=EN-CA>in personam</span></span><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>proceeding conducted to resolve disputes
    between individuals about their relative rights. When the words a settlement in
    relation to a proceeding under this Act are read in this context, it is clear that
    they describe a settlement that relates to the <i>in rem</i> interests in the property
    being litigated in the proceedings. This is what I have already characterized
    as the <em>in rem</em><i> </i>settlement interpretation. In my view, to
    constitute a settlement relating to the <em>in rem</em><i> </i>interests in
    the property, an agreement must resolve the <em>in rem</em><i> </i>rights in
    the subject property. In other words, it must be capable of settling, to the
    exclusion of all others, the rights of the parties before the approving judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Quite clearly, the agreement between Ontario and
    Rosa could not resolve the <em>in rem</em><i> </i>rights in the subject
    property. Even leaving aside the potential <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>interests
    of non-parties to the litigation, the Estate claims an interest in the proceeds
    of sale of the Cassone Court property that has not been displaced by any
    forfeiture order. An agreement between Ontario and Rosa might well settle their
    personal dispute relating to ownership of the Cassone Court property, but that
    agreement is incapable of resolving the Estates <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>rights
    in that property. Therefore, on a proper contextual, grammatical, and ordinary reading
    of the language of s. 18.1, in my view the agreement between Ontario and Rosa
    could not be a settlement in relation to a proceeding under this Act.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I see nothing in the language of s. 18.1 or
    elsewhere in the Act that could alter this conclusion. Section 18.1 does not,
    by its terms, authorize some of the parties in the <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>proceeding
    to settle the <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>claims of all others in the
    subject property. The only authority s. 18.1 provides is that of courts to
    approve settlements in relation to a proceeding under this Act. Since I would
    find that the personal agreement between Ontario and Rosa is not a settlement
    within the meaning of s. 18.1, the motion judge had no authority under s. 18.1(1)
    to approve that agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Things would be different, however, if before
    approving the agreement the motion judge had made a finding that the proceeds
    of sale of the Cassone Court property were proceeds and/or instruments of
    unlawful activity and that forfeiture was clearly not contrary to the interests
    of justice. Had that determination been made, subject to Rosas outstanding
    claim that she was a legitimate or responsible owner, Ontario would have had
    a claim to the subject property to the exclusion of all others, including the Estate.
    Since, in this scenario, only Ontario and Rosa would have had outstanding
    claims to the Cassone Court property, they could have agreed to settle the <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>interests in that property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ontario resists the <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>settlement
    interpretation just described. It argues that to require an unlawful activity
    finding before a settlement can be approved would denude s. 18.1 of meaning. If
    Ontario were right about this, the <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>settlement
    interpretation would be contrary to the well accepted principle of statutory
    interpretation that no legislative provision should be interpreted so as to
    render it mere surplusage: <em>R v. Proulx</em>, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R.
    61, at para. 28.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, I do not agree with Ontario on this
    point. Once a determination has been made that the subject property is linked
    to the applicable unlawful activity, the grammatical and ordinary language of s.
    18.1 permits a wide range of settlements between Ontario and those asserting
    claims to the property. As I have indicated, if Ontario had shown that the
    proceeds of the Cassone Court property are the proceeds and/or instruments of
    unlawful activity, Ontario would have been free to settle with Rosa on the
    agreed upon terms, or any other lawful terms.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, I do not accept Ontarios position
    that this interpretation renders meaningless the phrase, Despite anything to
    the contrary in this Act. Once Ontario establishes the requisite link between
    the subject property and unlawful activity to support forfeiture, this broad
    language empowers courts to approve any settlement that Ontario enters into,
    even where the agreed outcomes are not otherwise contemplated by the Act. As
    Nicholson J. explained in <em>$80 Cdn.</em>, at para. 29, s. 18.1 now permits courts
    to approve settlements based on compromise between the parties, thereby avoiding
    all or nothing outcomes. This kind of compromise settlement was not
    permissible prior to the passage of s. 18.1, as confirmed by Nordheimer J.s 2017
    decision in <em>$29,900 in Canadian Currency (in rem)</em>.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 18.1 also now permits courts to approve
    settlements that approximate a claimed amount, without a determination of the
    precise entitlement contemplated by the <em>Civil Remedies Act</em>: <em>$80
    Cdn.</em>, at paras. 32-33. Moreover, under s. 18.1 courts may approve payments
    to claimants without first showing that their claim as an uninvolved interest
    holder or responsible owner has merit: <em>$80 Cdn.</em>, at para. 31.<a

    in <em>$29,900 in Canadian Currency (in rem)</em>, at para. 36, are apt: [I]t
    is necessary to ensure that the interests of the legitimate owner of property,
    that is seized under this statute, are not trampled over by a rush to conclude
    the proceeding.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, Ontarios interpretation cannot find
    support in legislative intention. As Watt J.A. instructed in <em>Stipo</em>, at
    para. 175, To discover what Parliament intended, we look at the words of the
    provision, informed by its history, context and purpose. As I have just
    described, the context and purpose of s. 18.1 are not in keeping with Ontarios
    proposed interpretation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor does the history of s. 18.1 support Ontarios
    interpretation. I do agree with Ontarios submission that s. 18.1 was enacted
    in response to Nordheimer J.s decision in <em>$29,900 in Canadian Currency (in
    rem)</em><i> </i>and that this history strongly suggests that the legislature
    intended s. 18.1 to redress the shortcoming exposed in that decision, namely,
    the inability of judges, <u>after making the requisite unlawful activity
    finding</u>, to order anything other than full forfeiture unless one of the two
    statutory exceptions is satisfied. However, that shortcoming can be overcome
    without interpreting s. 18.1 as Ontario contends, which would confer judicial
    discretion to approve proposed settlements entered into by some parties to forfeiture
    proceedings even where those settlements purport to eradicate the <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>property interests of others.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Indeed, the shortcoming exposed in <em>$29,900
    in Canadian Currency (in rem)</em><i> </i>can be resolved through the <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>settlement interpretation, which would empower judges, <u>after
    making the requisite unlawful activity finding</u>, to make orders other than
    full forfeiture. Simply put, Ontarios proposed interpretation of s. 18.1 goes
    further than required to satisfy the apparent historical objective of the
    provision, whereas the <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>settlement
    interpretation is better targeted to achieve that historical objective.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The legislature did not intend for s. 18.1 to
    produce absurd consequences</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would offer one additional point related to
    the legislatures intention in enacting s. 18.1 of the <em>Civil Remedies Act</em>.
    The absurdity principle (often called the golden rule of statutory
    interpretation), holds that if an interpretation would lead to an absurdity, a
    court may reject it in favour of a plausible alternative which avoids the
    absurdity: <em>Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd.</em> [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1031, at
    para. 65; <em>Schnarr v. Blue Mountain Resorts Limited</em>, 2018 ONCA 313, 140
    O.R. (3d) 241, at para. 72, leave to appeal refused, [2018] S.C.C.A. No. 187; Sullivan,

lang=EN-CA>Where a potential absurdity is identified, </span><span lang=EN-CA>Gonthier
    J. explained the relevant interpretive exercise as follows, at para. 65 of <em>Canadian</em><i> <em>Pacific</em></i>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>One method of avoiding absurdity is through
    the strict interpretation of general words  Where a provision is open to two
    or more interpretations, the absurdity principle may be employed to reject
    interpretations which lead to negative consequences, as such consequences are
    presumed to have been unintended by the legislature.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The absurdity principle, as articulated above, reinforces my view to
    reject Ontarios proposed interpretation in favour of the <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>settlement interpretation. I have already </span><span lang=EN-CA>explored
    the incompatibility between Ontarios interpretation and the object of the Act;
    I need say no more on this point. However, at least two additional forms of
    absurdity recounted by Watt J.A. in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Stipo</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>could apply.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, Ontarios interpretation is illogical and incoherent. It will
    be recalled that the motion judge approved a settlement in which Rosa was to be
    paid <u>some</u>, not all, of the sale proceeds of the Cassone Court property.
    If the order under appeal were to stand, in order to resolve what is to happen
    to the balance of those proceeds, an adjudicated hearing would be required to
    determine whether forfeiture is appropriate. What if, at that hearing, the court
    found that Ontario had not met its burden of establishing that the sale
    proceeds of the Cassone Court property are the proceeds and/or instruments of
    crime? Would Rosa be entitled to keep the $120,000, or would she have to return
    it?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Ontario could not answer these questions. As I see it, neither
    alternative is logical or coherent. If Rosa were permitted to keep the money,
    under a proceeds of crime statute she would have received property that is not
    the proceeds or instruments of crime. If she were required to return the money,
    even leaving aside the logistical problems this would present, the law would,
    illogically and incoherently, be treating the settlement as having been lawful
    pursuant to s. 18.1, yet invalid. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second, Ontarios interpretation would produce extremely
    unreasonable or inequitable outcomes. I am certain I have already betrayed my
    conviction that it would be unreasonable and inequitable in the extreme to
    permit courts to approve settlements between Ontario and others that deprive
    third parties of their rights in private property, without any inquiry into
    whether the subject property was tainted by unlawful activity. This outcome,
    which violates due process, is not merely hypothetical. It is the very position
    Ontario seeks to uphold in this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Indeed, Ontario argues before us that s. 18.1 enables it to seek
    court approval for settlements it enters into with anyone authorized to receive
    payments from a special purpose account, pursuant to ss. 6 and 11 of the Act,
    without the need for prior judicial determination that the property was tainted
    by unlawful activity. If Ontario is correct, it would be permitted to seek
    approval for settlements it arrives at with alleged victims of entirely
    unproven crimes to compensate them using money that legally belongs to a
    suspect from whom it has been seized. In my view, if this court were to accept
    Ontarios proposed interpretation, the potential for well-intentioned but
    abusive settlements is palpable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In contrast, there is nothing absurd about the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>in</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>rem</span></em></i><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>settlement interpretation of s. 18.1 I
    have described. I do not accept Ontarios objection that this interpretation
    would bar the release of seized property to a claimant without a judicial
    determination on unlawful activity. Ontario can accomplish the release of
    seized property by simply abandoning its application. Where there is common
    ground that some of the seized property is not, in fact, tainted by unlawful
    activity, or that a claimant is, in fact, an uninvolved interest holder or
    responsible owner and therefore exclusively entitled to the property interest
    they claim, Ontario can accomplish the release of that property by withdrawing
    the forfeiture proceedings against it, pursuant to s. 1.7 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Civil Remedies Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Nor do I accept Ontarios submission that the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>in</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>rem</span></em></i><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>settlement interpretation would require
    a full hearing on the merits, even where all interested parties consent or
    agree to the proposed settlement. In that scenario, where no one opposes the
    settlement, the requisite hearing is apt to be simple and efficient. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In sum, applying the golden rule against absurd consequences, in my
    view Ontarios interpretation must be rejected in favour of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>in</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>rem</span></em></i><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>settlement interpretation.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>In light of the foregoing application of the modern approach to

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In explaining the link between this general presumption of strict
    construction and state confiscation of private property, Cory J. said as
    follows in <em>Toronto Area Transit Operating Authority v. Dell Holdings Ltd.</em>,
    [1997] 1 S.C.R. 32, at para. 20:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The expropriation of property is one of the
    ultimate exercises of governmental authority. To take all or part of a persons
    property constitutes a severe loss and a very significant interference with a

    expropriating authority should be strictly construed in favour of those whose rights
    have been affected.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, the presumption of strict construction favours the <i>in

    were persuaded that the provision could support both interpretations on a

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>CONCLUSION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Properly interpreted, to constitute a settlement in relation to a

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Since Ontario did not establish that the proceeds of sale from the

    instruments of unlawful activity, it never acquired a higher claim to the <em>in</em><i> <em>rem</em> </i>rights in that property than all non-parties to its agreement
    with Rosa. It follows that Ontarios agreement with Rosa was not a settlement

class=FootnoteTextEmphasisChar>269 Weldrick Road West (in rem)</span>, 2020
    ONSC 4605, at paras. 18, 23, 29. When Sanfilippo J. held that he could not
    approve a settlement without first deciding whether the claimant was a lawful
    owner, he had not been alerted that s. 18.1 was not in force when the
    Divisional Court decision in <span class=FootnoteTextEmphasisChar>$29,900 in

    bound by that decision. Sanfilippo J. subsequently issued a supplementary

    was enacted after the decision in <span class=FootnoteTextEmphasisChar>$29,900
    in Canadian Currency (in rem)</span>, this might have affected the analysis

    correct to insist on proof that the seized property was either the proceeds of
    unlawful activity or the instrument of unlawful activity, and that he was

    his reasoning relate to his insistence that, before he could approve the
