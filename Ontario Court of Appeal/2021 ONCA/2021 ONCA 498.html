  <p class=Onappealfrom><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the conviction entered by
    Justice David Harris of the Ontario Court of Justice on January 17, 2020, and
    from the sentence imposed on March 4, 2020, with reasons reported at 2020 ONCJ
    36 and 2020 ONCJ 122.</span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of one count of
    breach of trust of a public official and one count of attempt to obstruct
    justice for using her position as a paralegal prosecutor to improperly
    influence the outcome of provincial offences matters.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police discovered the appellant’s conduct
    after intercepting communications between the appellant and Police Constable
    Richard Senior, who was the primary target in a large investigation into police
    corruption. P.C. Senior and the appellant were having an affair. The
    intercepted communications detailed steps the appellant took to obtain
    favourable outcomes for friends of P.C. Senior’s who were charged with
    provincial offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The intercepted communications were summarized
    in a Substantive Event Summary (“SES”), which was then disclosed to York
    Region, the appellant’s employer. Armed with the SES, the appellant’s
    supervisor gathered court and internal records to provide to the police to use
    in their investigation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant sought to have the intercepted
    communications and York Region records excluded from trial on <em>Charter</em> grounds. Her application was dismissed. She was found guilty of both offences
    for two separate matters and sentenced to a three-month conditional sentence.
    She appeals her conviction and sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant challenges the convictions on three grounds:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%'><span style='line-height:200%'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The verdict was unreasonable. The
    trial judge could not have ruled out the possibility that the appellant was
    lying to impress her intimate friend, and the trial judge was therefore
    required to acquit her.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%'><span style='line-height:200%'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge erred in
    concluding that police disclosure of some aspects of the intercepted
    communications to the appellant’s employer were covered by the exemption in s.
    193(2)(b) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
style='line-height:200%'> as disclosure made in the course of a criminal
    investigation. As a result, the disclosure was illegal, in contravention of s.
    193(1) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Code</span></em><span
style='line-height:200%'>, and tainted the interception evidence on </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span style='line-height:200%'> grounds. Pursuant
    to </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wakeling v. United States of America</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, 2014 SCC 72, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 549<i>, this </i></span><span style='line-height:200%'>evidence should have been excluded.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%'><span style='line-height:200%'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant was convicted of two
    offences for essentially the same conduct and one of the matters should have
    been stayed by operation of the principles in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v.
    Kienapple</span></em><span style='line-height:200%'>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant challenges the sentence, arguing that a conditional
    discharge was the appropriate sentence in the circumstances.</p>
  <h1>Analysis</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept these arguments.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unreasonable verdict</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In brief, the appellant was accused of
    improperly intervening in the prosecution of five traffic offences between May
    and October 2018. The trial judge acquitted the appellant with respect to three
    of these incidents. The appellant’s convictions rest on her involvement in the
    remaining two prosecutions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first concerned Mr. Carlton Wills, who
    received a traffic ticket for disobeying a sign. This charge was ultimately
    withdrawn. The second concerned Mr. Nicholas Guarino, who was charged with
    careless driving. This charge was later reduced to disobeying a lane light.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was nothing improper on the face of these
    dispositions. The assessment of the appellant’s role in these events depends on
    the interpretation of her intercepted communications.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Wills matter</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>P.C. Senior had grown up with Mr. Wills’ son,
    Fabian. They had been friends for 30 years. After he received the ticket, Mr.
    Wills contacted P.C. Senior and asked what he could do about it. On P.C.
    Senior’s instructions, Mr. Wills set a court date for June 1, 2018. Roughly a
    week before the court date, Mr. Wills received a call telling him not to
    attend.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A transcript of proceedings at the Richmond Hill
    Provincial Offences Court, dated June 1, 2018, states that a prosecutor – not
    the appellant – withdrew the charge. Mr. Wills was listed as appearing in
    person.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant is only connected to Mr. Wills’
    matter through the intercepted communications. The appellant, P.C. Senior, and
    Fabian communicated via WhatsApp on June 1, 2018 at around midnight. The key
    portions of their conversation read:<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There later followed a discussion of a Toronto
    traffic ticket. The appellant was not a prosecutor in Toronto:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>CP: Drum roll pls ....</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>CP: Fabian .. pls tell ur dad his seatbelt

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Guarino matter</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Guarino was initially charged with careless
    driving. He spoke with a friend, Roman, who advised Mr. Guarino he would try
    and speak to someone about helping him with the charge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Guarino ultimately attended court and
    pleaded guilty to disobeying a lane light. The fine was substantially lower
    than that for careless driving, and there are no demerit points for disobeying
    a lane light compared to six points for careless driving.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was not the prosecutor at court on
    the day Mr. Guarino appeared, and she never spoke with him. Again, the only
    evidence linking the appellant to the matter is in the following intercepted
    telephone conversation between the appellant and P.C. Senior:</span></p>

    the information in the course of or for the purpose of a criminal
    investigation. The information was disclosed for the subjective, specific

    police hoped to use as evidence against the appellant.</span></p>

    unnecessary for the police to disclose the intercepted communications. They
    could have requested the sought-after ticket information by giving the ticket
    numbers, the names of the persons involved, or the dates of the provincial
    court appearances. Further, the police failed to warn the recipients of their
    request that disclosure was prohibited by the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Counsel
    argues that the temporal connection between the disclosure and the arrest or
    investigation of the appellant is not enough to establish that the disclosure
    of the intercept was “of or for the purpose of [a] criminal investigation.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We agree that it was not logically necessary for
    police to disclose the intercepted communications to obtain the documents they
    sought; however, we are not persuaded that necessity is an element of the
    exemption. The language “in the course of or for the purpose of any criminal
    investigation” is broad and not so limited. Where Parliament meant to require
    necessity as an element in this context it has done so expressly: see, e.g.,
    ss. 184(2)(c) and (e), 184.4(b), 193(2)(d).</span></p>

    This section permits domestic and international sharing of intercepted private
    communications to investigative and prosecutorial authorities. This disclosure
    is potentially quite intrusive, as once the evidence is in a foreign state
    Canadian laws may have no application to its use.</span></p>

    subjective belief of the person making the disclosure is the relevant factor
    for determining whether the exemption is engaged. It is difficult to see how an
    objective test of necessity for the disclosure is compatible with the
    subjective assessment required. Further, in her concurring opinion, McLachlin
    C.J.C. indicated, at para. 92-93, that:</span></p>

    The police were subjectively looking for relevant documents in aid of their
    investigation. In our view, the disclosure was made “in the course of and for
    the purpose of a criminal investigation” and, accordingly, the exemption
    applies.</span></p>

    two different offences that serve different societal interests. One applies
    only to officials. Obstruction of justice requires an intent to obstruct,

    erred in not granting a conditional discharge. She submits that the trial judge
    unreasonably distinguished cases in which a discharge had been granted by
    observing that those involved guilty pleas. Counsel argues that a conditional
    discharge would not have been contrary to the public interest given that the
    appellant was a 37-year-old first offender with no previous record. She has
    suffered serious collateral consequences: the loss of her job and profession.</span></p>

    sentence imposed was not demonstrably unfit, nor was there an error in
    principle. The weight to be given to the mitigation factor of remorse
    demonstrated by a guilty plea in the other cases was a matter for each of the
    sentencing judges in those cases. That mitigating factor was absent here.
    Whether a conditional discharge would have been contrary to the public interest
    was a discretionary decision available to the trial judge: see <em>R. v. Lu</em>,
    2013 ONCA 324, 307 O.A.C. 40, at paras. 48-50, leave to appeal refused, [2013]
    S.C.C.A. No. 313. Given the serious violations of trust placed in the appellant
    as an official, and the potential to erode public confidence in the
    administration of justice, some denunciation was required. There is no basis to
    interfere with the trial judge’s decision that a conditional discharge would
    not be appropriate.</span></p>
