  <p><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Tulloch J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal arises from an arrest and prosecution stemming from Project
    Raphael, a sting operation conducted by the York Regional Police Services between
    2014 and 2017. As part of Project Raphael, undercover police officers posted fictitious
    advertisements for escort services on a website called Backpage.ca. The
    objective was to target buyers interested in purchasing sexual services from minors.
    When persons responded to the ads, an undercover officer posing as the escort
    would disclose in the ensuing text conversation that “she” was underage.
    Individuals who continued the chat and arranged to purchase sexual services
    were directed to a hotel room to complete the transaction. Upon their arrival,
    they were placed under arrest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was one of the individuals who allegedly answered one of
    the Project Raphael advertisements. An individual responded to the
    advertisement and arranged to meet two fourteen-year-olds at a hotel room for
    the purpose of buying sexual services. The text message conversation between
    the officer and the individual confirmed the ages of the “girls” and the fact
    that they were in high school. The appellant arrived at the designated meeting
    spot, and police arrested him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite searching the appellant and his vehicle, police never located
    the phone that sent the text messages in question. Thus, the principal issue at
    trial was whether the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    was the person who arranged by text messaging to meet the underage sex workers.
    The trial judge concluded that the appellant was guilty as charged, and convicted
    him of child luring, arrangement by telecommunication to commit a sexual
    offence against a child, and obtaining sexual services for consideration from a
    person under the age of eighteen, contrary to ss. 172.1, 172.2, and 286.1(2) of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, respectively.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions. He argues that the trial judge
    came to unreasonable conclusions regarding the cell phone evidence that the
    appellant relied on at trial to raise a reasonable doubt. He asks this court to
    consider fresh evidence from a cell phone technology expert, which he submits
    casts doubt on the validity of the trial judge’s findings. The appellant also
    argues that the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <em>R. v. Morrison,</em> 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3 entitles him to a new trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both of the appellant’s grounds
    of appeal against his convictions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant indicated that he sought leave to appeal his
    sentence in his notice of appeal, it appears that this ground has been
    abandoned. As such, it is dismissed as abandoned.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>factual overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above, officers from the York Regional Police Service placed advertisements
    for sexual services on Backpage.ca as part of an undercover police operation
    targeting individuals who purchase sexual services from minors. The
    advertisements included various descriptions, including: “Tight, Brand NEW girl”;
    “18”; “sexy and YOUNG”; and “I also have a YOUNG FRIEND if your interested too.”
    They also included a photograph of a female wearing a t-shirt with a high
    school logo on the front.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective Constable Cook received numerous text messages in response to
    the advertisements, including one that was allegedly sent by the appellant. Officers
    referred to the phone alleged to be associated with the appellant as the “Suspect
    Phone”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between 4:07 p.m. and 8:43 p.m. on March 29, 2017, a person operating the
    Suspect Phone had the following conversation with D.C. Cook, who was undercover
    as “Michelle”:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Suspect Phone [16:07]: Hey Michelle please remove the picture
    with you school name from you ad </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Suspect Phone [16:11]: Can i see you for 1 hr</p>

  <p class=CQuote>Suspect Phone [18:18]: Just trying to watch your back are you
    upset with me.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>D.C. Cook [18:24]: I’m in high school. And some guys like young
    girls so that’s why. I get more guys that way </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Suspect Phone [18:24]: Ok </p>

  <p class=CQuote>D.C. Cook [18:35]: She is busy so I need to know. No pressure.
    She is young like me too. And hot </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Suspect Phone [18:36]: k duo </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>D.C. Cook [18:50]: You want the duo. It’s protected sex and
    bare blow job for $150. That ok </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Suspect Phone [18:51]: Sure and tip </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>D.C. Cook [19:09]: You cool we are young? We are small and look
    Young too and some guys freak because we look too young </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Suspect Phone [19:09]: No worries </p>
  <p class=CQuote>D.C. Cook [19:11]: Ok. We both 14 but turning 15 this year. We
    look a bit older I think. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Suspect Phone [19:09] K </p>
  <p class=CQuote>D.C. Cook [19:16]: Ok my friend is booking me a room soon so I
    have to wait a little bit. She is coming to get me now. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Suspect Phone [19:17]: Ok</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    person messaging from the Suspect Phone was directed by D.C. Cook to a hotel in
    Markham. After sorting out the time and location of the meeting, the following
    discussion ensued:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>D.C. Cook [20:07]: …Can you bring me a hot chocolate please?
    I’ll be good to you. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Suspect Phone [20:08]: Ok what kind </p>
  <p class=CQuote>D.C. Cook [20:09]: Timmies plz </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Suspect Phone [20:33] K I have hot choclete…</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ten
    minutes later, D.C. Cook texted the Suspect Phone that “she” was in room 111,
    to which the Suspect Phone replied, “Ill see you soon.” A few minutes later,
    the appellant arrived at room 111 carrying two hot chocolates in a tray. He was
    placed under arrest. A search incident to arrest revealed that he was carrying
    $300 in cash, keys for a Volvo and Toyota, and some personal effects. He did
    not have his wallet or a cell phone on him. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police found the appellant’s Toyota in the hotel parking lot. Police obtained a
    tele-warrant and searched the vehicle, looking for a cell phone. They located the
    appellant’s identification and $280 in cash in the front console. They also
    found a cell phone in a compartment in the driver’s side door (the “Seized
    Phone”). Detective Constable Salmon testified that the search was complete once
    he found the phone.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    police obtained a warrant to search the Seized Phone, a Computer Forensic
    Examiner concluded that it was not the phone used to communicate with D.C. Cook.
    There was also no information to indicate that the phone was used to look at
    advertisements on Backpage.ca.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Police
    obtained cell phone records from Freedom Mobile regarding the Seized Phone.
    Gord Kent, a Senior Security Specialist in the Lawful Access Department at
    Freedom Mobile, testified regarding those records. He advised that the cell
    phone was registered to the appellant’s wife, Jigna Chheda. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Police
    never found the Suspect Phone. Lorne Ellison of Rogers Communications testified
    that the Suspect Phone was a pay-as-you-go phone operating on the Rogers
    Network. Rogers did not have any identifying registration information
    associated with the Suspect Phone. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown tendered records disclosing the use and location of the Seized Phone and
    the Suspect Phone on the date of the offence. Officer Orshansky testified about
    the various cell tower locations captured in the records to show the connection
    between the locations of the Suspect Phone and the Seized Phone. The locations on
    the day in question were as follows:</p>

  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Decision below</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal issue at trial was whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the person texting D.C. Cook from the Suspect Phone was the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the circumstantial evidence against the accused was
    strong: he showed up to the precise room of the precise hotel at the
    agreed-upon time with the agreed-upon amount of cash and two hot chocolates
    from Tim Hortons. The trial judge also noted that the two cell phones – the Suspect
    Phone and the Seized Phone – connected to the same cell towers around the same
    time in various locations between Niagara and Markham between 4:00 p.m. and
    8:30&nbsp;p.m. on the day of the offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only point of contradictory evidence that the trial judge was required to
    address was a single time in the day when the Suspect Phone and the Seized
    Phone were not traced to the same location. Again, around 7:00 p.m., the Seized
    Phone connected with a tower in Stoney Creek, while the Suspect Phone connected
    with a tower in Etobicoke. The trial judge noted that this was “the only time
    when the two phones appear to be in different locations.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel argued that this dissymmetry in cell phone towers suggested that the
    phones were in separate locations, operated by different individuals. According
    to defence counsel, this was further evidence that the appellant was not the
    individual who sent the messages from the Suspect Phone.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown led two witnesses to explain the data from each of the phones. Both
    witnesses explained that while cell phones typically connect with the nearest
    tower, certain geographic features – and particularly the presence of a large
    body of water – could impact which tower a phone may connect to. The trial
    judge concluded that the one difference in location between the two phones was
    “an anomaly likely explained by the fact of proximity to Lake Ontario along the
    QEW highway.” Otherwise, the phones were generally in similar locations
    throughout the day, and the times and directions of both phones were “highly
    distinctive and inconsistent with the general travel of persons commuting to
    work or attending an event.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    such, the trial judge concluded that “[t]he evidence as a whole reasonably
    points to only one conclusion – Mr. Chheda was the ‘suspect’ person who
    arranged to purchase sex from two young girls.” The one anomalous dissymmetry
    in the cell phone data evidence “was explained and otherwise could not
    reasonably leave a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the appellant’s belief in the age of the person he was meeting, the
    trial judge articulated the law as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[19]    On the two s. 172.1(2) child luring offences alleged in
    counts 1 and 2, the statutory presumption regarding belief in age has been
    struck down – <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Morrison</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>,
    2017&nbsp;</span>ONCA 582 <em><span lang=EN-CA>leave granted </span></em>December
    14, 2017 [2017] SCCA No. 290. In this case the Crown must prove that the
    accused communicated with a person under the age of 16 years for the purpose of
    facilitating an offence under s. 286.1(2) (child prostitution) with respect to
    that person. The accused is required to take reasonable steps to ascertain the
    age of the person – s. 172.1(4). The s.&nbsp;286.1(2) child prostitution
    offence referred to in count&nbsp;2 also contains a reasonable steps
    restriction in s.&nbsp;150.1(5). With respect to counts 4 and 5 there is a
    reasonable steps requirement in s. 172.2.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Ultimately,
    the trial judge found that the evidence showed the appellant “believed the
    girls were 14 and took no further steps in that regard because he was
    unconcerned with their age.” In so doing, he cited the following evidence: (i)
    the appellant sought to purchase sex from the youngest permissible age on the
    website he used; (ii) he was told over text message that he was meeting two fourteen-year-old
    girls in high school and he did not question the statement; (iii) he plainly
    believed he was speaking to a young girl of high school age as one of his
    messages counselled her not to post a photo with her high school logo on her
    t-shirt to protect her privacy; and (iv) he agreed to wait until someone other
    than the girls booked a room, which was an indication that they were minors
    since they were not old enough to book a room themselves. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering
    all the evidence, the trial judge concluded that the Crown had proved all
    charges beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>issues</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal raises two issues. The first issue concerns the trial judge’s treatment
    of the cell phone tower data. On this front, the appellant seeks to adduce
    fresh evidence concerning cell phone tower technology. The second issue
    concerns whether the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Morrison, </em>and
    specifically its effect on the law around mistaken belief in age,<em> </em>entitles
    the appellant to a new trial. </p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>issue one: The Cell phone tower Data</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Positions of the Parties</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant takes issue with the trial judge’s finding that “the Crown has proved
    the tower selection by the Chheda Seized Phone at 1906 is an anomaly likely
    explained by the fact of proximity to Lake Ontario along the QEW highway.” The
    appellant submits that this finding is unsupported by the evidence, and the
    trial judge could not reach this conclusion without speculation. Further, the
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in law by taking judicial notice
    about the operation of cell towers to ground the above-noted conclusion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also seeks to adduce fresh evidence from an expert in cell phone
    technology and the operation of cell phone towers. The expert came to the following
    conclusion about the impugned cell phone tower data:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>It was “virtually impossible” that both phones could
    have been close to the Stoney Creek tower in that time frame;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>It was “virtually impossible” that both phones could
    have been close to the Etobicoke tower in that time frame; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>If both phones had an unobstructed view of Lake
    Ontario, the possibility of them being together is “slightly more plausible”,
    but was still at the level of being “virtually impossible”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that this evidence is clearly relevant to a key issue, the
    expert is credible, and it could have left the trier of fact with a reasonable
    doubt. He further submits that the due diligence requirement should not prevent
    this evidence from being admitted for two reasons: (i) trial counsel could not
    have known that the trial judge would come to a conclusion about cell phone
    data that was not based on the testimony of the phone representatives; and (ii)
    due diligence is not determinative in a criminal case, particularly where the
    quality of fresh evidence is high.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    its part, the respondent argues that the passage the appellant complains of
    discloses no error. First, the respondent submits that the trial judge’s
    conclusion was available to him based on the trial record, not judicial notice.
    Second, the respondent points out that the trial judge’s reasons on this point
    must be read in context: the one anomalous transmission cited by the defence
    could not reasonably leave the trial judge with a doubt based on the totality
    of the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the fresh evidence application, the respondent argues that the
    evidence the appellant seeks to adduce is insufficiently cogent to warrant its
    admission at this stage in the proceedings. The respondent further submits that
    the fresh evidence could have been tendered at trial, but counsel failed to
    exercise due diligence.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the respondent that the trial judge did not err in his treatment of
    the cell phone tower evidence. I would also dismiss the fresh evidence
    application.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge’s finding with respect to the anomaly was grounded in the
    evidence. Two witnesses from cell phone companies testified about the cell tower
    data in this case: Lorne Ellison of Rogers’ Corporate Security Services, and Gord
    Kent, the Senior Security Specialist in the Lawful Access Department at Freedom
    Mobile. The witnesses confirmed that cell phones generally connect to the cell tower
    that is closest in physical proximity, because that tower usually has the strongest
    signal. The witnesses also testified about exceptions to this general rule. For
    example, Ellison noted that: “tall buildings, high hills and large bodies of
    water…may interfere with the line of site going from the phone to the tower in
    which case if there was some type of interference, it would go to the next
    strongest tower.” Similarly, Kent testified that: “There are exceptions to that
    rule like large bodies of water, large physical structures, elevation,
    topography, et cetera.” These comments grounded the trial judge’s conclusion
    that the anomaly was “likely explained by the fact of proximity to Lake Ontario
    along the QEW highway.” It follows that the trial judge did not improperly take
    judicial notice. His conclusion was available based on the evidence that was
    called before him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge considered and rejected defence counsel’s argument that he
    should be left with a reasonable doubt regarding whether the appellant operated
    the Suspect Phone because of the different cell tower data for each phone at
    approximately 7:00 p.m. It was within his discretion, as the trier of fact, to
    decline to draw the inference suggested by the defence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the anomaly in the cell phone tower data was just that – an anomaly. The cell
    phone records otherwise show that the devices had the same pattern of movement
    through several geographic areas that was sustained over the course of several
    hours. Furthermore, when it was clear from the evidence that the phones were
    together – for example, between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. – it is undisputable
    that the Suspect Phone knew the person on the other end was a young high school
    girl.  It was therefore completely reasonable on this record for the trial
    judge to conclude that the irregularity in the data did not raise a reasonable
    doubt when the data was viewed as a whole. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    even with the anomaly in the cell phone records, the trial judge was not left
    with a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s identity based on the strong
    circumstantial case mounted by the Crown. He determined that the Crown had met
    its onus based on the totality of the evidence, including: </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With the exception of the anomaly, the cell
    phone records disclosed “remarkable similarity in location and direction of
    travel for both phones on” the date of the offence – both before and after the
    anomalous transmission. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>b.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The phone records also disclosed prior direct
    communications between the Suspect Phone and the Seized Phone. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Once the Suspect Phone was communicating with
    the undercover officer, there were few messages sent from the Seized Phone. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>d.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Within several minutes of being provided the
    hotel name, the appellant arrived at the hotel. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>e.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Within minutes of the appellant advising that he
    had arrived at the hotel, he appeared outside the door of the specific hotel
    room that D.C. Cook had told the person operating the Suspect Phone to go to. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>f.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was holding two Tim Horton’s hot
    chocolates, as requested by D.C. Cook in his messages to the Suspect Phone. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>g.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant had $300 cash on his person, and D.C.
    Cook had proposed a price of $150 for a half hour “duo” in his texts with the Suspect
    Phone.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    anomaly in the cell tower data did not, and could not, meaningfully detract
    from the strength of the Crown’s case against the appellant. I see no error in
    the manner the trial judge considered this evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
    the fresh evidence application must be dismissed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    it suffers from a lack of due diligence. Although the due diligence requirement
    is not applied as strictly in the criminal context, the cell phone tower data
    was a live issue at trial, and it is not in the interests of finality to
    revisit this evidence. The evidence could have, and should have, been adduced
    at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the fresh evidence cannot reasonably be expected to have affected the result. The
    trial judge specifically turned his mind to the anomaly in the cell phone tower
    data, and ultimately concluded that it would not raise a reasonable doubt. I
    accept his conclusion in this regard. Moreover, the proposed fresh evidence
    does not contradict the limited observation of the cell phone company
    representatives that the trial judge ultimately relied upon: namely, that a
    body of water could disrupt typical patterns of connection between phones and
    cell towers. As well, I agree with the respondent that assessing location based
    on cell phone tower evidence will always be a matter of probabilities, not
    certainties.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similar
    to this case, <em>Morrison</em> arose from an undercover police operation in
    which a police officer, posing as a fourteen-year-old girl named “Mia”,
    responded to an advertisement posted by Mr. Morrison seeking escort services.
    In a conversation that took place over a period of more than two months, Mr.
    Morrison invited “Mia” to touch herself sexually and proposed they meet to
    engage in sexual activity. Mr. Morrison was subsequently charged with child luring
    under s.&nbsp;172.1(1)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code, </em>which is the same
    provision at issue in this case<em>. </em>That section provides:</p>

    respect to that person; or</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notably,
    s. 172.1(3) contains a presumption in the event that a person who the accused
    communicated with represents themselves as being underage (the “Representation
    Presumption”):</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><strong><span lang=EN-CA>172.1 (3)</span></strong><span
lang=EN-CA> Evidence that the person referred to in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or
    (c) was represented to the accused as being under the age of eighteen years,
    sixteen years or fourteen years, as the case may be, is, in the absence of
    evidence to the contrary, proof that the accused believed that the person was
    under that age.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    s. 172.1(4) contains the following limit on the availability of the defence of
    mistaken belief in age (the “Reasonable Steps Requirement”):</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><strong><span lang=EN-CA>172.1(4)</span></strong><span
lang=EN-CA> It is not a defence to a charge under paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c)
    that the accused believed that the person referred to in that paragraph was at
    least eighteen years of age, sixteen years or fourteen years of age, as the
    case may be, unless the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain the age of
    the person.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Mr. Morrison challenged the constitutionality of ss. 172.1(3), (4) and
    172.1(2)(a). Only ss. 172.1 (3) and (4) are relevant for the purpose of this
    appeal as s. 172.1(2)(a) dealt with the mandatory minimum punishment associated
    with the offence under s. 172.1.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the Representation Presumption under s. 172.1(3)
    violated Mr. Morrison’s right to be presumed innocent under s. 11(d) of the <em>Charter, </em>but upheld the Reasonable Steps Requirement under s. 172.1(4) as
    constitutionally sound: see <em>R. v. Morrison, </em>2015 ONCJ 598, 341 C.R.R.
    (2d) 25. Critically, the trial judge took the view that s. 172.1(1)(b)
    contemplated two independent pathways to conviction: the Crown had to establish
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused either: (1) believed the person with
    whom he was communicating was under the age of sixteen or (2) failed to take
    reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the person with whom he was
    communicating. The trial judge convicted Mr. Morrison on the latter pathway,
    that is, he failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain “Mia’s” age, despite
    having a reasonable doubt that Mr. Morrison had a subjective belief that “Mia”
    was underage.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld each of the trial judge’s conclusions on the
    constitutional questions, and dismissed the appeal: see <em>R. v. Morrison, </em>2017
    ONCA 582, 350 C.C.C. (3d) 161. The court acknowledged that the Reasonable Steps
    Requirement added an “objective dimension” to the fault requirement for child
    luring but it was not one of those exceptional offences that requires a purely
    subjective standard of fault: at para. 95.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown sought and was granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Crown
    took issue with the lower courts striking down the Representation Presumption
    under s. 172.1(3), and the mandatory minimum under s. 172.1(2)(a), as unconstitutional.
    Mr. Morrison cross-appealed, submitting that the Reasonable Steps Requirement
    under s. 172.1(4) was unconstitutional since it allowed for a conviction on the
    basis of objective fault. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court heard the appeal on May 24, 2018, approximately two weeks after the
    appellant in this case was tried and convicted of the child luring offences, on
    May 11, 2018. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just
    under a year later, on May 15, 2019, the Supreme Court released its decision in <em>Morrison</em>. The majority allowed the appeal and cross appeal in part.
    The majority concluded that the Representation Presumption under s. 172.1(3)
    violated s. 11(d) and could not be saved by s. 1: paras. 51-73. The majority also
    concluded that the Reasonable Steps Requirement under s. 172.1(4) was
    constitutionally valid: paras. 74-80. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crucially
    however, the Supreme Court parted ways with the lower courts in one key
    respect: its interpretation of the Reasonable Steps Requirement under s.&nbsp;172.1(4).
    Specifically, it held that a failure to take reasonable steps to ascertain a
    person’s age is not an independent pathway to conviction in the absence of the
    Representation Presumption under s. 172.1(3); it merely limits the availability
    of the defence of mistaken belief: para. 80. Instead, there is only one pathway
    to conviction available: the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an
    accused subjectively believed that the person they were communicating with was
    underage in order to attract criminal liability: para. 83. Negligence or
    recklessness with regard to the other person’s age will not suffice: para. 83. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court further clarified that if the Crown proves beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the accused did not take reasonable steps, then the trier of fact is
    precluded from considering the defence that the accused believed the other
    person to be of legal age: para. 83.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    that in mind, I return to the issues at hand.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Positions of the Parties</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that he is entitled to a new trial because <em>Morrison </em>changed
    the legal landscape concerning the <em>mens rea </em>that a Crown must prove to
    ground a child luring conviction under s. 172.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The
    appellant submits that there was ample reason to doubt the appellant’s
    subjective belief in the “girls’” age. Moreover, he argues that the trial
    judge’s conclusion may not stand absent the consideration that the appellant
    did not take reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the “girls” he was
    meeting.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent argues that the trial judge did not follow the line of reasoning
    prohibited by <em>Morrison</em>: namely, to jump from a lack of reasonable
    steps to a conclusion that the Crown had met its onus to prove that the
    appellant believed D.C. Cook was under sixteen. Instead, according to the
    respondent, the trial judge concluded that the Crown proved beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the appellant believed the “girls” were underage; a finding that is
    sufficient to ground a conviction [notwithstanding] in accordance with the
    Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Morrison. </em></p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted above, the trial judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court’s
    decision in <em>Morrison</em>, as it was released nearly a year after the
    appellant’s guilty verdict. But despite the shift in the court’s interpretation
    of the child luring provisions, the verdict in this case nonetheless remains on
    steady ground. I see no material legal error committed by the trial judge in
    convicting the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    concluding that the appellant was indeed the individual messaging D.C. Cook
    from the Suspect Phone, the trial judge referred to the following evidence to
    support his conclusion that the appellant <em>believed </em>the person from whom
    he was arranging to purchase sexual services was fourteen:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    “sought to purchase sex from a person with the youngest possible age permitted
    on the website he used”; </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    “was told the person he was making arrangements with and her friend were 14
    years of age and he didn’t question that statement”; </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>c.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    “plainly believed that he was speaking to a young girl of high school age as he
    counselled her not to post a photo with her high school logo on the t-shirt to
    protect her privacy”; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>d.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    “agreed to wait until another person booked a room for the girls, another
    indication that they were underage as they could not book their own room.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then went on to conclude that: “The evidence shows Mr.&nbsp;Chheda
    believed the girls were 14 and took no further steps in that regard because he
    was unconcerned with their age.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it is clear that the trial judge concluded beyond a reasonable doubt on
    the facts presented that the appellant subjectively believed that the “girls”
    were underage. The above-noted evidence, viewed in its totality, supports a
    finding of subjective belief, not mere recklessness or negligence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reference to the appellant not taking reasonable steps comes at the very end of
    this analysis and presents as a peripheral consideration, and not a fundamental
    factor in making the determination. This makes sense: whether the appellant
    took reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the person with whom he was
    communicating was not a live issue at trial. The appellant argued that the
    trial judge should be left with a reasonable doubt that he was the person
    operating the Suspect Phone. He did not additionally argue that he lacked the
    requisite belief that the person he was interacting with was under sixteen.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the respondent that the trial judge’s reasons for judgment in this
    case do not support a conclusion that he reasoned backwards from the lack of
    any evidence of reasonable steps by the appellant to conclude that the Crown
    had met its onus. When viewed as a whole, the record is clear: the trial judge followed
    the only permissible pathway to conviction – proof beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the accused believed the other person was underage. As such, the trial
    judge’s finding of guilt complies with the present state of the law in the wake
    of the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Morrison</em>. As such, I would decline
    to interfere with the trial judge’s decision on that basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h1>G.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conclusion and disposition</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appellant’s appeal of his conviction. I would also dismiss
    his sentence appeal as abandoned.</p>
