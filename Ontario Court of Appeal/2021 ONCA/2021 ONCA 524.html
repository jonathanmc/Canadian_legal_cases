    FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Abdulle appeals from a disposition of the
    Ontario Review Board dated December 8, 2020, maintaining a detention order but
    permitting a transfer Mr. Adbulle requested to the Royal Ottawa Mental Health
    Centre.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the Board erred in
    failing to grant him an absolute discharge. He indicates that, if granted an
    absolute discharge, he will continue to take the long-acting medication which
    has been prescribed for him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Amicus</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> advances
    three arguments. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Board erred in giving any weight to reasons
    for decision of this court on a previous appeal stating that a previous Board
    panel’s finding on the same issue “were both logical and reasonable on the
    record before it.”</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Board erred in giving any weight to the
    perceived vigour with which the appellant’s counsel argued for an absolute
    discharge.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He submits that the conclusion that the appellant
    constituted a significant threat to public safety was unreasonable. The Board
    did not engage in a robust analysis of the factors favoring the appellant and
    its reasons are conclusory.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s detention relates to two sets of
    index offences. The first set occurred on April 8, 2008, when the appellant
    attended at the residence of his brother and sister-in-law, threatened to kill
    his brother, and kicked the front door off its hinges. On November 25, 2008,
    the appellant was found not criminally responsible on account of mental
    disorder (“NCR”) on charges of uttering threats to cause death or bodily harm,
    mischief, and failing to comply with an undertaking.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 7, 2011, while the appellant was in
    the community after leaving Montfort Hospital, he committed the second set of
    index offences. The appellant, wielding a screwdriver, acted aggressively and
    chased a stranger. Later, armed with a rock, the appellant continued to chase the
    stranger, this time threatening to kill him. Also, before police brought him
    into custody, the appellant exposed himself to three women. On October 21,
    2011, the appellant was found NCR on charges of assault with a weapon, uttering
    threats to cause death or bodily harm, committing an indecent act, and failing
    to comply with a recognizance: see <em>Abdulle (Re)</em>, 2020 ONCA 698.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s criminal record</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant has a criminal record including
    convictions from 2003 to 2012. It includes convictions for assault, assaulting
    a police officer, possession of weapons (including a firearm), robbery, drug
    possession and trafficking. Two convictions – drug trafficking and assault – were
    entered while the appellant was living in the community, subject to the jurisdiction
    of the Board. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s psychiatric history</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was first admitted to a
    psychiatric hospital in 1997, when he was eighteen, for a stay of a month’s
    duration. Between 2000 and 2006, he was hospitalized on multiple occasions but consistently
    failed to take medication prescribed for him when released. He has a
    significant history of daily alcohol and drug abuse since he was fifteen years
    old.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>His current diagnoses are the following:</span></p>

    period</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant has not made any significant
    progress in the last reporting period. The hospital report indicates that he
    has had repeated relapses, characterized by hypomania, lability of mood,
    bizarre behaviour and disinhibition. Part of the reason for the standstill was
    the appellant’s refusal to stop using cannabis, and his refusal to take mood
    stabilizing medication because he fears the side effects associated with it. He
    also refuses to be considered for community housing in the Brockville area and
    refuses to discuss community discharge planning, stating repeatedly that he
    will continue to appeal until he gets an absolute discharge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The hospital report before the Board, authored
    by Dr. Sanjiv Gulati, concluded that the appellant remained a significant threat
    to the safety of the public:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Given Mr. Abdulle's long history of mental
    illness, history of violence, ongoing periods of instability, indulgence in
    substance misuse and cyclical relapses, he remains a significant threat to the
    safety of the public at the present time. In my opinion, if Mr. Abdulle was to
    be out in the community and was going through a cyclical relapse such as been
    evidenced on the unit, he would pose a threat to the safety of the public
    through his bizarre, disinhibited and erratic behaviour. His behaviour during
    times of relapse can significantly be perceived as threatening towards others
    around him and it is only through the expertise and skill set of staff, he has
    been redirected and no aggressive/violent incidents have occurred. It is also
    to be noted that his behaviour goes over and above mere annoyance and can cause
    significant distress in people around him who are not familiar with his illness
    as they can perceive his gestures to be threatening.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It remains the opinion of the team that if Mr.
    Abdulle was in the community on a conditional/absolute discharge without
    adequate supervision, he will constitute a significant threat to the safety of
    the public. His current disposition is the least restrictive, least onerous,
    necessary and most appropriate way of managing risk.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The team is not opposed to Mr. Abdulle being
    discharged from the hospital on a detention order. A discharge on such an order
    would allow the team to adequately monitor him, screen for illicit substance
    misuse, timely intervene and put actions into place to mitigate any risks that
    he poses towards self and others. The team continues to look for supervised
    accommodation and has also made some suggestions to him such as the FITT House
    or consider other placements in the community, but Mr. Abdulle remains
    reluctant to accept any of these. Therefore, it appears that we are at an
    impasse but it does not necessarily equate to a therapeutic impasse where
    transfer to another team may resolve the impasse.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is the insight
    on Mr. Abdulle's part that needs to be worked on and we will continue to
    endeavor to work on this in the coming year in the hope that he will engage and
    be willing to abstain from illicit substances and comply with a mood stabilizer
    thus achieve a period of stability, prior to being granted an absolute
    discharge.</span></p>

    trial of community living in approved accommodation before he could recommend
    an absolute discharge. A previous discharge in 2017 into highly structured,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Board considered the arguments made on
    behalf of the appellant at para. 38 of its reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Davies
    submitted that Mr. Abdulle no longer meets the significant risk threshold. He
    pointed to the fact that the index offences occurred in 2008 and 2011, and that
    there had been a significant period of time with no evidence of convictions. He
    submitted that there is no empirical evidence that Mr. Abdulle’s continued
    cannabis use contributes to his periodic relapses, and he emphasized that there
    have been no physically violent incidents during the periods when Mr. Abdulle
    has been hospitalized. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Board’s reasons for concluding that the
    appellant remained a significant threat are contained at paras. 41-44 of its
    reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There can be no doubt on the evidence before
    us that Mr. Abdulle remains a significant threat to public safety. The
    uncontradicted evidence is that the risk factors for Mr. Abdulle remain the
    same as at last year’s annual hearing. At last year’s hearing, the Board heard
    evidence that Mr. Abdulle was making encouraging progress and that his relapses
    had become less frequent. At this year’s hearing, the evidence was that no
    progress had been made, and that the Hospital and Mr. Abdulle had reached an
    impasse, albeit it was not acknowledged that the impasse was a “treatment
    impasse.”</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Yet, based on the evidence before the Board at
    last year’s hearing, and the Board’s explanation for its conclusion, the Court
    of Appeal stated at para. 15 of its decision, released on November 4, 2020,
    that the Board’s findings that Mr. Abdulle remained a significant threat “were
    both logical and reasonable on the record before it”.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Given the less encouraging evidence at this
    year’s hearing, it is understandable that Mr. Davies did not vigorously press
    for an Absolute Discharge.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Based on the
    evidence, the Board had no hesitation in concluding that Mr. Abdulle continues
    to pose a significant threat to the safety of the public. The evidence
    persuades us that without Board oversight, Mr. Abdulle would stop taking his
    prescribed medications. We are persuaded that within a short time, he would
    relapse, thereby leading to his engaging in criminal conduct that would put
    members of the public at significant risk of psychological or physical, harm.</span></p>

    of counsel’s submissions is an unmeasurable quality. He submits that, in some
    contexts, such observations are not helpful as they may impair the relationship
    between counsel and client. Moreover, the Board cannot default to positions
    taken by the parties. It is an inquisitorial body that is obliged to search out
    evidence when necessary and come to its own conclusions: see<em> Winko v.

    the notion that their advocacy would have an impact on a judge’s reasoning
    process. A judge will almost invariably have thoughts about counsels’ advocacy
    although those thoughts will not often be expressed. Sometimes arguments made
    by the most eloquent and able lawyers are not accepted by a court. At other
    times, less able lawyers find their arguments win the day, despite deficiencies
    in their own performance. As <em>amicus</em> suggests, clients do not always
    understand this. For example, the best advocates do not yell at the court by
    making all their arguments uniformly loud; in some circumstances,
    understatement is more persuasive and helpful to the client. In any event, the
    outcome of a proceeding should not be taken as an endorsement or repudiation of
    a lawyer’s approach in a particular case. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A significant
    threat to the safety of the public means a real risk of physical or
    psychological harm to members of the public that is serious in the sense of

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my opinion, if
    Mr. Abdulle was to be out in the community and was going through a cyclical
    relapse such as been evidenced on the unit, he would pose a threat to the

    His behaviour during times of relapse can significantly be perceived as
    threatening towards others around him and it is only through the expertise and
    skill set of staff, he has been redirected and no aggressive/violent incidents
    have occurred. It is also to be noted that his behaviour goes over and above
    mere annoyance and can cause significant distress in people around him who are
    not familiar with his illness as they can perceive his gestures to be
    threatening.</span></p>

    it was persuaded that without Board oversight Mr. Abdulle would stop taking his
