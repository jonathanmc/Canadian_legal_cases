  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, D.L., was convicted of a number
    of serious offences involving a violent sexual assault on an intimate partner.
    Those convictions include sexual assault, assault, mischief, extortion,
    unlawful confinement, criminal harassment and breach of probation. He plead
    guilty to possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. He received a
    global sentence of six years minus credit for presentence custody.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He has appealed the convictions and sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In October 2020, the appellant sought and was
    granted bail pending appeal. The bail judge characterized the decision to grant
    bail as a “close call”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On February 1, 2021, the appellant was charged
    with uttering a death threat. His bail pending appeal expired on February 13,
    2021 and he again sought bail pending appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On February 19, 2021, the application was denied
    for two reasons. First, the appellant was charged with uttering a threat: When
    he went to his father’s premises upon his death to collect certain property, he
    became angry and said to his stepmother “If you call the police, I will kill
    you in three seconds”. Without acknowledging the veracity of this account,
    counsel submitted before Benotto J.A. that the appellant was upset about his
    father's death. Benotto J.A. did not accept this excuse and suggested that,
    “these allegations raise concerns about public safety and public confidence in
    the justice system”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, Benotto J.A. noted that the transcripts
    of the trial were now available. While the merits passed the “not frivolous”
    standard, Benotto J.A. suggested that the strength of the appeal was not as
    strong as the first bail judge assumed and together these factors
    “significantly tip the scales to enforceability. This is no longer a close
    call.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 2, 2021, the charges for uttering a
    death threat were withdrawn after the appellant entered into a common law peace
    bond and in any event, he notes that the charge was brought when his father had
    just passed away and that there was no evidence of any actual violence. He
    applies again for bail pending appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown opposes the appellant’s application
    for bail pending appeal on the basis that the applicant has not demonstrated
    that there is a material change in circumstances to justify revisiting the
    February 19, 2021 order denying him bail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown also submits that the appellant has
    not demonstrated that his continued detention is not necessary in the public
    interest. The Crown submits that the weak ground of appeal, risk to public
    safety, seriousness of the offences, and lengthy sentence are such that his
    continued detention is necessary in the public interest under s. 679(3)(c) of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is common ground that to obtain bail pending
    appeal pursuant to s.&nbsp;679(3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, the applicant
    must establish that: (1) the appeal is not frivolous (s. 679(3)(a)); (2) he
    will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order
    (s. 679(3)(b)); and (3) his detention is not necessary in the public interest
    (s. 679(3)(c)). In a s. 679 application, the applicant bears the burden of
    establishing each of the three itemized release considerations, on the balance
    of probabilities, before an interim judicial release order may be made: <em>R.&nbsp;v.
    Oland</em>, 2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 250, at para. 19.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>EVIDENCE REGARDING THE OFFENCES AT ISSUE</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The convictions being appealed from, pertain to
    the appellant's former girlfriend. At the time, both had entered new
    relationships.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is not disputed that within a period of two
    days, the appellant sent 68 emails to the complainant before she agreed to meet
    him. The trial judge held that this was “not just annoying … it is
    threatening”. The emails refer to things he would do to collect the money she
    owed him, threatening to get the money from her new boyfriend as well as her
    family. The trial judge found the emails constituted criminal harassment. After
    receiving these emails, the complainant agreed to meet him and picked him up in
    her car.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Their account of what happened thereafter was
    significantly different.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claims the complainant yelled at
    him because he had changed the pickup location, they argued and then drove to a
    parking lot where they kissed. After about 20 minutes they left, he asked her
    if she was going to leave the man she was seeing, and she asked whether he
    would leave his girlfriend.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant agreed that she was angry with
    the appellant for changing the pickup location. She said that when she arrived,
    he tried to convince her to go inside and told her to message the man she was
    seeing to break off the relationship. When she refused, he took her car keys
    and she followed him inside. She claims she saw a person from behind she
    believed to be the homeowner, whom she knew. Thereafter she claims the
    appellant gave her an ultimatum: to message the man she was seeing or take her
    clothes off. She took her clothes off. Once she undressed, the appellant took
    his clothes off and forced her to perform fellatio. He then told her to lie on
    the bed and had intercourse with her and, after ejaculating on her stomach,
    turned her over and continued to have intercourse. She said that thereafter,
    they both showered, and she said she would message her former boyfriend. She
    says the appellant slammed the door shut and raised his fist as though to punch
    her and she started to cry. He then let her leave and she drove him to the
    place where she usually picked him up.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An appellant who has been denied bail pending
    appeal must demonstrate a material change in circumstances on a new
    application. A material change in circumstances requires “additional
    information that could lead the judge hearing the application to alter the
    assessment of one or more of the statutory factors set out in section 679(3)”: <em>R.
    v. Baltovich</em> (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 761 (Ont. C.A.), at para.&nbsp;6. If
    there has been a material change, the judge must consider the statutory grounds
    and be satisfied that the applicant meets the onus in s. 679(3).</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The first issue: Is there a material change
    in circumstances?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the appellant appeared before Benotto J.A.,
    he was charged with uttering a threat while in the presence of his surety. She
    held that, taken together, this fact, the public safety concerns, and the
    finding that strength of the case had weakened since the findings of the first
    bail judge (as transcripts of the trial were now available), led her to
    conclude that this was no longer a “close call” and that the appellant should
    be denied bail pending appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The question is whether there is a material
    change in circumstances that could alter the assessment that the appellant
    should be detained pending appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The charge of uttering a threat has now been
    withdrawn and the appellant has entered into a common law peace bond. A peace
    bond is not an admission of guilt but is a preventative order which intended to
    keep the peace. There must be some basis for the bond: <em>R. v. Musoni</em> (2009), 243 C.C.C. (3d) 17 (Ont. S.C.), at para. 40, aff’d 2009 ONCA 829, 248
    C.C.C. (3d) 487, at paras. 3-4, leave to appeal refused, [2009] S.C.C.A. No.
    534.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, no reasons were offered by the
    appellant for withdrawal of the charges. I note that before Benotto J.A.,
    “without acknowledging the veracity of the Crown’s account, counsel submits
    that he was upset about his father’s death”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Taken together:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the appellant’s criminal past with multiple
    convictions for violent offences and many breaches of court orders;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>these serious convictions;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the appellant’s agreement to enter a peace bond
    upon withdrawal of the charge of uttering a threat without providing any
    explanation as to why he elected to do so; and,</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the enhanced strength of the case after review
    of the transcripts of the evidence at trial,</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>satisfy me that the change in
    circumstances does not represent a material change such that the decision as to
    whether to grant bail should be revisited. This is especially so given that the
    first bail judge determined that the granting of bail was a “close call” before
    the trial transcripts were made available.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The second issue: Is there a public safety
    concern that warrants continued detention?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In any event, I find the public interest
    concerns justify the appellant’s continued detention.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The “public interest” criterion under s.
    679(3)(c) considers the protection and safety of the public: (i) an individual
    must pose a “substantial likelihood” of committing an offence or interfering
    with the administration of justice; (ii) the “substantial likelihood” must
    endanger the “protection or safety of the public”; and (iii) the individual’s
    detention must be “necessary” for public safety: <em>R. v. Morales</em>, [1992]
    3 S.C.R. 711, at p. 737; <em>R. v. Stojanovski</em>, 2020 ONCA 285, at para.
    18.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Public confidence ought to be considered when
    the offences are serious: <em>Oland</em>, at paras. 29-30. The question of
    public confidence must be assessed from the perspective of an informed member
    of the public who understands our bail system, and the facts of the case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The public confidence component involves
    weighing enforceability, or the need to respect the general rule of the
    immediate enforceability of all judgments, and reviewability, which concerns
    the need to provide for a meaningful review process, such that the process does
    not require persons convicted of offences to serve all or a significant part of
    their sentence only to have their conviction overturned on appeal: <em>Oland</em>,
    at paras. 24-26.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The more serious the crimes, the greater the
    risk that public confidence in the administration of justice will be undermined
    if the person convicted is released on bail pending appeal: <em>Oland</em>, at
    para. 37. The absence of flight or public safety risks will attenuate the
    enforceability interest. Other factors should also be considered where appropriate: <em>Oland</em>, at para. 39.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of a serious sexual
    assault, forcible confinement and assault in the context of a domestic
    relationship. At that time, he was on probation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He was also convicted of criminal harassment and
    pled guilty to trafficking cocaine. These convictions are not affected by his
    argument on appeal that the trial judge erred in assessing credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the six-year sentence underscores the
    seriousness of the offences: <em>R. v. S.M.</em>, 2020 ONCA 427, at para 13.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the appellant’s threats to the
    complainant engage public safety concerns weighing in favour of enforceability
    against release: <em>Stojanovski</em>, at paras. 24-27.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lastly, in respect of the trial judge’s
    credibility assessment, while it is possible that the court could accept the
    homeowner’s evidence that he did not believe the appellant ever brought the
    complainant to his house, it could also accept the complainant’s evidence that
    she was assaulted there. I note that the homeowner said that he did not know what
    happened when he was not at home.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>CONCLUSION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, I find the change in the
    strength of the appellant’s case is not material and that in any event, the
    public interest favours his continued detention pending the hearing of his appeal.
    The application for bail pending appeal is therefore denied.</span></p>
