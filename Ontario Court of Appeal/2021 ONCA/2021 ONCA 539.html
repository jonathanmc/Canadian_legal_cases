  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Neil Harris was shot and killed at his Hamilton
    barbershop at around 4:18&nbsp;p.m. on February 18, 2016. Two men wearing
    hoodies were seen entering the barbershop shortly before the shooting and
    fleeing the scene immediately after. Surveillance video confirmed that, in all,
    the duration of the incident from the time the two men entered the barbershop
    until they left was between 15 to 18 seconds.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Harris was killed by a single bullet that
    passed through his right arm, entered the right side of his chest, and then
    exited the left side, causing fatal injuries to his heart, aorta, lungs, and
    pulmonary artery.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and Erick Reid were arrested and tried
    together for the first degree murder of Mr. Harris. Following a multi-day
    trial, the jury found the appellant guilty of first degree murder and Mr. Reid
    not guilty of first degree murder, but guilty of manslaughter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Two witnesses at trial identified the appellant
    as the shooter and gave evidence implicating Mr. Reid as his accomplice. One of
    these witnesses, Devon Edwards, was sitting on a couch in the barbershop at the
    time of the shooting. He knew Mr. Reid and was acquainted with the appellant.
    He claimed that, upon entering the barbershop, Mr. Reid put a gun to his side and
    told him not to move while the appellant approached, and then shot, Mr. Harris.
    The second witness, Justin Dumpfrey, claimed to have heard both the appellant
    and Mr. Reid make inculpatory statements following the shooting; to have seen
    the appellant with a gun soon after the shooting; and to have observed Mr. Reid
    give a third man, Tyrone Abrahams, some clothing, including the hoodie it was
    later established Mr.&nbsp;Reid was wearing at the time of the shooting. Both Mr.
    Edwards and Mr.&nbsp;Dumpfrey had criminal records. Neither identified the
    appellant or Mr. Reid as being involved in the shooting until being charged
    with unrelated criminal offences. Moreover, after being arrested as a suspect
    within hours of the shooting, Mr.&nbsp;Edwards told police he could not identify
    the perpetrators.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In late February 2016, police recovered the
    hoodie Mr. Reid was wearing at the time of the shooting from the home of Sarah
    Bernard, Mr. Abrahams’ then-girlfriend. Mr. Reid’s <a name="_Hlk76678698">DNA
    was found on the collar</a>, and fibres from the hoodie were indistinguishable
    from fibres found on the undershirt Mr. Harris was wearing when he was shot. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Reid testified at trial and admitted he
    accompanied the shooter to the barbershop. He claimed the shooter offered to
    connect him with a marijuana supplier and that he went to the barbershop solely
    to buy weed and possibly get a haircut. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to Mr. Reid, the shooter entered the
    barbershop first and approached Mr. Harris while he (Mr. Reid) stayed at the
    door. He recognized Mr.&nbsp;Edwards, who he knew, and nodded to him. As the
    shooter approached Mr.&nbsp;Harris, Mr. Reid heard something drop and then a
    shot. Mr. Harris ran and bumped into Mr. Reid as he went out the door. Mr. Reid
    ran away with the shooter. Although Mr. Reid knew who the shooter was, he would
    not identify him at trial because he feared for his life and the safety of his
    family. However, he acknowledged that he got a call from the shooter just
    before meeting him and going to the barbershop. Mr. Reid did not dispute that
    was the last telephone call he received before the shooting. He declined to say
    who he was talking to during that call, but cell phone records revealed that
    the last telephone call to his cell phone before the shooting (as opposed to
    the last text message) was from a cell phone the appellant had been known to
    use. However, Mr. Reid denied the Crown’s suggestions that he went to the
    barbershop with the appellant to assist the appellant in carrying out the
    execution of Mr. Harris.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant did not testify at trial. His
    position at trial focused on identity. He claimed he was not one of the two men
    who entered the barbershop. A statement he gave to the police about three weeks
    after the killing in which he denied any involvement was introduced as evidence
    at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>No physical evidence tied the appellant to the
    killing. However, cell phone records showed Mr. Reid’s phone and one of several
    cell phones the appellant was known to use were in communication shortly before
    the shooting and on several days thereafter. Both cell phones had gaps in usage
    around the time of the shooting. As noted above, the last telephone call to Mr.
    Reid’s cell phone before the shooting came from a cell phone the appellant had
    been known to use. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By the end of the trial, neither the Crown nor
    the appellant was taking the position Mr. Reid was the shooter. In his closing
    address, Crown counsel asserted that Mr. Reid’s liability for first degree
    murder arose from the fact that he aided the appellant in committing a planned
    and deliberate murder. In the alternative, the Crown asserted Mr. Reid agreed
    to participate in a robbery with the appellant, knowing the appellant was armed
    with a gun and knowing that murder was a probable consequence of their common
    unlawful purpose, thus making him guilty of second degree murder.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his charge to the jury, the trial judge instructed
    the jury on first degree murder, second degree murder, manslaughter and party
    liability. Under the heading “Parties”, he explained that, in addition to
    actually committing an offence, a person can be guilty of an offence under the
    aiding (s. 21(1)(b)) or common purpose (s. 21(2)) provisions of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When dealing with the substantive offences and
    the liability of the principal, <em>i.e.</em>, the shooter, the trial judge
    appeared to leave it open to the jury to consider whether either the appellant
    or Mr. Reid was the shooter. However, when addressing “Parties” (and in the
    decision trees and verdict sheet), he clarified that Mr. Reid’s potential
    liability arose only under the aiding or common purpose provisions of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge reviewed the bulk of the trial
    evidence (the evidence of 23 of the 27 witnesses) when dealing with causation,
    the first of the four elements of the standard charge for first degree murder
    (causation; unlawful act; intent for murder; planning and deliberation).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant raises two issues on his
    conviction appeal:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>i.)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the trial judge erred in failing to properly
    relate the material evidence to the issues to be determined by the jury; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>ii.)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the trial judge gave an erroneous after-the-fact
    conduct instruction. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Witnesses at Trial</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In total, 27 witnesses testified at trial: 25
    for the Crown; Mr. Reid on his own behalf; and Ms. Bernard on behalf of the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her closing address to the jury, trial
    counsel for the appellant (not appellate counsel) divided the trial witnesses
    into five categories. I will follow trial counsel’s approach but provide additional
    detail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The category one witnesses comprised what trial
    counsel referred to as the helpful, truthful, and innocent witnesses. These
    were: Tanya Harris, the deceased’s widow; Gregory Richards, a friend and former
    co-worker of the deceased who testified to Mr. Harris’ limited marijuana sales
    to his inner circle; and five neighbourhood witnesses.<a href="#_ftn1"

    southerly direction, the larger of the two men (later acknowledged to be Mr.
    Reid) pumping his arms as he fled, the smaller man appearing to be concealing
    something under his clothing; and </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>subsequently, two other men, later identified as
    Mr. Edwards and Jevais Dunkley, emerging from the barbershop and heading north.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>None of the five neighbourhood witnesses who saw
    the two men wearing hoodies enter or exit the barbershop or flee the scene
    could identify them. Nor could the surveillance video.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel for the appellant described the category
    two witnesses as the “lying manipulative witnesses who [were] only there to
    help themselves.” The first of the category two witnesses was Mr. Edwards; the
    second was Mr. Dumpfrey.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Edwards testified he was sitting on a couch
    in the barbershop playing a game on his phone when the two men entered. He knew
    Mr. Reid and had met the appellant a few times. He claimed Mr. Reid approached
    him, put a gun to his side and told him not to move and to keep his head down.
    Meanwhile, the appellant approached Mr. Harris. Although Mr. Edwards had his
    head down, he was able to see that the appellant had a gun. Nothing was said; Mr.
    Harris batted at the appellant’s hand and ran for the door. He was shot as he
    did so. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Edwards was confronted at trial about many
    inconsistencies and potential frailties in his evidence. Although he was
    arrested as a possible suspect within hours of the shooting, he told police at

    identify the assailants. While asserting that his conscience bothered him over
    the next five months, Mr. Edwards did not tell the police what he claimed he
    knew until July 2016. This occurred only after he was arrested and charged with
    multiple offences relating to automobile thefts. Following the preliminary
    inquiry in relation to these offences, he was allowed to plead guilty to a
    fraction of the charges. He was sentenced to one day in jail, based on a joint
    submission that took into account the one night Mr. Edwards spent in jail
    following his arrest and his cooperation in this matter. </span></p>

    had heard talk on the street that the appellant was the shooter. He also

    evidence concerning whether the two men put on masks, where they were when he
    was able to see their faces, and what the person who approached him was
    wearing. Nonetheless, he maintained all versions of his statements and evidence

    appellant as the shooter and Mr. Reid as the shooter’s accomplice. Mr. Dumpfrey
    had a lengthy criminal record. He made an initial statement implicating the
    appellant and Mr. Reid only after being arrested for unrelated offences in May
    2016. </span></p>

    inculpatory statements by the appellant and Mr. Reid at a Hamilton
    house/hangout known as “the office” shortly after the shooting. He claimed he
    was waiting for Mr. Reid at the office to buy some weed. Mr. Abrahams arrived
    about half an hour after he arrived. About five minutes later, the appellant
    and Mr. Reid arrived. Mr. Abrahams told them they had “fucked up” and they were
    “hot”. Mr. Abrahams, the appellant, and Mr. Reid went into an adjacent room. The
    appellant suggested Mr. Abrahams had given him a broken gun. Mr. Abraham took
    the gun from the appellant, unjammed it, and told the appellant it was jammed,
    not broken. The appellant and Mr. Reid had a heated discussion. Among other
    things, Mr. Reid told the appellant it was supposed to be a robbery, and no one
    was to get killed. The appellant responded that Mr. Reid was supposed to watch
    the door; he wasn’t supposed to let “the guy” run out of the barbershop. Mr.
    Reid answered his job was to rob everyone who was sitting in the barbershop. Mr.
    Dumpfrey also said he saw Mr. Reid give Mr. Abrahams the clothing he (Mr. Reid)
    was wearing at the time of the shooting. Police later recovered Mr. Reid’s
    hoodie during a search of Ms. Bernard’s home.</span></p>

    appellant made inculpatory statements while the two shared a jail cell in July
    2016. Among other things, he said the appellant blamed Mr. Reid for causing the
    shooting because Mr. Reid failed to block the barbershop doorway. Further, he
    claimed that, at the appellant’s request, he invited Mr. Abrahams, who was also
    then incarcerated, to their cell. According to Mr. Dumpfrey, the appellant and
    Mr. Abrahams had a lengthy and heated conversation about what Mr. Abrahams may
    have told Ms. Bernard and, at one point, the appellant pulled out a shank and
    threatened to stab Mr. Abrahams. </span></p>

    offence and also if he does anything for the purpose of helping another person
    to commit it. The trial judge confirmed that the Crown’s position was that the
    appellant was a principal to the first degree murder of Mr. Harris, that is,
    the appellant was the shooter, and further, that Mr. Reid aided the appellant
    in that first degree murder. The trial judge also confirmed it was the position
    of the defence that neither accused had the required mental state to commit
    first or second degree murder and that neither was involved in the shooting of
    Mr. Harris. Following his discussion of aiding, the trial judge discussed
    common purpose liability under s. 21(2) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.</span></p>

    to a trial judge’s duty to assist a jury by relating the material evidence to
    the factual issues to be determined to reach a true verdict. First, the trial
    judge must distill the evidence to what is material to the issues that are
    still in play at the end of the trial. Second, the trial judge must relate the
    relevant parts of the material evidence to the particular issues to which the
    evidence relates. </span></p>

    issues for the two accused were distinctly different. The fundamental issue for
    the appellant was identity – was he the shooter who caused Mr. Harris’ death? If
    the appellant was found to be the shooter, the additional issues were whether
    he possessed a murderous intent and whether the killing was planned and
    deliberate. </span></p>

    the shooter, the issues were whether he acted as a party under either s.
    21(1)(b) or s. 21(2) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> and, if he did, whether he
    was a party to a planned and deliberate murder.</span></p>

    single review of the evidence for both accused and by incorporating evidence by

    one issue. However, the appellant submits that, in this case, the trial judge
    erred in two ways. </span></p>

    he contends that the trial judge made further errors in his review of the
    evidence for elements two (unlawful act), three (intent for murder), and four
    (planning and deliberation). I will discuss the appellant’s position regarding
    each element in turn. Before doing so, I will review the general principles

    C.C.C. (3d) 508, at paras. 11 to 13, Laskin J.A. summarized the necessary
    components of a trial judge’s instructions to the jury in a criminal jury
    trial. He also explained that trial judges have a broad discretion in
    structuring a jury charge; that the standard of review on appeal is adequacy,
    not perfection; and that appellate courts must adopt a functional approach in
    reviewing jury instructions that assesses the adequacy of the instructions

  <p class=CQuote>In brief, trial judges have a broad discretion in how to charge
    a jury. Their decision about how much evidence to review, what structure to use
    and how to organize the charge falls within that discretion. <span
class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>But, ideally, the charge should contain some

    presumption of innocence, the burden of proof, how to assess the credibility

  <p class=CQuote>A charge containing these five components best enables the jury
    to appreciate “the value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be
    applied to the facts as <em><span lang=EN-CA>they</span></em> find them”
    (emphasis in original). See<em><span lang=EN-CA> Azoulay&nbsp;v.&nbsp;The Queen</span></em>,

  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, the standard
    of review is adequacy, not perfection. An appellate court’s approach is
    “functional”. It assesses the adequacy of the charge in the light of its purpose</span></span>.
    Even if a trial judge strays from the ideal, the fundamental question an
    appellate court must ask is: <span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>has the
    jury been “left with a sufficient understanding of the facts as they relate to
    the relevant issues”</span></span>. See <em><span lang=EN-CA>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Jacquard, </span></em>[1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 14. Or, <span class=Underline><span

lang=EN-CA>R. v. Cooper</span></em>, [1993] 1&nbsp;S.C.R. 146, at p. 163. If
    the answer to either question is “yes”, then the charge will be upheld on
    appeal, despite any imperfections. If the answer is “no”, then the accused will
    have been denied a fair trial and any convictions must be set aside. [Emphasis

    judge overcomplicated his instructions by proceeding in this fashion.
    Nonetheless, on the facts of this case, the issues relating to whether the

    Mr. Dumpfrey, claimed to have seen the appellant and Mr. Reid arrive at “the
    office” shortly after the shooting, to have seen the appellant with a gun, and
    to have heard both the appellant and Mr. Reid make inculpatory statements at
    that location. He also claimed to have heard the appellant make additional

    received at approximately 4:06 p.m. on February 18, 2016 – was from the

    which the witnesses testified at trial. However, contrary to the appellant’s
    submissions, in my view, the trial judge organized the evidence in an
    intelligible manner, which would have allowed the jury to appreciate what
    issues each witness’ evidence pertained to: the medical cause of death; whether
    the appellant was the shooter and the reliability and credibility of the
    witnesses who claimed that he was; Mr. Reid’s participation in the shooting and
    how his evidence reflected on the reliability and credibility of the
    identification witnesses; and the impact of the cell phone evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fact that the medical cause of death was not
    a contentious issue by the end of the trial does not mean the trial judge erred
    in reviewing the pathologist’s evidence under element one. Cause of death was
    not conceded. Moreover, the pathologist’s evidence about lack of stippling
    demonstrated that the shooter and the barber were at least one metre apart,
    potentially supporting Mr. Edward’s evidence that Mr. Harris tried to run away.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence of the scene witnesses who could
    not identify the assailants, including Mr. Dunkley, nonetheless provided
    context for the jury to evaluate the reliability and credibility of Mr.
    Edwards’ evidence. Some, including Mr. Dunkley, testified about whether they
    saw masks. Some testified about what they heard or saw Mr. Edwards say or do as
    he exited the barbershop. This provided not only a backdrop from which the jury
    could evaluate Mr. Edwards’ evidence, but also evidence relevant to specific
    aspects of his evidence. Moreover, the very fact that these witnesses could not
    identify the assailants was relevant to the question whether identity had been
    proven.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The two post-shooting witnesses whose evidence
    the trial judge reviewed in addition to Mr. Dumpfrey’s (Sergeant Murphy and Mr.
    Veith), provided context for the jury to evaluate the reliability and
    credibility of the identification witnesses. The review of Sergeant Murphy’s
    evidence related primarily to the police contact with Mr. Edwards and what, if
    any, information or help they gave him. The review of Mr.&nbsp;Veith’s evidence
    cast suspicion on Mr. Dumpfrey’s evidence concerning the appellant’s
    interaction with Mr. Abrahams while in jail. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> I agree that most of the witnesses’ evidence
    that the trial judge reviewed under the heading “Forensic Evidence” pertained
    to identifying Mr. Reid, a matter not in issue by the end of the trial.
    However, that that evidence pertained solely to identifying Mr. Reid as a possible
    shooter would have been obvious to the jury. I fail to see how it could have
    confused them when, at least in this segment of his charge, the trial judge was
    treating Mr. Reid as a possible shooter. Sergeant&nbsp;O’Keefe’s evidence, also
    reviewed under the “Forensic Evidence” heading, once again provided the jury
    with context in which to evaluate the reliability and credibility of both Mr.
    Edward’s and Mr. Dumpfrey’s evidence. Sergeant O’Keefe provided photographs of
    the scene and gave evidence about finding a cartridge case and probable bullet
    strike mark at the scene. This evidence was relevant to Mr. Edwards’ evidence
    concerning how events unfolded (thus his credibility) and to Mr. Dumpfrey’s
    evidence about the gun jamming. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant does not contest the propriety of
    the trial judge reviewing the evidence of the cell phone witnesses, save for
    Sergeant Tselepakis, who extracted a photograph of Mr. Reid wearing a
    particular garment from a cell phone. Once again, I am confident the jury would
    have easily understood that this evidence related to the identification of Mr.
    Reid, and that it did not prejudice the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As for the evidence the trial judge reviewed
    under the headings “Evidence Solely Admissible for or Against Erick Reid” and
    “Statements Made by Erick Reid to Justin Dumpfrey”, this evidence related to
    statements Mr. Reid allegedly made to Mr. Dumpfrey two days after the shooting,
    when Mr. Dumpfrey again met Mr.&nbsp;Reid to buy weed. The alleged statements
    included assertions that the appellant “fucked up” Mr. Reid’s life, that the
    shooting was not supposed to happen, and that Mr. Reid felt the murder was a
    hit based on someone paying the appellant to do it. Undoubtedly, the trial
    judge reviewed this evidence because, in this section of the charge, he treated
    Mr. Reid as a potential principal to the offence of first degree murder. Once
    again, I acknowledge that it would have been preferable had the trial judge not
    done so. However, I reiterate that given the manner in which the trial judge
    structured his charge, I am confident the jury would have understood this
    evidence related solely to Mr. Reid’s participation and, equally important,
    that this evidence was not admissible against the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As for the defence evidence reviewed under
    element one, in addition to treating Mr. Reid as a potential principal in this
    section of the charge, I conclude it was open to the trial judge to review Mr.
    Reid’s evidence to provide a context for the jury to assess the reliability and
    credibility of Mr. Edward’s and Mr. Dumpfrey’s evidence, specifically as it
    related to the shooting and events immediately preceding and following it. Ms.
    Bernard’s evidence went primarily to the identification of Mr. Reid. However,
    she was also cross-examined by the Crown and gave evidence relevant to the cell
    phone number used by the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Reviewing the charge as a whole, I am satisfied
    that the jury would have understood that the issues relating to the appellant’s
    identity as the shooter centred on the credibility of Mr. Edwards and Mr.
    Dumpfrey and an assessment of the cell phone evidence. I am also satisfied that
    the jury would have understood that they were required to determine those
    issues, not by examining that evidence in isolation, but by examining it in the
    context of the evidence of other witnesses who gave evidence relevant to it. I
    am not satisfied the jury would have been confused by the evidence relating to
    the identification of Mr. Reid. The trial judge charged the jury as if Mr. Reid
    was a potential principal to the offence of first degree murder, <em>i.e.</em>,
    the shooter. It would have been obvious to the jury that evidence relevant to
    his identity pertained to that issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, this case is distinguishable from
    this court’s decisions in both <em>Barreira</em> and <em>Newton</em>, on which
    the appellant relies. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Unlike this case, in <em>Barreira</em>, the
    shooter admitted through counsel that he was the person who shot the deceased.
    He took the position that he had done so instinctively as a reaction to the
    deceased punching him. The remaining defendants admitted through counsel to
    being present at the shooting, but denied they were parties to it. In <em>Barreira</em>,
    the trial judge reviewed the evidence of <span class=Underline>all</span> the
    witnesses at trial in the order in which they testified under element one of
    first degree murder (causation). However, in <em>Barreira </em>neither
    causation nor identity were in issue. Concerning intent for murder and planning
    and deliberation – the two live issues at the trial for the shooter – this
    court plainly found the trial judge’s evidentiary review inadequate. In
    relation to intent for murder, the trial judge told the jury only to consider
    the evidence already summarized and “then made brief reference to the issue of
    intoxication and one reference to a piece of post-offence conduct”: at para.
    34. After setting out the evidence the trial judge reviewed under element four,
    planning and deliberation, this court said, at para. 35: “None of this had any
    potential to assist the jury in terms of the issues they had to decide.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Newton</em>, again the shooter admitted
    his identity, but asserted the murder was not planned and deliberate and also
    claimed he lacked the intent for murder, as he had just been shooting randomly.
    This court noted that the trial judge reviewed the evidence of most of the
    witnesses who testified but did so by reading her notes of their evidence,
    roughly in the order each witness gave evidence. This court stated, at para.
    20, in part:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The issues were numerous and some were
    difficult. [The shooter’s] main defence was that he did not plan and deliberate
    on the killing so he should not be found guilty of first degree murder. <span
class=Underline>A considerable amount of evidence was relevant to the issue of
    planning and deliberation</span>. <span class=Underline>The jury needed help to
    assess this evidence. Unfortunately, the trial judge did not help it to do so.</span> [<span class=Underline>The shooter’s] secondary position</span> was that he
    lacked the <em>mens rea</em> or mental state for murder – <span
class=Underline>he was just stupidly firing bullets to scare [one of the
    victims]. Again the trial judge did not discuss the evidence bearing on that
    issue</span>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the trial judge conducted the bulk
    of his evidentiary review in relation to the main issue for the shooter, <em>i.e.</em>,
    his identity. Again, I agree that it would have been preferable had the trial
    judge not referred to Mr. Reid as a potential principal to first degree murder
    and not reviewed the evidence relating to Mr. Reid’s identification under
    element one, or under the remaining elements of first degree murder. That said,
    there was no objection to the trial judge’s approach in that respect, and
    having reviewed the charge as a whole, I am satisfied that the jury would have
    understood the issues relating to the shooter’s identity and the evidence they
    had to consider in determining those issues. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The instructions concerning element one were not
    perfect. By instructing the jury as if Mr. Reid were a potential shooter and
    then taking that option away, the trial judge made his instructions to the jury
    more complicated than was necessary. However, taking a functional approach to
    these instructions, I conclude they were adequate in the circumstances of this
    case, where the issues concerning whether the appellant or Mr. Reid was the
    shooter and the evidence relevant to those issues were obvious. Adequacy is the
    standard to be met.</span></p>

    irrelevant to the question whether the homicide was unlawful. Although the

    review consisted of only three paragraphs and focused on the pathologist’s
    evidence of the gunshot wound Mr. Harris suffered. The trial judge’s remaining
    instructions to consider the circumstances of each accused, the nature of the
    act alleged, anything said around the time of the incident, the surveillance

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    element three, intent for murder, after setting out the standard instructions,
    the trial judge instructed the jury to consider, with respect to both the
    appellant and Mr. Reid, the evidence he had already summarized under elements one
    and two (other than the after-the-fact conduct evidence) and nine other listed
    items, including Mr. Reid’s evidence that his only purpose in going to the
    barbershop was to buy weed and possibly get a haircut. The appellant contends
    that the trial judge committed reversible error by proceeding in this way.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a starting point, the appellant argues that much of the evidence summarized
    under element one was irrelevant to the shooter’s intent. More importantly,
    since no one took the position Mr. Reid was the shooter, the issue concerning
    his intention had to be dealt with when addressing party liability. The
    requisite intent for a party under ss. 21(1)(b) or 21(2) and a principal is different.
    Accordingly, it was an error to identify Mr. Reid’s intention as an issue in this
    section of the charge and review evidence relevant to his intention. The
    appellant submits this was not a harmless error vis-à-vis him because evidence
    relevant to Mr. Reid’s intent was not material to the intent of the shooter. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge’s erroneous approach to reviewing the evidence relevant to

    the trial judge used the phrase “and/or” 23 times when discussing this element.
    Use of this language was improper and could only have increased the potential
    for the jury to use irrelevant evidence to assess the shooter’s intention: <em>R.

    this created a risk the jury would have relied on evidence irrelevant to his

    possible shooter. By the time the jury reached element three of first degree
    murder, they would have determined that the appellant was the shooter and it
    would have been obvious to them that evidence relating to Mr. Reid’s intent was
    not relevant to that issue. As this court explained in <em>Josipovic</em>, at
    para. 44, and/or language is not in and of itself improper. Jury instructions

    the shooter had a gun or that he would use it to shoot Mr. Harris.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Concerning the appellant, the trial judge also
    instructed the jury to consider Mr. Dumpfrey’s evidence that, while the two
    were in jail, the appellant told Mr.&nbsp;Dumpfrey that he blamed Mr. Reid for
    the shooting and said the shooting would not have been necessary had Mr. Reid
    done his job.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I acknowledge that much of the evidence reviewed
    under elements one and two and the forensic evidence identifying Mr. Reid would
    not have been relevant to the shooter’s intent and that the surveillance
    evidence would have had marginal, if any, relevance to that issue. However, the
    remaining items specifically reviewed by the trial judge, as well as the
    pathologist’s evidence, Mr. Dumpfrey’s evidence about the jammed gun, and the
    exhibit officer’s evidence relating to the scene of the crime, would have been
    very relevant to that issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given the specific items of evidence that the
    trial judge did review, I see little likelihood that the jury would have been
    in any way confused about the evidence that was relevant to this issue. In
    other words, given that the trial judge specifically reviewed evidence relevant
    to determining the issue of intent, I am not convinced the jury would have been
    confused by an instruction to bear in mind the whole of the evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, I observe that on the facts of this
    case, the question of the shooter’s intent was barely, if at all, a live issue.
    Mr. Harris was shot in the chest at relatively close range. While not conceding
    intent, appellant’s counsel did not raise any issues in her closing suggesting
    how the jury might find a reasonable doubt concerning at least the secondary
    intent for murder.</span></p>

    concepts of planning and deliberation, the trial judge instructed the jury to
    consider the evidence he had summarized under elements one to three (other than
    the after-the-fact conduct), the short time frame during which Mr. Reid and the
    shooter were in the barbershop, and eight of the nine items he had listed under
    element three. Once again, the appellant submits that the instruction to
    consider the evidence summarized under element one was an error because much of
    that evidence was irrelevant to planning and deliberation. Moreover, use of the
    and/or language under this element improperly suggested either that Mr. Reid
    and the shooter had both committed a planned and deliberate murder, or that at
    least one of them had done so.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s specific objection to the trial
    judge’s use of and/or language under this heading is that the 15 times the
    trial judge used such language in this section of the charge may have misled
    the jury into thinking either both (the “and” of the phrase) or at least one of
    them (the “or” of the phrase) committed a planned and deliberate murder. In
    other words, the jury may have understood they were required to find at least
    one of the accused committed a planned and deliberate murder.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the trial judge’s opening statement to
    the jury under this heading reads:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Was the particular accused, Odain Gardner

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>Nothing about this question suggests at least one of the named
    accused must have committed a planned and deliberate murder. In any event, the
    trial judge closed his instructions on this issue with the following
    statements:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>If you are not satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder of Neil Harris was both planned and
    deliberate, you must find the particular accused, Odain Gardner and/or Erick

    guilty of second degree murder.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, the first of these statements made it clear that the
    central question was whether the murder was planned and deliberate. If it was
    not, the jury was required to find whichever person they were considering not
    guilty of first degree murder. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In his factum, the appellant submitted that two aspects of the trial
    judge’s after-the-fact conduct instruction amounted to reversible error: i) the
    “Flight from the Scene” instruction; and ii) the “Lies to the Police”
    instruction. In oral argument, the appellant abandoned his argument about the lies
    to the police instruction. However, he maintained his position that, vis-à-vis
    him, the trial judge erred in his after-the-fact conduct instruction concerning
    flight from the police.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As part of his after-the-fact conduct instructions, the trial judge
    told the jury they could find that “any, all or some of the accused’s flight
    from the scene” was circumstantial evidence that an accused “was a participant
    to the unlawful act of shooting Neil Harris”. The appellant acknowledges that
    this instruction was correct concerning Mr. Reid: his flight from the scene was
    some evidence that he was not an innocent dupe but rather a knowing participant
    in the shooting. However, the appellant submits that the instruction was not
    correct vis-à-vis him. Only if the jury found that the appellant was the
    shooter could they then find that he fled from the police because he was
    conscious of being a participant in the shooting – and only then could they
    consider his flight as circumstantial evidence that he was the shooter. Since
    the jury had to find the appellant was the shooter before it could use his
    flight as circumstantial evidence that he was the shooter, vis-à-vis him, the
    instruction was wrong. Such circular or tautological reasoning is improper: see <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Hall</em>, 2010 ONCA 724, 263 C.C.C. (3d) 5, at paras.
    141-43, leave to appeal refused, [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 499. </span></p>

    may consider this evidence together with all of the other evidence in reaching
    your verdict. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This court’s concern in <em>Hall</em> was that the jury was invited
    to jump directly to the issue of guilt as a precondition to deciding the use
    they would make of the after-the-fact conduct. Nonetheless, in <em>Hall</em>,
    this court found that this flaw in the instructions, standing alone, did not
    constitute reversible error.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In this case, the trial judge did not use the impugned language from <em>Hall</em>. Instead, prior to giving the instruction with which the
    appellant takes issue, the trial judge told the jury that before they used the
    after-the-fact conduct evidence for any purpose, they first had to decide if
    the appellant (or Mr. Reid) had engaged in the conduct alleged:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>You may find it helpful to approach this
    evidence of what the accused are alleged to have said or done afterwards in two
    steps.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The first step requires you to decide whether
    any of the accused actually did or said what he is alleged to have said or done
    after the offence was committed. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If you find that a particular accused did not
    do or say what he is alleged to have done or said after the offence was

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>These instructions would have made it clear to the jury that to
    consider the appellant’s flight from the scene as after-the-fact conduct, they
    first had to conclude that he was one of the men seen fleeing in a southerly
    direction immediately after the shooting. The subsequent instruction that, if
    they were so satisfied, they could use the after-the-fact conduct evidence to
    find the appellant was a participant in the shooting, may have been both unnecessary
    and circular, but it did not prejudice the appellant. In any event, as <em>Hall</em> makes clear, such an instruction, standing alone, does not constitute
    reversible error.</span></p>
