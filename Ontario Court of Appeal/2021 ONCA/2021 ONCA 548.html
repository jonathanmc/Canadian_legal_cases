  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicants are some of the defendants in this action. They move for
    a stay of the order of Gilmore J. which determined that Ontario has jurisdiction
    over an action involving an alleged fraud by former high-ranking government
    officers in Saudi Arabia. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several orders in the court below set out the extensive history. I
    summarize only that which frames this motion. </p>
  <p class=Heading>FACTS IN BRIEF</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background to the action</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The plaintiffs are a group of ten companies
    established between 2007 and 2015. They operate in strategic industries, such
    as aerospace and cybersecurity. They also fund covert operations for
    counterterrorism operations in Saudi Arabia and operate legitimate businesses
    to provide plausible public cover for these activities.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The plaintiffs allege that billions of dollars
    have been brazenly stolen through a fraudulent scheme masterminded by a former
    Saudi cabinet minister, the defendant Saad Khalid Al Jabri (“Al Jabri”). The
    other defendants allegedly participated in or benefitted from the scheme to
    defraud the plaintiffs. Al Jabri was the Director of the Department of Officers
    and Personnel Affairs and Security Advisor to the Ministry of Interior of Saudi
    Arabia. He is highly educated and worked for decades as a senior civil servant
    in the security and intelligence agencies of Saudi Arabia. He served as a
    Minister of State and as a Special Advisor to Muhammed Bin Nayef (“MBN”), the
    former Crown Prince and Minister of the Interior. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2015, on King Abdullah’s death, King Salman
    acceded to the throne and MBN was named Minister of the Interior. King Salman’s
    son, Mohammed Bin Salman (“MBS”), was appointed Minister of Defence. In April
    2015, MBN was named Crown Prince and MBS was named Deputy Crown Prince. MBN was
    later deposed in a coup. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>In September 2015, Al Jabri was removed
    from office at the insistence of MBS. The reason for the removal is in dispute.
    The plaintiffs say he was removed because of his fraudulent activity. Al Jabri
    submits that it was because he met with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
    Director and did not report that meeting to MBS. In any event, an investigation
    into Al Jabri was conducted and he eventually moved to Canada. He lives in
    Toronto with his wife and family members. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The allegations of fraud</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The plaintiffs allege that Al Jabri organized a
    fraudulent scheme to misappropriate $3.5B USD from the plaintiffs. He did so,
    it is alleged, using nominees to hide his control and beneficial ownership of
    significant assets. He installed family members, including his son, Mohammed Al
    Jabri (“Mohammed”), as nominee shareholders. He then made significant transfers
    to the nominees. The misappropriated funds were used to acquire assets around
    the world. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The plaintiffs say they have already traced
    nearly half a billion US dollars through this scheme. There is also a “gift
    deed” that Al Jabri made to Mohammed whereby Al Jabri purportedly gifted
    Mohammed all of his worldwide assets. Mohammed used these assets, in part, to
    benefit family members including through the purchase of a $13 million home in
    Toronto for Al Jabri.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The </span><i><span lang=EN-CA>Mareva</span></i><span
lang=EN-CA> Injunction</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Gilmore J. has had carriage of all the steps in
    the litigation. In January 2021, she issued an <em>Mareva </em>injunction over
    all of Al Jabri’s worldwide assets, restraining him from dissipating his
    assets. In February 2021, the plaintiffs learned of the gift to Mohammed and
    returned to Gilmore J. to seek to vary the order to secure the gifted assets. Gilmore
    J. adjourned the motion so that Mohammed and other corporate defendants could
    move to challenge the jurisdiction of the Ontario courts. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Jurisdiction Decision</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jurisdiction motion was heard on May 19,
    2021, with reasons released on June 22, 2021. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge held that to assert
    jurisdiction over a foreign defendant, a “good arguable case” must be
    established on the record before her. She concluded on five separate grounds
    that Ontario had jurisdiction. In particular:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A presumptive connecting factor arose from
    numerous contracts made in Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The deed of gift from Al Jabri to Mohammed was
    written and signed in Ontario. She also concluded that the gift was a ruse and that
    Al Jabri continues to direct the management of the assets acquired through a
    fraudulent scheme, even though Mohammed may be the legal or beneficial owner of
    the assets.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There were assets in Ontario acquired with funds
    re-gifted by Mohammed to Al Jabri.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Acts in furtherance of the alleged tort of
    conspiracy occurred in Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is a real and substantial connection
    between the subject matter of the claim and Ontario which had not been rebutted
    by the defendants who had not raised <i>forum non conveniens.</i></span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further scheduled motion</span></h2>

    Jabri’s evidence on the gift was contradictory. The gift deed was finally written
    in Ontario in late 2018. Transfers in accordance with the gift did not happen

    620</span><span lang=EN>, 283 O.A.C. 321, Laskin J.A. considered a request for
    a stay of a jurisdiction order pending an application for leave to appeal to
    the Supreme Court of Canada. The responding party undertook not to argue that
    delivery of a defence or participation in examinations for discovery
    constituted acts of attornment. Referring to </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>M.J.
    Jones</span></em><span lang=EN>, Laskin J.A. stated, at paras. 29-31:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[<a name=par29>29</a>]&nbsp;…Without commenting
    on the correctness of that decision, I simply observe that the present case is
    distinguishable. In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>M.J. Jones</span></em><span
lang=EN>, Lang J.A. dealt with whether a court order requiring a defendant to
    deliver a statement of defence would amount to attornment. She held that a
    court order requiring a defendant to participate in an action, even though
    involuntarily, might amount to attornment. Therefore, she held that despite the
    plaintiff’s undertaking not to treat the defendant’s participation as
    attornment, refusing a stay could cause irreparable harm. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[<a name=par30>30</a>]&nbsp;Here, no court order
    or involuntary participation is required because [the plaintiff] asks [the
    defendant] only for a statement of defence to permit it to move ahead with
    discoveries. Furthermore, Lang J.A. appears to have contemplated and approved
    of this very scenario. She wrote at para. 52:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>This disposition does not necessarily preclude
    all parties to this action cooperating by exchanging documents and answering
    questions about the merits of the disputes between them. Such exchange, if done
    outside the formal bounds of these court proceedings, would, in my view, not be
    considered an attornment to Ontario’s jurisdiction. It would simply be an
    efficient exchange of information that, with the agreement of the parties,
    could later be used either in the Ontario proceeding, or in any subsequent
    Michigan proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[<a name=par31>31</a>]&nbsp;As [the documents are
    requested] outside of the “formal bounds” of the court proceedings, I do not
    consider that the delivery of a statement of defence or participation in
    discoveries, would amount to attornment. If there is no attornment, the risk of
    [the defendant’s] appeal becoming moot is eliminated. [The defendant]
    therefore, has not made out irreparable harm.</span></p>

    constitute attornment:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Attornment by participation in court proceedings

    attornment, they will suffer irreparable harm. MacPherson J.A. said, at para.
    11: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>I do not accept this

    Moreover, and importantly, the responding parties have explicitly stated in
    their factum (para. 28) that if the moving parties simply provide them with
    their statements of defence (without formally filing them), “the respondents
    are content to receive the same, without prejudice to the Chevron companies
    Leave to Appeal Applications and will not claim that by doing so they have

lang=EN>Second, </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Van Damme</span></em><span lang=EN> was a decision by a panel of this court. As MacPherson J.A. pointed out: (i)
    compliance with the order, including related conduct of depositions and

lang=EN style='font-style:normal'> </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA>voluntary</span></em><span
lang=EN> step indicating submission to the jurisdiction. Attornment cannot
    arise is circumstances of duress: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wolfe v. Wyeth</span></em><span
lang=EN>, 2011 ONCA 347, 332 D.L.R. (4th) 157, at para. 44. The plaintiffs
    submit that a response to a worldwide </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Mareva</span></em><span
lang=EN> injunction should not be considered a voluntary step indicating
    submission to the jurisdiction. Rather they say it is an example of duress. The
    plaintiffs analogize the situation here to that in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Schwarzinger
    v. Bramwell</span></em><span lang=EN>, 2011 BCSC 283 where the British Columbia
    court held that the defendants were under duress when they applied to vary a worldwide </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Mareva</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span><span
lang=EN>injunction. Although their assets were not in the custody of the court,
    the effect of the order was to prohibit them from dealing with assets and conducting
    their day-to-day business operations. Consequently, there was no consent-based
    jurisdiction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>I agree with the plaintiffs that a response to the worldwide </span><em><span

    to engage in an issue, unlike in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wolfe,</span></em><span
lang=EN> where the defendants sought to dismiss or stay the action for issue
    estoppel. Here, there is also the undertaking of the plaintiffs not to assert
