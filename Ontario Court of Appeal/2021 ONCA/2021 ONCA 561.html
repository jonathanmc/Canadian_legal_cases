    application for a stay of his convictions for trafficking heroin to an
    undercover police officer on three different occasions in the course of
    “dial-a-dope” operations, and for the possession of the proceeds of crime from
    trafficking. The appellant maintains that the trial judge erred in failing to
    find that he was entrapped by the police into committing the offences that
    formed the basis for his convictions.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 26, 2017, following a re-election
    to a trial before a judge alone and pursuant to an agreed statement of fact,
    the appellant pled guilty to four counts of an eight-count indictment. The four
    remaining counts were withdrawn at the Crown’s request. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The basic factual underpinnings for the convictions
    were founded on the following agreed statement of fact:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On May 9, 2015, the [Toronto Drug Squad] entered
    into a drug investigation. A now retired officer Tony Canepa negotiated the
    purchase of a gram of heroin with an individual referred to as “Prince” for
    $200. Tony Canepa attended the area as directed and met “Prince”, who was later
    identified as Mr. Henry-Osborne. Tony Canepa gave Mr. Henry-Osbourne $200 in
    marked police buy money and in return received a quantity of heroin, later
    determined to weigh 1.08 grams.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On May 11, 2015 Tony Canepa called “Prince”
    again and entered into another drug related conversation. “Prince” agreed to
    sell a gram of heroin for $200 directing the officer to meet him in the area of
    Jane Street and Sheppard Avenue, Toronto. Tony Canepa attended the area as
    directed and met Mr. Henry-Osbourne. Tony Canepa gave Mr. Henry-Osborne $200 in
    marked police buy money and in return received a quantity of heroin, later
    determined to weigh 1.06 grams.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On July 11, 2015
    Tony Canepa called “Prince” again and entered into another drug related
    conversation with “Prince”. “Prince” agreed to sell 6.5 grams of heroin for
    $1000 directing the officer to meet him in the area of Jane Street and Sheppard
    Avenue, Toronto. Tony Canepa attended the area as directed and met Mr.
    Henry-Osbourne. Tony Canepa gave Mr. Henry-Osborne $1000 in marked police buy
    money and in return received a quantity of heroin, later determined to weigh
    6.5 grams. Mr. Henry-Osbourne was subsequently arrested. The $1000 of police
    buy money and a telephone was found on him during a search incident to arrest.
    The police confirmed the phone in his possession was assigned to phone number
    416.302.4105 that the police had used to contact “Prince” previously.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found the appellant guilty on
    three counts of trafficking heroin and one count of possession of the proceeds
    of crime from trafficking. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8><span lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Application for a stay of the convictions</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 26 and 27, 2017 the appellant
    brought an application before the trial judge to stay his convictions on the
    ground that he was entrapped into the criminal conduct underlying the guilty
    pleas. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence on the application consisted of the
    agreed statement of fact and the <em>viva voce</em> evidence of the undercover
    officer, Tony Canepa, who had retired by the time of the application. Officer
    Canepa testified about the information that he had received prior to calling
    the appellant, and the conversations and text exchanges that he had with the
    appellant and others in the course of the heroin purchases. I examine those
    conversations and texts in further detail later in these reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge applied the following test for
    entrapment under <em>R. v. Mack</em>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 959, which she
    identified as the governing jurisprudence at that time: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There is,
    therefore, entrapment when: (a) the authorities provide an opportunity to
    persons to commit an offence without reasonable suspicion or acting <em>mala
    fides</em> … or, (b) having a reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry, they go beyond providing an opportunity and induce
    the commission of an offence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge concluded that there was no
    evidence of the undercover officer offering an inducement and that the conduct
    of the investigation did not constitute random virtue testing because it was
    “focused on one individual possessing several articulated physical
    characteristics and three specific patterns of conduct: the use of the style
    ‘Prince’, the use of a specific telephone number, and dealing in heroin”. She
    also found that there was no evidence that the undercover police officer was
    not acting <em>bona fide</em> in investigating the tip that led to the
    telephone calls. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge made no specific finding as to
    whether Officer Canepa had a reasonable suspicion to believe the appellant was
    involved in drug trafficking before presenting him with an opportunity to
    commit a crime because she determined that the reasonable suspicion standard
    articulated under the first branch of the <em>Mack</em> test was inapplicable
    in a dial-a-dope context involving the <em>bona fide</em> investigation of a
    tip. The trial judge reasoned as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In the context </span><span
lang=EN-CA>of </span><span lang=EN-CA>dial-a-dope </span><span lang=EN-CA>operations,
    many </span><span lang=EN-CA>undercover investigations will start </span><span
lang=EN-CA>with a tip </span><span lang=EN-CA>only, </span><span lang=EN-CA>and </span><span lang=EN-CA>for </span><span lang=EN-CA>that reason, </span><span
lang=EN-CA>it will not </span><span lang=EN-CA>be possible to </span><span
lang=EN-CA>say that </span><span lang=EN-CA>the </span><span lang=EN-CA>police
    start out with a </span><span lang=EN-CA>“reasonable </span><span lang=EN-CA>suspicion</span><span
lang=EN-CA>”. The police nevertheless </span><span lang=EN-CA>have </span><span
lang=EN-CA>a </span><span lang=EN-CA>duty to </span><span lang=EN-CA>investigate, </span><span lang=EN-CA>and in the dial-a-dope context,</span><span lang=EN-CA> </span><span lang=EN-CA>investi</span><span lang=EN-CA>g</span><span
lang=EN-CA>ation requires </span><span lang=EN-CA>a </span><span lang=EN-CA>call </span><span lang=EN-CA>to </span><span lang=EN-CA>the target </span><span
lang=EN-CA>number </span><span lang=EN-CA>to de</span><span lang=EN-CA>te</span><span
lang=EN-CA>rmine </span><span lang=EN-CA>whether </span><span lang=EN-CA>the
    tip can be </span><span lang=EN-CA>confirmed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s reasoning on this point was
    tied to her holding that an “opportunity to offend” existed as soon as police
    placed a call using drug-coded language to the targeted phone number. She interpreted <em>Mack</em> to mean that: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>an opportunity to
    offend [i.e. a drug-coded phone call] may properly be extended to the target of
    a <em>bona fide</em> investigation if it is in the course of and for the
    purposes of the investigation whether the information in the possession of the
    police at the time of the offer rises to the level of a reasonable suspicion or
    is only at a level of a “mere” suspicion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On that basis, the trial judge found that the
    appellant had not been entrapped by the police and dismissed the appellant’s
    stay application. On February 9, 2018, the appellant received a global sentence
    of 3 years, 2 months and 27 days, which he does not seek to appeal separately
    from the convictions.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s principal submission is that the
    trial judge erred in applying the wrong test for entrapment. Specifically, the
    appellant submits that the</span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> t</span><span
style='line-height:200%'>rial judge erred in law by applying a </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>bona fide</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>investigation test rather than the reasonable
    suspicion test required under the Supreme Court’s most recent articulation of
    the test for entrapment in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Ahmad</span></em><span
style='line-height:200%'>. The appellant maintains that, like in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Williams</span></em><span style='line-height:200%'>, the
    companion case to </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Ahmad</span></em><span
style='line-height:200%'>, the brief conversations and texts between the appellant
    and the undercover officer did not afford a sufficient basis to ground a
    reasonable suspicion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown submits that while the trial judge did not have the
    benefit of the Supreme Court’s guidance in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Ahmad</span></em>,
    the trial judge’s jurisprudential instinct and factual findings were nevertheless
    correct. According to the Crown, the circumstances of the present case are
    almost identical to those in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Ahmad</span></em>. Applying <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Ahmad</span></em> to the circumstances of the present case, the Crown
    argues, still leads to the trial judge’s conclusion that there was no
    entrapment.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As this court very recently acknowledged in <em>R.
    v. Ramelson</em>, 2021 ONCA 328, appeal as of right filed [2021] S.C.C.A No.
    137, at para. 34, <em>Ahmad </em>did not fundamentally change the law of
    entrapment as it stood under <em>Mack</em> and <em>R. v. Barnes</em>, [1991] 1
    S.C.R. 449. See also: <em>R. v. Ghotra</em>, 2020 ONCA 373, at paras. 16 to 19.
    However, the majority in <em>Ahmad</em> provided important clarifications on how
    to apply the law of entrapment in the context of “dial-a-dope” operations,
    particularly with respect to the assessment of reasonable suspicion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    may provide an opportunity to commit a crime only upon forming a reasonable
    suspicion that the person answering the phone is engaged in drug trafficking: <em>Ahmad</em>,
    at para. 44. The majority in <em>Ahmad</em> was careful to emphasize at para.
    20 that a<em> bona fide </em>investigation is not a separate and freestanding
    way to entrap an individual. Rather, an investigation is <em>bona fide</em> where the police have reached a threshold of reasonable suspicion and they have
    a genuine purpose of investigating crime. Ultimately, the entrapment analysis focuses
    on whether the police had formed a reasonable suspicion when they created an
    opportunity to commit a crime:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The reasons in <em>Mack</em> make clear that a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry into a location is premised upon
    and tethered to reasonable suspicion. An investigation is “<em>bona fide</em>”
    where the police have a reasonable suspicion over a location or area, as well
    as a genuine purpose of investigating and repressing crime. <span
class=Underline>A bona fide investigation is not a separate and freestanding
    way for police to entrap an individual, but a means of expressing the threshold
    of reasonable suspicion in a location. The offer of an opportunity to commit a
    crime must always be based upon a reasonable suspicion of particular criminal
    activity</span>, whether by a person, in a place defined with sufficient precision,
    or a combination of both. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Supreme Court also made clear in <em>Ahmad</em> that the police can develop reasonable suspicion either before placing a call
    to a suspected drug line or in the course of a conversation with the target: <em>Ahmad</em>,
    at para. 54. If the police do not have reasonable suspicion before a call is
    made, it must be developed during the call but before an opportunity to commit
    a crime is presented to the target: <em>Ahmad</em>, at para. 69. The Court
    explained at para. 66 what is meant by an opportunity to commit a crime:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[P]olice can make
    exploratory requests of the target, including asking whether they sell drugs,
    without providing an opportunity to traffic in illegal drugs. An opportunity
    has been provided only when the terms of the deal have narrowed to the point
    that the request is for a specific type of drug and, therefore the target can
    commit an offence by simply agreeing to provide what the officer has requested.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    this last conversation, Officer Canepa purchased heroin from the appellant on
    the three occasions that formed the basis for the guilty pleas, and on two
    other occasions from individuals whom “Prince” had sent to complete the
    transactions for him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, reasonable suspicion existed before the undercover police officer requested
    a specific quantity or type of drug from the appellant during their initial
    call. In any event, having regard to the entirety of the communications leading
    up to Officer Canepa’s first heroin purchase from the appellant, it is clear
    that reasonable suspicion to believe that the appellant was engaged in drug
    trafficking existed before the appellant again offered to sell him drugs and Officer
    Canepa placed his order for “One”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    asking the appellant for “A GR of H” in their initial conversation, Officer
    Canepa had already obtained confirmation from the appellant that he was
    “Prince”, that he was connected to the number that was given for him, and that
    he knew “Paul”. Officer Canepa also made exploratory requests, engaging in
    drug-coded language, asking the appellant if he could come see him, which Officer
    Canepa testified meant that he was asking if he could purchase drugs from him. Understanding
    Officer Canepa’s coded request, the appellant then exhibited the kind of
    caution that, as Officer Canepa also testified, is typical of drug dealers who
    are concerned that they may be communicating with an undercover police officer.
    Once he was satisfied that Officer Canepa had obtained his telephone number
    from a trusted source, the drop name “Paul”, the appellant himself used drug-coded
    language, asking the undercover officer what he was looking for, namely, what
    drugs he wanted to purchase. It was in response to the appellant’s invitation
    that Officer Canepa placed his order for “A GR of H”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    Officer Canepa dropped the inquiry following the exchange with the male who said
    he did not know who he was, the appellant renewed communications with Officer
    Canepa for the express purpose of having to “check” him, again exhibiting the
    typical wariness of drug dealers against dealing with undercover police. Having
    satisfied himself that the connection was legitimate, the appellant then reiterated
    his offer to sell drugs to Officer Canepa, asking “What do you need?”,
    drug-coded language asking what drugs he wished to purchase. It was in response
    to this repeated offer to purchase that Officer Canepa asked for “One”, again,
    drug-coded language which the appellant understood because he indicated he
    would call Officer Canepa back to tell him where to meet him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge correctly found, these circumstances did not constitute prohibited
    random virtue-testing, which the law of entrapment seeks to protect against
    because it “violates the principle that it is wrong for the police to
    manufacture crime” and prey “on the weakness of human nature to entice
    individuals into offending”: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Ahmad</span></em>, at paras.
    27-28. In the circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that the appellant
    was tempted into committing a crime when he otherwise would not have: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Ahmad</span></em>, at para. 28. Rather, after several conversations
    and careful probes to satisfy himself of the caller’s legitimacy as a drug
    purchaser, the appellant made an offer to sell drugs to Officer Canepa, which
    was accepted. Except for the initial call to “Prince”, all other communications
    were initiated by “Prince”, or by the other male individual who contacted
    Officer Canepa. As Officer Canepa formed a reasonable suspicion about the
    appellant’s trafficking activities before he created opportunities for the
    appellant to break the law, his actions fell well within the boundaries set by
    the Supreme Court in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Ahmad</span></em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>The onus rests on the appellant to establish entrapment on a balance
    of probabilities: <em>Ghotra</em>, at para. 18, citing <em>Ahmad</em>, at para.
    31. In my view, he has failed to meet this onus. </span>I see no basis for a
    finding of entrapment in this case and would uphold the trial judge’s ultimate
