lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent started a claim for false arrest,
    false imprisonment, and breaches of his rights under the <em>Canadian Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</em>. The appellant brought a motion for summary
    judgment pursuant to r. 20 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194, on the basis that the respondent’s action is statute-barred
    pursuant to ss. 4 and 5 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24. That
    motion was dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal is predicated on multiple alleged
    errors in the motion judge’s reasons, all of which are said to have led to the
    erroneous conclusion that the respondent’s action is not statute-barred. For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Brief Factual Overview</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 1999, the respondent, a Vietnamese citizen,
    came to Canada as a student. In 2001, his legal status in Canada expired, but he
    did not leave the country. In 2007, Citizen and Immigration Canada ordered his
    removal from Canada, but he remained in the country. Also in 2007, he was
    charged with and convicted of one count of possession of marijuana, for which
    he received a 3-month conditional sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2009, the respondent was placed into
    immigration detention. He was later released on terms, including that he reside
    at the home of his friend and bondsperson, Mr. John Le, and adhere to a nightly
    curfew from 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. Mr. Le also signed a $10,000 performance
    bond and a $15,000 cash bond to guarantee the respondent’s compliance with his
    release terms.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2010, the respondent married his current
    wife. In 2012, he and his wife had a child. The respondent quickly became the
    child’s primary caregiver as his wife was the sole income earner. The
    respondent maintained that he would spend his days caring for the child in the
    home where his wife and child lived, but that he would always return to the
    residence of his bondsperson at night in order to comply with the terms of his
    release.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The crux of the allegation leading to the
    respondent’s arrest, lengthy detention, and eventual deportation from Canada
    occurred on June 25, 2013 at about 10:00 a.m. On that day, Canada Border
    Services Agency (“CBSA”) officers, including Officer Erin McNamara, conducted a
    compliance check at the bondsperson’s residence. The respondent was not there.
    According to Officer McNamara’s statutory declaration, used at the immigration
    proceeding resulting in the respondent’s detention and ultimate deportation
    from Canada, she “spoke to an English speaking resident Ms. Than Luong.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Officer McNamara said that she showed Ms. Luong a
    picture of the respondent and asked if he was home. According to Officer
    McNamara, Ms. Luong responded that the respondent used to reside “in the
    basement with her daughter”, but that he had “moved out last summer” and did
    not live there anymore. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 27, 2013, the respondent was arrested
    for breach of the terms of his release and placed into detention. The
    respondent attended two detention reviews before the Immigration Division
    tribunal on July 2, 2013 and July 9, 2013. At the second review, the respondent
    filed the sworn affidavit evidence of Ms. Dau Thi Le, the mother of the
    bondsperson, Mr. Le. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In Ms. Le’s affidavit, she said that she was the
    woman who spoke to the CBSA officers on June 25, 2013, not Ms. Luong. Ms. Le said
    that she was present in the home that day because, despite her health problems,
    her daughter asked her to babysit her grandchildren. Ms. Le said that she does
    not “speak or understand English well, but [is] fluent in Vietnamese.” Even so,
    she said that she communicated with the officers in English. She described her interaction
    with the CBSA officers as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Around 12 noon on that day, two people, a man
    and a woman, came to my daughter’s home, and when I opened the door, I saw them
    in bullet proof vests and they looked like police officers to me. I asked them
    in English what happened and they showed me a photograph and asked me in
    English if Hoan Vu lived at my daughter’s house, and I answered that I did not
    know. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When my daughter returned home at 3pm on that
    day, I told her that those two people came to her home to inquire if Hoan Vu
    lived there. My daughter then told me that Hoan Vu did live in her house, … but
    only at night. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ultimately, the Immigration Division tribunal
    accepted Officer McNamara’s evidence about what Ms. Luong said in English at
    the residence and ordered the respondent detained. The detention stretched over
    467 days in what he described as a maximum-security facility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 7, 2014, well over a year after he
    was placed into detention, the respondent was escorted by CBSA officers to
    Vietnam, where he was released the next day.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Because the respondent breached his terms, Mr.
    Le’s bonds were forfeited. Mr. Le contested the forfeiture of the bonds in
    Federal Court. In the context of that litigation, CBSA Officer Derek Sliwka
    authored a document entitled “Notes to File” (“Notes”), dated March 2, 2015. Of
    course, this was after the respondent had already been removed from the
    country. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Notes were disclosed and ultimately made
    their way to the respondent. In the Notes, Officer Sliwka wrote that, in
    preparation for writing the Notes, he “reviewed the electronic systems and the
    case file along with the submission from counsel”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Officer Sliwka summarized Mr. Le’s counsel’s
    position that Officer McNamara actually encountered Ms. Le at the door of the
    bondsperson’s home on June 25, 2013, and that she “does not speak English.” Officer
    Sliwka explained that Officer McNamara maintains that she spoke to Ms. Luong
    during her investigation and that “an interpreter was contacted by phone to
    translate the specific questions asked by Officer McNamara.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a result of those Notes, the CBSA decided to
    reverse its position on the bond, settling the litigation with Mr. Le on June
    13, 2016, ultimately agreeing to return his previously forfeited funds. In an internal
    email disclosed as part of the appellant’s motion record, it is clear that a
    decision had been reached to not forfeit the bonds because it “could not be
    defended due to the inconsistencies between the [statutory declaration of
    Officer McNamara] and the notes to file.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In affidavit evidence, the respondent explained
    the many things he was dealing with during his lengthy period in custody,
    including attempting to navigate the complexities involved with being removed
    from the country while having a child who would remain in Canada. Ultimately,
    though, the respondent explains that it was not until the Notes were released
    in the context of the bonds litigation that he came to realize that he had a
    claim. As he puts it: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Previously, I had trusted the Canadian
    government and had trusted the CBSA. I had put my faith in the adjudicators at
    my detention review hearings. I believed that they were doing their job and had
    not questioned them. I had thought that at worst the CBSA had made a mistake
    and misunderstood what I had done or what was going on. I thought maybe the
    Officer didn’t realize that John’s mom didn’t speak English. I had never
    believed that the CBSA would have withheld disclosure from the Immigration
    Division indicating that it knew the Statutory Declaration of Officer McNamara
    contained errors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the respondent commenced his action
    on October 7, 2016. The motion judge summarized the respondent’s claim for
    false arrest, detention, and <em>Charter</em> breaches as follows: “[t]he claim
    arises from the actions of the CBSA in arresting and supporting the [respondent’s]
    detention in June and July 2013, and specifically presenting false evidence at
    the review hearing on July 9, 2013, regarding the information allegedly
    obtained from the woman McNamara spoke to” at the bondsperson’s home.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span

lang=EN-CA>The Reasons for Dismissing the Motion</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to his claims for false arrest,
    false imprisonment, and breaches of <em>Charter</em> rights, the respondent
    made other claims, including malicious prosecution and breach of a settlement.
    Those latter claims were struck by Schreck J. on June 1, 2018 because they
    disclosed no reasonable cause of action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant then moved for summary judgment,
    asking that the balance of the claim be struck on the basis that it was statute-barred
    by virtue of s. 5(2) of the <em>Limitations Act</em>, because the causes of
    action of false arrest, false imprisonment, and breaches of <em>Charter</em> rights are said to have been discoverable more than two years prior to the
    commencement of the action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before reviewing the motion judge’s reasons for
    dismissing the motion, it is perhaps helpful to provide a chart that summarizes
    the key dates informing the limitation period:</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argued that the torts of false
    arrest and false imprisonment arise upon arrest. As the alleged breaches of the
    respondent’s <em>Charter</em> rights are tied to the allegations involving
    false arrest and false imprisonment, they are also said to arise on the date of
    arrest. Therefore, according to the appellant, the torts advanced by the

    arrested.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge perceived some conflict in the
    law relating to when a limitation period commences for purposes of unlawful
    arrest and detention. Ultimately, though, he determined that he did not need to
    decide that issue because, in his view, even if the limitation periods for the intentional
    torts of false arrest and false imprisonment usually start on the date of
    arrest and detention, this is nothing more than a presumption. Like all limitation
    date matters, that presumption must be considered against the four-part test
    set out in s. 5(1)(a) of the <em>Limitations Act</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When considered against the four-part test in s.
    5(1)(a), the motion judge was satisfied that the presumption had been displaced
    because the respondent did not have sufficient facts on which to base his claim
    of arrest and detention until the Notes were disclosed on June 10, 2015. In addition,
    the motion judge found that, pursuant to s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <em>Limitations
    Act</em>, even if the respondent had sufficient facts by July 9, 2013 on which
    to allege wrongdoing, it would not have been appropriate to bring a claim until
    after the disclosure of the Notes. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge also rejected as “speculative
    and unpersuasive” the appellant’s suggestion that, even if the claim was not
    discoverable at the time of arrest, this resulted from the respondent’s failure
    to exercise due diligence in discovering his claim within two years of his
    arrest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the motion judge determined that,

    reasonably in the circumstances in which he found himself and could “not
    reasonably have been expected to have discovered his claim earlier than June
    2015.” </span></p>

    the two-year limitation period. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the motion judge made
    multiple errors in his decision to dismiss the motion for summary judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, leaning on this court’s decision in <em>Kolosov
    v. Lowe’s Companies Inc.</em>, 2016 ONCA 973, the appellant argues that the limitation
    periods for the torts of false arrest and false imprisonment automatically
    commence upon arrest. As the alleged breaches of the respondent’s <em>Charter</em> rights are tied to the allegations involving false arrest and false imprisonment,
    the limitation periods for those breaches are also said to commence upon the
    date of arrest. Therefore, according to the appellant, the motion judge erred
    by failing to appreciate that the torts advanced by the respondent were, for
    all intents and purposes, automatically discoverable on June 27, 2013, the date
    the respondent was arrested, or, at the very latest, July 9, 2013, when the
    respondent learned of Officer McNamara’s evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant argues that the motion
    judge erred in law by failing to articulate and apply the correct test for
    discoverability.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, even if the motion judge articulated the
    right test for discoverability, the appellant argues that he erred by making
    palpable and overriding errors of fact in arriving at the conclusion that the respondent
    had no claim to bring until the Notes were disclosed in June 2015.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fourth, the appellant contends that the motion
    judge erred by failing to appreciate that the respondent did not act with due
    diligence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the motion judge is said to have erred
    in concluding that it was appropriate within the meaning of s. 5(1)(a)(iv) and
    the circumstances of this case to delay bringing this action until after the
    Notes were disclosed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent advances an alternative argument
    in the event that the appellant’s position finds favour in this court. In
    particular, the respondent argues that because he was transported by the CBSA
    to Vietnam, rendering him detained for a period of time outside of Ontario, s.
    32 of the <em>Crown Liability and Proceedings Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50
    governs the limitation period in this case. If he is right on this, then a
    six-year (as opposed to two-year) limitation period would apply and the
    respondent’s claim would easily fall within that zone. As will become clear,
    there is no need to address this alternative argument</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the motion judge erred
    in failing to find that this court’s decision in <em>Kolosov</em> stands for
    the clear proposition that the limitation period for wrongful arrest and
    detention commences on the date of arrest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argued before the motion judge
    that the <em>Limitations Act</em> barred the respondent’s action because the
    causes of action of false arrest, false imprisonment, and breaches of <em>Charter</em> rights (as linked to the other causes of action) all crystallized and were
    discoverable on the date of the respondent’s arrest on June 27, 2013 and, at
    the latest, at the time of the detention hearing on July 9, 2013. In support of
    this proposition, the appellant relies upon this court’s decision in <em>Kolosov</em>,

    appellate authority that he argued was not overturned by <em>Kolosov</em>,<i> </i>urged
    the motion judge to instead conclude that the limitation period commenced not
    on the date of arrest, but on the date of his release from detention in
    Vietnam: <em>Mackenzie v. Martin</em>,<i> </i>[1952] O.R. 849 (C.A.), at paras.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge reviewed the issue in some
    detail, clearly expressing misgivings about the broad interpretation of <em>Kolosov</em><i> </i>being urged upon him by the appellant. Among other things, the motion judge
    looked behind the cases cited in <em>Kolosov</em><i> </i>in an effort to explain
    why the appellant’s position about the reach of <em>Kolosov</em><i> </i>was not
    as clear as suggested. The motion judge also expressed some “concern that a
    false arrest and an unlawful imprisonment may not occur at the same time.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Despite expressing these misgivings, in the end,
    the motion judge concluded that he need not resolve the parties’ disparate
    views as to whether the limitation period commenced on the date of arrest or
    release given that, even taking <em>Kolosov</em><i> </i>at its highest, it only
    created a rebuttable presumption under s. 5 of the <em>Limitations Act</em> and
    that the presumption had been rebutted in this case: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>While I have concerns with the broad
    application of <em>Kolosov</em><i> </i>urged on me by the defendant, I do not
    need to resolve the conflict in the cases in this matter. … [S]ince section
    5(1)(a) of the <em>Limitations Act</em> establishes a four-part test, I regard <em>Kolosov</em> as simply setting up a presumption (which was not rebutted in that case) that
    the cause of action arose on the date of arrest and detention or, at latest,
    the date of the second detention hearing [July 9, 2013], but it does not
    address all four parts of the test. This means I must still consider when the
    plaintiff had sufficient facts on which to base an allegation of wrongful
    arrest and detention …. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Significantly, <em>Kolosov</em> has been cited
    by this court in subsequent decisions for the very proposition disputed by the
    respondent, that the limitation period presumptively runs from the date of
    arrest: see, for example, <em>Winmill v. Woodstock (Police Services Board)</em>,
    2017 ONCA 962, 138 O.R. (3d) 641, at para. 44, <em>per</em> Huscroft J.A. (dissenting),
    leave to appeal refused, [2018] S.C.C.A. No. 39; <em>McHale v. Lewis</em>,<i> </i>2018
    ONCA 1048, 144 O.R. (3d) 279, at para. 42. Therefore, the appellant’s argument has
    some traction as to when limitation periods commence in cases of this nature. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the same time, I understand the appellant’s
    concern to be the motion judge’s characterization of the appellant’s reading of <em>Kolosov</em>, and his expression of misgiving about it. At the end of the
    day, though, the motion judge did not find that <em>Kolosov</em> stands for any
    principle broader than the presumption that a cause of action arises on the
    date of arrest and detention or, at the latest, the date of the second
    detention hearing a few weeks later. Indeed, the motion judge was prepared to resolve
    the motion on that basis. In the end, he simply resolved that the date of
    arrest – the <em>Kolosov</em> date – was the presumptive date for the commencement
    of the limitation period, but that the respondent had effectively displaced
    that presumption. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Therefore, despite having expressed misgivings
    about the appellant’s submissions, I do not read the motion judge’s reasons as unfaithful
    to the plain language of <em>Kolosov</em>.<i> </i>Rather, he accepted, however
    reluctantly, the appellant’s position that the limitation period presumptively begins
    to run at the date of arrest. This makes sense legally, given that the arrest is
    the act on which the claim is based, and is therefore the presumptive date of
    discovery of the claim: <em>Limitations Act</em>, s. 5(2). It makes sense
    practically as well, as the plaintiff will often know at the time of arrest and
    detention whether the facts alleged to justify that arrest and detention are
    false, as was the case in <em>Kolosov</em>: see 2016 ONSC 1661, at para. 119. Accordingly,
    despite his expressed concerns, the motion judge’s reasoning turned on whether
    the <em>Kolosov</em> presumptive date was rebutted pursuant to ss. 5(1) and (2)
    of the <em>Limitations Act</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I see no error in that approach. Section 4 of
    the <em>Limitations Act</em> requires an action in respect of a claim to be
    commenced within two years of the claim being discovered. Sections 5(1) and (2)
    of the <em>Limitations Act</em> read as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>5(1) A claim is&nbsp;discovered&nbsp;on the
    earlier of,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(a) the day&nbsp;on&nbsp;which the person with

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(i) that&nbsp;the&nbsp;injury,
    loss or damage had occurred,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(ii) that the
    injury, loss or damage was caused by or contributed to by an act or omission,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(iii) that&nbsp;the&nbsp;act
    or omission was that of the person against whom the claim is made, and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(iv) that, having regard
    to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would be an
    appropriate means to seek to remedy it; and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(b) the day on which a reasonable person with
    the abilities and in the circumstances of the person with the claim first ought
    to have known of the matters referred to in clause (a).</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(2) A person with a&nbsp;claim&nbsp;shall be
    presumed to have known of the matters referred to in clause (1)(a) on the day
    the act or omission on which the claim is based took place, <span
class=Underline>unless the contrary is proved</span>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Despite the presumption that <em>Kolosov</em> creates
    in relation to the running of the limitation period, s. 5(2) permits the
    contrary to be proved in accordance with the matters referred to in s. 5(1)(a).
    While that presumption was not rebutted in <em>Kolosov</em>, it <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>was rebutted here. </span></em>Accordingly, regardless
    of the hesitation expressed by the motion judge as to the reach of <em>Kolosov</em>,
    nothing in this case turns on those observations. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant next argues that, despite referring
    to the correct legal authorities respecting how to determine the date of
    discoverability based upon sufficient facts, the motion judge erred in his
    articulation and application of that test. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant notes that the discoverability
    principle is satisfied once the party has sufficient information to infer the
    material facts underlying the claim, a test that does not turn in any way upon the
    viability of the claim. The motion judge is said to have erred in failing to
    appreciate that the respondent knew all material facts by, at the latest, the
    Immigration Division hearing on July 9, 2013. By extending the discoverability
    date to June 10, 2015 – the date the Notes were disclosed – the motion judge is
    said to have erred by focusing on when the claim was more likely to succeed,
    rather than when the respondent knew the claim existed. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Limitation periods are driven by when the

    question is whether the plaintiff knows enough facts with which to bring
    forward the claim: <em>Lawless</em>, at para. 23. If the plaintiff does know
    “enough facts”, then the claim is discovered and the limitation period begins
    to run. Knowing enough facts means knowing the “material facts” that are
    necessary to make the claim: <em>Lawless</em>, at para. 28.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I reject the suggestion that the motion judge did
    not appreciate that the principle of discoverability does not turn on whether
    the claim has a likelihood of success. As the motion judge put it, “the
    discovery of a claim is also not dependent upon the plaintiff knowing that his
    claim is likely to succeed”. The motion judge was right in this regard. As
    noted by Hourigan J.A. in <em>Sosnowski v. MacEwen Petroleum Inc.</em>,<i> </i>2019
    ONCA 1005, 441 D.L.R. (4th) 393, at para. 19, a determination of when it is
    appropriate to proceed with a claim does not include “whether a civil
    proceeding will succeed.” I see nothing in the motion judge’s reasons that
    would suggest he was unfaithful to that statement of law. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To the contrary, the motion judge’s reasons demonstrate
    that he was alive to the applicable law concerning discoverability. The law
    having been correctly stated, the question really becomes whether the motion
    judge made palpable and overriding errors of fact. I will now explain why he
    did not.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> No Palpable and Overriding Errors of Fact</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant acknowledged during oral argument that
    the real core of this appeal turns on what is said to be a palpable and
    overriding error of fact made by the motion judge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claims that the motion judge erred
    in concluding that the Notes disclosed in the context of the bonds litigation brought
    anything new to the appellant’s attention. According to the appellant, the only
    way that the motion judge could have come to this conclusion would be if he had
    completely forgotten about or disregarded the Le affidavit that the appellant
    filed at the Immigration Division hearing on July 9, 2013. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'><span lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The argument goes like this. At the latest, the respondent
    knew by July 9, 2013 (the Immigration Division hearing date) that Officer
    McNamara claimed to have spoken to an “English speaking resident Ms. Than Luong”
    at the doorway on June 25, 2013. Also by July 9, 2013, it is clear from the evidence
    filed by the respondent at the Immigration Division hearing that he maintained
    that it was not Ms. Luong but rather Ms. Le who spoke with the CBSA officers at
    the front door of the residence, and that she did not speak English well. The
    appellant places importance on the fact that the Le affidavit suggests that she
    attempted to communicate with the CBSA officers in English and makes no mention
    of an interpreter. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the Le affidavit was
    fundamental to the resolution of the motion because it demonstrates that there
    was no interpreter used. And, even if there was an interpreter used, the
    appellant says that, with the McNamara statutory declaration and the Le
    affidavit in hand by July 9, 2013, it is clear that the respondent knew he had
    a claim if he wished to proceed. Therefore, the motion judge’s palpable and
    overriding error is said to be implicit in the failure to appreciate the importance
    of the Le affidavit, thereby leaving the motion judge with a distorted view of
    the importance of the new information provided in the Notes. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'><span lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based upon this line of argument, the appellant
    contends that the motion judge could not have come to the following conclusion:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-CA>In the
    particular context of this case, therefore, <span class=Underline>I find as a
    fact</span> that Vu did not have sufficient facts on which to allege wrongdoing
    by the CBSA for which he could seek damages until June 10, 2015, when he
    received the [Notes] disclosing that McNamara had used an interpreter when
    conducting her investigation in June 2013. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, it was open to the motion judge to
    arrive at this factual finding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Importantly, he based the finding upon the
    respondent’s affidavit evidence explaining that, prior to receiving the Notes
    and learning that an interpreter had been used during the interaction at the
    doorway of the bondsperson’s home, he thought that the CBSA had only made a
    mistake and misunderstood what had been communicated by the woman who answered
    the door. As the respondent put it: “I thought maybe the Officer didn’t realize
    that John’s mom didn’t speak English.” It was only after receiving the Notes
    that the respondent came to realize, as he suggests in his affidavit, that the
    CBSA had actively misled the Immigration Division. I see no error in the motion
    judge leaning on that evidence to arrive upon his conclusion as reproduced
    above. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As well, the motion judge was not oblivious to
    the Le affidavit. To the contrary, he specifically referenced it in his
    reasons, albeit in his factual overview of the case:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>July 9, 2013 – Vu attends his second detention
    review before the ID. he submits affidavits that the woman the CBSA spoke to at
    [the bondsperson’s home] on June 25, 2013, Dau Thi Le, his bondsperson’s
    mother, did not speak English well, that she did not live there but rather was
    babysitting that day, and that she said she did not know if Vu lived there.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Clearly, the motion judge was alive to the Le
    affidavit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, it was open to the motion judge to
    come to the conclusion that he did. The Notes make clear reference to the fact
    that “Officer McNamara indicates that during her investigation, she was talking
    with Ms. Than Luong and an interpreter was contacted by phone to translate the
    specific questions asked by Officer McNamara.” Yet this stood in direct
    contrast with Officer McNamara’s statutory declaration. While the truth
    undoubtedly lies somewhere and, at some point, may see the light of day, it
    cannot be said that the motion judge committed a palpable and overriding error
    when he concluded that the respondent did not have sufficient facts on which to
    allege wrongdoing until he received the Notes. Nor can it be said that there is
    anything in the Le affidavit that detracts from that conclusion. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argues that, even if a later
    discoverability date applies, the respondent did not act with due diligence in discovering
    his claim within two years of his arrest. The motion judge is said to have
    erred in concluding that this argument was, at best, “speculative and
    unpersuasive”. To the contrary, the appellant contends that the respondent
    could have discovered additional details if he had proceeded with an
    application for leave and judicial review of his detention in Federal Court. </span></p>
