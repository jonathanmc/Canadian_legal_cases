    FOR DECISION</span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, R.S.L., appeals his conviction of
    the following offences: sexual assault (x2), receiving material benefits from
    sexual services (x2), and advertising sexual services (x2). As a result of
    these convictions, the appellant was sentenced to a global sentence of seven
    and a half years, less three years pre-trial custody. He also seeks leave to
    appeal his sentence, and if leave is granted, he appeals his sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals his convictions on the
    basis that the trial judge committed a number of errors with respect to his
    factual findings. The appellant is essentially asking this court to review the
    credibility findings of the trial judge. For the following reasons, we are not
    satisfied that the trial judge committed any errors in his factual findings to warrant
    appellate intervention.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The Background Facts</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The underlying facts can be summarized as
    follows.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The allegations against the appellant involved
    three complainants: J.T., J.F., and J.L. The appellant was convicted of all
    charges related to J.T. and J.F., and acquitted on all charges in respect of J.L.
    All three complainants were in their early twenties at the time when they met
    and became involved with the appellant. The appellant was in his late forties.
    All the complainants were addicted to various types of illicit drugs, including
    cocaine and fentanyl. Because the appellant was acquitted of the charges
    pertaining to J.L., we focus our analysis only on the evidence relating to J.T.
    and J.F.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> The two complainants, who were the subject of
    the convictions, testified that they were both sexually assaulted by the
    appellant, and that at various times the appellant used his own computer to
    create an escort service advertisement on the online website known as Backpage.com.
    Both complainants, J.T. and J.F. testified that the appellant took an active
    role in the advertisement for sexual services, the provision of a room rented
    by the appellant to meet clients, the amount of fees which each of them charged
    their various clients, and the monies that should be paid to the appellant in
    return, by each complainant. The appellant also provided each of J.T. and J.F.
    with a cellular phone for communications between their clients, and at times,
    he supplied both complainants with drugs that were to be paid for through
    escorting.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant did not testify.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found the evidence of both J.T.
    and J.F. credible and reliable, and convicted the appellant of all charges
    pertaining to these two complainants. He had a reasonable doubt with respect to
    the evidence of J.L. and acquitted the appellant with respect to the charges
    pertaining to her.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The Grounds of
    Appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In oral argument, the appellant, through duty
    counsel, advanced three principal grounds of appeal, essentially attacking the
    trial judge’s credibility findings. He says that the trial judge erred:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>i.)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By drawing the impermissible inference that both
    complainants’ evidence was more credible because they repeated the same version
    of events on several previous occasions;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>ii.)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By not considering the risk of collusion by the
    various complainants, especially because J.T. and J.F. were friends; and </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>iii.)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By improperly relying on the lack of
    embellishment in both complainants’ allegations and evidence to support their
    credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Discussion</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>It must be noted at the
    outset that a trial judge’s findings of credibility are owed heightened
    deference and absent a palpable and overriding error will not be interfered
    with on appeal: <em>R. v. G.F</em>., 2021 SCC 20, 71 C.R. (7th) 1, at para. 81; <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;R.E.M.</em>, 2008 SCC, [2008] S.C.R. 3, at para. 32.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge
    committed palpable and overriding errors in his factual findings regarding the
    credibility of the complainants. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    drew the impermissible inference that both complainants’ evidence was more
    credible because they repeated the same version of events on several previous
    occasions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s argument is based on the following
    excerpt from the trial judge’s reasons, where he made certain observations.
    With respect to the evidence of J.T., he stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I find her evidence to be reliable for several
    reasons. To begin with, her version of events seemed to have remained quite consistent.
    She gave a lengthy statement to the police. She testified at the preliminary hearing.
    She gave evidence at trial. Yet I was directed to very few inconsistencies in
    her evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In reference to the evidence of the complainant,
    J.F., the trial judge stated as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>She gave a detailed statement to police,
    testified in the preliminary hearing, and gave evidence at trial. If there were
    significant changes in her story, they were not brought to my attention. In
    short, she was believable. There’s not good reason to doubt the reliability of
    her evidence and where corroboration might be expected to be found, it was.</span></p>

    judge were made within the context of arguments raised by the defence attacking
    the credibility and reliability of both complainants’ evidence, as they were
    both heavy drug users and were addicted to both fentanyl and cocaine.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his closing submissions, the defence counsel
    at trial made the following statement, which outlined his approach to the
    evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Credibility in these cases is extremely
    important. We have to look at not only what they said in examination-in-chief,
    but what they said in cross-examination, how they presented themselves, what
    issues they had concerning drug use, drug consumption and how that affected
    their memory, if any, and the type of drug that was used.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Now, Your Honour is well aware this is – We’re
    not just talking about just cocaine here. We’re talking about fentanyl. All
    three young ladies are talking about fentanyl, and I’m going to go about it in
    a different fashion than my friend. I’m going to start with [J.L.], Your
    Honour.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[J.L.] was indicating that she, after leaving
    detox in early November, relapsed and started using fentanyl. She hadn’t met
    Mr. [L.]. yet, and from what we heard, she was already escorting with her
    friend named [B.]</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In her own words. And she’s on fentanyl and cocaine.
    So, all of this is memories made by her while under, what I would put a
    tremendous amount of drugs that she’s getting from – She gets patches from
    anybody.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>And then we recall that she got into fentanyl,
    and I think it was [J.], and I stand to be corrected about [fentanyl], Your
    Honour. So, all of that affecting memory recall and otherwise. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is clear from the above excerpts that the
    defence strategy was to attack the credibility and reliability of the
    complainants’ evidence by highlighting and focusing on the impact of their
    heavy drug use and addictions on their memory, and their ability to accurately
    recall what had occurred in their lives during the time period of the
    allegations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his reasons for judgment, before making any
    reference to the consistency of the complainants’ prior statements, the trial
    judge specifically referenced the defence argument, which provided the context
    for his subsequent comments on the credibility and reliability of the
    complainants’ evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel argued that the evidence of J.T.
    was neither credible nor reliable. He pointed out that she was, during much of
    the period in question, a heavy user of fentanyl and therefore her ability to
    recall and relate evidence would necessarily be compromised. He pointed out
    that by her own admission, she recruited J.F. to work with her as an escort for
    the accused. He questioned why she would have done so if she had been sexually
    assaulted by him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was perfectly appropriate for the trial judge
    to reference the previous consistent versions of the complainants’ evidence
    within the context of defence counsel’s attack on the reliability of their
    evidence due to faulty memory, which could have been induced by the consumption
    of heavy drug use. We do not agree that the trial judge used the prior
    consistent versions as corroboration, but rather to provide important context
    for assessing the reliability of the evidence of the two complainants: </span><em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The judge’s reasons when read as a whole and in
    the context of the submissions of defence counsel at trial do not reveal any
    error that warrants appellate intervention. Accordingly, we would not give any
    effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second argument raised by the appellant is
    that the trial judge erred in not addressing the risk of collusion in the
    respective complainants’ evidence, as the two complainants were close friends
    who made very similar allegations against the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not agree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the Crown filed a similar fact
    application which was dismissed by the trial judge. The issue of innocent
    collusion was relevant only to the similar fact application. Once this
    application was dismissed, it was no longer an issue on the trial proper. On
    the trial proper, the defence’s argument was that the complainants were either
    deliberately lying, or that their evidence was unreliable because of their drug
    use and addiction. The trial judge made specific findings of fact that the complainants’
    evidence was both credible and reliable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The veracity of their evidence was not affected
    by their drug consumption. As a result, there was no merit to the argument that
    the complainants were mistaken about the material elements of the offences they
    alleged against the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both complainants were clear in their evidence
    that they were sexually assaulted by the appellant, and that they participated
    in sex work that financially benefitted the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We would not give any effect to this ground of

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the appellant argues that the trial
    judge erred in his credibility assessment of the complainants’ evidence by
    improperly relying on lack of embellishment to support the complainants’
    credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant relies on the following excerpt
    from the trial judge’s reasons to substantiate this position:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I find her to be compelling for many of the
    same reasons I found the evidence of J.T. to be compelling. Like J.T., J.F. was
    quick to admit her shortcomings, no matter the light they cast her in. She
    admitted to a longstanding addiction to drugs. She admitted to voluntarily
    working as an escort. She placed blame for her actions nowhere but on herself.
    She did not overstate or dramatize her situation. She was very matter of fact
    at setting out how her life had played out.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When she spoke of what her addiction had cost
    her, of her loss of self-respect, she did not speak angrily of Mr.&nbsp;[L.].
    Even when she described being sexually assaulted by him, she did not express
    anger or resentment towards him. Rather she described it as a point at which
    she realized that all of her self-worth had gone.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not agree with the appellant’s
    characterization of the impugned portion of the trial judge’s reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A trial judge’s reasons must be read as a whole,
    and within the context of the evidence adduced at trial. At trial, the
    appellant attacked the credibility and reliability of the complainants’
    evidence. On several occasions in closing submissions, the defence highlighted
    the fact that the complainants were heavy drug users. They were both addicted
    to fentanyl and cocaine, and were admittedly, escorts. The judge’s observation
    is simply a recognition of the forthrightness and candour of both complainants’
    evidence, a factor that goes directly to the credibility of each witness, and a
    factor that was properly within the purview of the trial judge to consider.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the result, we are satisfied that the
    findings made by the trial judge were open to him. The specific complaints
    advanced do not rise to the level required to warrant our interference. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his notice of appeal, the appellant also
    appealed his sentence on the basis that the sentence was excessive. The appellant
    was sentenced to a total of seven and a half years, less three years pre-trial
    custody. The sentence comprised of two consecutive three-year sentences for two
    counts of sexual assault on two complainants, and an additional 18-month
    consecutive sentence for the prostitution-related offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentence imposed was within the appropriate
    range, considering the nature of the offences, as well as the aggravating
    factors outlined by the trial judge.</span></p>

    was demonstrably unfit, or that the sentencing judge made an error in principle
