    to appeal both approval and vesting orders. The Receiver, concerned that these
    attempted appeals could derail the imminent closing of the Yonge Street
    property and the shortly forthcoming closing of the Eastern Avenue property,
    brought an urgent motion seeking declaratory relief, which I heard on Friday,
    August 20, 2021. While the Receiver has raised a number of issues, in light of
    how I am deciding this matter, the only issues I need to address are: (i)
    whether Mr. Kavanagh has a right to appeal the approval and vesting orders
    under s. 193(c) of the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>, R.S.C., 1985, c.
    B-3 (“<i>BIA</i>”); and, if not, (ii) whether he should be granted leave to
    appeal those orders under s. 193(e) of the <em>BIA</em>.</span></p>

    Eastern Avenue properties. It appears that Mr. Kavanagh worked for Midas as an
    in-house accountant: <em>Thomas Farrell v. John Kavanagh</em>, 2020 ONSC 8154,
    at para. 13. He was involved in arranging the mortgages on the Yonge Street and
    Eastern Avenue properties. In the materials he filed on this motion, Mr.
    Kavanagh describes himself as a “shareholder and guarantor” of Midas and its
    properties. </span></p>

style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>Midas defaulted on the mortgages. Eventually, Midas and
    Midas’ President, Thomas Farrell, started an action, alleging that the
    mortgages taken out on the two properties were unauthorized and the result of
    fraudulent activity by Mr. Kavanagh. After over seven years of litigation,
    which saw Midas and Mr. Farrell seeking judgment against Mr. Kavanagh, the
    Motion Judge (who was also the trial judge on the action) determined that the
    mortgage was valid and dismissed the action: <em>Farrell</em>,<i> </i>at para.
    124. Midas and Mr. Farrell unsuccessfully sought a stay of the decision: <em>Farrell
    v. Kavanagh</em>, 2021 ONCA 213. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[10]</span><span lang=EN-CA

    $11,045,858.94 and, when the demand was not met, applied for the appointment of
    a receiver. By order dated April 6, 2021, the Receiver was appointed over the
    assets, undertakings, and properties of Midas, including the Yonge Street and
    Eastern Avenue properties, which are the subject of this motion. </span></p>

    process for the properties was approved, and Auto World Imports, the tenant at
    the Eastern Avenue property, was directed to produce documents showing how much
    rent they had prepaid on the property.</span><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:

lang=EN-CA> Subsequently, the Receiver came to learn that: (i) the tenant had
    paid $2 million in advance rent, half of which was paid while the decision in <em>Farrell</em> was under reserve; and (ii) Midas had agreed to sell the Eastern Avenue
    Property to a company affiliated with the tenant.</span></p>

style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>Given these newly discovered facts, the Receiver entered
    into negotiations with the tenant at the Eastern Avenue property and they
    ultimately entered into an agreement of purchase and sale. Equally, the
    Receiver entered into a separate agreement of purchase and sale for the Yonge
    Street property.</span></p>

    both properties, the Receiver sought and obtained approval and vesting orders.
    Notably, the combined proceeds to be realized from the sale of the properties
    will be sufficient to pay out all encumbrances against the properties, although
    the Receiver acknowledges that it is possible that there could be a shortfall
    in respect of accrued interest depending on when distributions are authorized. </span></p>

    195 of the <em>BIA</em><i> </i>says that “all proceedings under an order or

style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>As I understand it, what has triggered this last-minute
    motion for declaratory relief is that the Receiver is concerned about the
    potential operation of s. 195 of the <em>BIA</em>. That concern rests on the
    fact that Mr. Kavanagh has filed two notices of appeal and a leave motion, all
    arising from the approval and vesting orders made pursuant to the <em>BIA</em>.
    The Receiver wants to foreclose any possible suggestion that the approval and
    vesting orders – which are required to close the sales of the Yonge Street
    property on Monday, August 23, 2021 and the Eastern Avenue property on
    Thursday, September 2, 2021 – will be the subject of automatic stays pursuant
    to s. 195 of the <em>BIA</em>. If the automatic stays apply, then the Receiver
    asks that they be cancelled. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[18]</span><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>The Receiver’s concerns are well placed given that Mr.
    Kavanagh has responded to this motion, suggesting that he has a right to appeal
    under s. 193(c) of the <em>BIA</em> and, therefore, s. 195 operates to
    automatically stay the approval and vesting orders. He says the stay should not
    be cancelled. He also argues that, if he is wrong about the right to appeal, then
    I should grant him leave to appeal and impose stays on that basis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[19]</span><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>I have concerns about whether Mr. Kavanagh even has
    standing to appeal the approval and vesting orders. The Receiver submits that
    he has no standing as a non-party with no personal stake in the proceeding. In
    the end, though, as will become clear in these reasons, it is unnecessary for
    me to settle on the question of standing. For the purposes of these reasons, I

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Kavanagh’s first position is that he has an automatic right of appeal under s.
    193(c) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>BIA</span></em>, which reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>193 Unless otherwise expressly provided, an appeal lies to the
    Court of Appeal from any order or decision of a judge of the court in the
    following cases:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>…</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(c) if the property involved in the appeal exceeds in value
    ten thousand dollars;</p>

    appeal. I agree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>This court has been clear that, given the “broad nature of the stay
    imposed by s. 195 of the&nbsp;<em>BIA</em>”, the right to appeal under s.
    193(c) must be narrowly construed: <em>First National Financial GP Corporation
    v. Golden Dragon HO 10 Inc.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, 2019 ONCA
    873, 74 C.B.R. (6th) 1,</span></em><i> </i>at para. 15, citing <em>Enroute
    Imports Inc., Re.</em>, 2016 ONCA 247, 35 C.B.R. (6th) 1, at para. 5. As noted
    by Brown J.A., the narrow construction of s. 193(c) accords with the “needs of
    modern, ‘real-time’ insolvency litigation”:&nbsp;<em>2403177 Ontario Inc. v.
    Bending Lake Iron Group Limited</em>, 2016 ONCA 225, 396 D.L.R. (4th) 635, at
    para. 53. Therefore, Brown J.A. </span>affirmed that s. 193(c) does not provide
    for an appeal as of right to matters involving: “(i) orders that are procedural
    in nature, (ii) orders that do not bring into play the value of the debtor’s
    property, or (iii) orders that do not result in a loss”: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Bending

    193(c) of the <em>BIA</em> does not apply to decisions or orders that are
    procedural in nature, “including orders concerning the methods by which
    receivers or trustees realize an estate’s assets”: <em>Bending Lake</em>, at
    para. 54. At least in relation to the appeal from the order relating to the
    Eastern Avenue property, that is precisely what Mr. Kavanagh is seeking to
    appeal as of right: the method used by the Receiver to arrive at the agreement
    of purchase and sale of the Eastern Avenue property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Kavanagh’s chief complaint is that the Receiver, as he puts it, “sought and
    obtained the Sale Process order and then abandoned that process and negotiated
    directly with one party based on new facts.” What he is referring to is the
    fact that, after receiving the May 31, 2021 court order setting out a marketing
    and sale process that the Receiver would follow for the Eastern Avenue
    property, the Receiver did not follow that process, but rather negotiated the
    sale with the current tenant at that property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Motion Judge detailed in his reasons, the Receiver acted reasonably in the
    circumstances. The Receiver had very good reason to negotiate with the tenant
    before embarking upon the marketing and sale process that had been approved in
    the May 31, 2021 order. That reason rested on the fact that it was only after
    the May 31, 2021 order was issued that the Receiver came to learn that the
    tenant at the Eastern Avenue property had prepaid $2 million in rent to Midas
    and Mr. Farrell, representing rents paid until May 31, 2027, and had actually
    entered into an agreement of purchase and sale for the property. In light of
    that state of affairs, the Receiver recognized the obvious: unlike an ordinary
    buyer, the tenant would be highly motivated to protect its financial outlay,
    and allowing the tenant to do so would avoid potentially lengthy and costly
    litigation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the Receiver did not seek an order varying the marketing and sale process set
    out in the May 31, 2021 order on the basis of the new information that had come
    to light, I am not satisfied that the Motion Judge erred in concluding that the
    Receiver acted appropriately in the circumstances. Importantly, there is no
    evidence that the manner in which the Receiver proceeded resulted in any loss.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    Mr. Kavanagh is not pleased with the Receiver’s decision to negotiate with the
    tenant, in my view, his complaint in relation to the Eastern Avenue property is
    entirely procedural in nature. At its core, his complaint is that the Receiver
    should have followed a different process for selling the Eastern Avenue
    property. Section 193(c) does not permit an appeal as of right for this type of
    procedural complaint.</p>

    193(c) grants a right of appeal where “the property involved in the appeal

    approach would lead to an automatic right of appeal in virtually all <em><span

    for s. 193(c) to apply, the order in question must contain some element of a
    final determination of the economic interests of a claimant in the debtor. T<span
lang=EN-CA>he court does not look to the total value of the property involved
    in the dispute, but to the value of the actual loss (or gain) resulting from
    the impugned order:&nbsp;<em>Bending Lake</em>, at paras. 61-64. The loss (or
    gain) must be squarely rooted in the evidentiary record. As Brown J.A. stated
    in&nbsp;<em>Bending Lake</em>,<i>&nbsp;</i>at paras. 64 and 69:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The Debtor must demonstrate some basis in the evidentiary

    could have obtained a higher sales price for the Debtor’s property. Bald
    assertion is not sufficient, otherwise a mere bald allegation of improvident
    sale in a notice of appeal could result in an automatic stay of a sale approval

    the factual record here that supports Mr. Kavanagh’s suggestion that he has
    suffered or will suffer a loss greater than $10,000. The factual record does
    not even suggest that he has suffered or will suffer any loss at all. Recall
    that he describes himself, for the purposes of this motion, as the guarantor of
    the subject mortgage. It is worth emphasizing a point made earlier: it is
    anticipated that the mortgage will be paid out as a result of the sales of the
    properties, should those sales move efficiently. Therefore, as a guarantor, Mr.
    Kavanagh should not lose on the approved sales.</span></p>

    appraisals that have been done by a reputable broker, which value the
    properties at more than the ultimate purchase price. He further shares his view
    that this appraisal is at “the low end” of what could be obtained for the
    properties through a bidding process. As noted by the Motion Judge, the
    “report” makes clear that it is not an appraisal. The report also does not
    reference the critical fact that rent had already been prepaid on the property
    until May 31, 2027, meaning that even if the property could be sold to someone
    else, it would not earn rental income for a very long time. As a commercial
    investment property, this would undoubtedly affect the value received through a
    bidding process. Moreover, having reviewed the report, it appears that the
    author of the report was told that the landlord had indicated that the tenant
    was willing to vacate the property and reoccupy only after the property had
    been redeveloped. Therefore, few of the underlying premises upon which the
    report rested accord with reality. </span></p>

    concern. Mr. Kavanagh asserts he has that right, but has not clearly identified
    from which statute that right would arise. Others on the motion say he does not
    have that right in the current circumstances. Others were unsure, identifying
    various statutes from which that right might arise. In any event, Mr. Kavanagh
    has not clearly asserted the basis for his purported right of redemption, has
    not attempted to redeem the mortgage over the past eight years during which it
