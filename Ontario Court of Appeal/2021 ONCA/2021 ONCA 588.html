  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Trotter J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These appeals arise from the sale of a business.
    Almost two years after the deal closed, things went awry. The purchasers/assignees,
    who are the appellants in this appeal, defaulted on a promissory note, secured
    by certain assets (i.e., heavy construction equipment). Without notice, the respondents/cross-appellants
    (hereafter the respondents) seized these assets from the appellants, putting
    them out of business. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondents sued for the money still owing.
    The appellants filed a counterclaim pleading breach of contract, intentional
    interference with economic relations, and the tort of conversion based on the
    seizure without notice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> In the main action, the trial judge granted
    judgment in favour of the respondents, based on the unpaid debt. She also
    dismissed the appellants counterclaim, based on her conclusion that the
    respondents were not required to provide notice to the appellants prior to seizing
    the assets.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants originally appealed from the
    judgment against them in the main action and from the dismissal of the
    counterclaim. However, at the oral hearing, they focused solely on the
    counterclaim. The respondents appeal the trial judges award of damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would allow the appeal from the dismissal of
    the counterclaim. At common law, and under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement
    (APA) entered into by the parties, the appellants were entitled to notice
    before the equipment was seized. This amounted to a breach of contract. I would
    remit the case to the Superior Court for an assessment of damages. As I see no
    error in the trial judges assessment of damages in the main action, I would
    dismiss the cross-appeal.</span></p>

    Ltd.) and its principal, Carl Priest. The respondents are 1758704 Ontario Inc.
    (175 Inc.) and 1191305 Ontario Inc. (119 Inc.) and their principal, Martin
    Donkers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In May 2010, the numbered companies entered into
    an APA, whereby 173 Ltd. Agreed to purchase the assets of 175 Inc. and 119 Inc. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The APA covered two key transactions. First, 173
    Ltd. Agreed to purchase all the assets set out in Schedule A of the APA (the
    purchased assets). This purchase was to be satisfied through a promissory note
    in the amount of $558,740.00, plus 7% annual interest, which Mr. Priest
    personally guaranteed. The note was payable by monthly blended installments
    from June 2010 to May 2013. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, 173 Ltd. Agreed to assume a number of third-party
    leases from 175 Inc. for several pieces of equipment (the leased equipment),
    as set out in Schedule B of the APA. 173 Ltd. Was to assume the leases for a
    loader and an excavator and make all subsequent payments directly to the
    lessor, John Deere. 173 Ltd. Was to assume the lease for a truck and trailer
    and make monthly payments to 175 Inc., which would remit the payments to the
    lessor, General Electric. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The numbered companies executed a General
    Security Agreement (GSA), which secured payment under the promissory note and
    granted the corporate respondents security over the purchased assets and leased
    equipment. The GSA was registered under the <i>Personal Property Security Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10 (<i>PPSA</i>).</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>173 Ltd. Properly assumed the lease for the loader and made all required
    payments to John Deere until it was paid off in December 2011. 173 Ltd. Also
    properly assumed the lease for the truck and trailer and made all required
    payments to 175 Inc. until the truck and trailer were seized in December 2012.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, 173 Ltd. Never properly assumed the lease for the excavator.
    The circumstances surrounding the failed assumption are immaterial. Suffice it
    to say, 173 Ltd. Took possession of the excavator, but made no payments on the
    lease. This resulted in arrears for which 175 Inc. was ultimately responsible
    to John Deere.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In April 2012, the respondents gave the appellants notice that there
    was $115,399.12 owing in arrears under the APA and GSA for the unassumed excavator
    lease. The notice advised that the respondents considered the arrears an
    occurrence of an event of default and, as a result, the arrears for the excavator
    lease, the amount outstanding under the truck and trailer lease, and the amount
    outstanding under the promissory note became due and payable in full. The notice
    further advised the appellants that they had 10 days to satisfy the excavator
    arrears in full, failing which the respondents would seize the appellants
    assets and sue for any shortfall. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants made no payments towards the excavator arrears but
    continued to make monthly payments under the truck and trailer lease, and the promissory
    note until November 2012. </p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Second Default: The Promissory Note</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants made every payment under the promissory
    note from June 2010 to October 2012. However, on November 18, 2012, the
    appellants gave Mr. Donkers a cheque for the truck and trailer lease, but made
    no payment on the promissory note. Instead, Mr. Donkers received an unsigned
    letter advising him that the appellants were in the final stages of obtaining
    funding to satisfy the remaining seven payments on the promissory note. The
    letter asked Mr. Donkers to call Mr. Priest to discuss. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 19, Mr. Donkers emailed Mr. Priest
    about the missing cheque. Mr. Priests response merely referenced the letter
    and asked Mr. Donkers to call him. Mr. Donkers replied by email, telling Mr.
    Priest that putting together financing to pay the balance was up to him. There
    is no evidence of any further discussion on the outstanding payment.</span></p>

    173 Ltd.s assets, including some of the purchased assets, the truck and trailer,
    and the loader. The respondents did not give the appellants notice; the appellants
    discovered that their equipment was gone on December 10, 2012 and called the
    police. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On December 14, 2012, the appellants received a

    the following: Lloyds intended to retain the seized articles; 173 Ltd. Owed
    175 Inc. and 119 Inc. $132,634 for late payments; and Lloyds would be
    charging ongoing storage fees at $900 per day, or $27,000 per month. The equipment
    was stored at Call Service Towing/Classic Towing and Storage (Call Service),
    and the storage fees from the date the assets were seized to the date they were
    sold totalled $160,200.</span></p>

    another business out of the same address as Call Service and used Call Service
    to store some of his own equipment. Mr. Donkers storage costs were considerably
    less: $1,500 per month for roughly 35% less space than that required to store
    the seized assets.</span></p>

    the equipment unusable, but without removing it from the debtors premises.
    Section 63 then grants the creditor the right to dispose of the secured goods,

    speaks to disposition. In Jacob S. Ziegel, David L. Denomme &amp; Anthony
    Duggan, <i>The Ontario Personal Property Security Act  Commentary and Analysis</i>,
    3<sup>rd</sup> ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2020), the authors describe the

    expect to be able to act. The application of this simple proposition will
    depend upon all the facts and circumstances in each case. Failure to give such
    reasonable notice places the debtor under economic, but nonetheless real
    duress, often as real as physical duress to the person, and no doubt explains
    the eagerness of the courts to construe debt-evidencing or creating documents

    was tethered to the November 2012 default on the promissory note, not the April
    2012 default concerning the excavator lease. Indeed, the trial judge found that
    Mr. Donkers acted out of spite when he did not tell Mr. Priest he was treating
    the missed payment as a default (at para. 96).</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge erred in dismissing the
    counterclaim. As the Supreme Court held in <i>Got Electric</i> at paras. 20-21,
    the seizure of assets without notice amounts to a breach of contract. The same
    set of circumstances may also support an action for the tort of conversion. In
    that case, the Court decided that it was unnecessary to consider whether
    conversion was made out because the quantum of damages would not differ,
    whether liability sounded in contract or in tort (at pp. 418-419). Here too,
    having found that the respondents conduct amounted to a breach of  contract,
    it is not necessary to address the tort claim.</span></p>

    above, the appellants rely upon the APA, which also provides a duty to give
    notice in the event of default. Para. 3.03 of the APA provides:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>3.03   That <u>upon default of any payment</u> owing hereunder <u>the
    Vendor shall forthwith provide notice of such default to the Purchaser</u> or
    its solicitor by fax or by electronic communication at fax numbers or email
    addresses to be designated by the Purchaser. <u>Upon such default existing for
    a period of fifteen (15) days following receipt notification of such default</u>,
    the Vendor shall thereafter be entitled to forthwith have all licences and
    certificates howsoever related to the assets included hereunder reverted back
    to name of the Vendor or as it might direct which to such reversion of said
    licences and certifications the Purchaser does hereby consent and agree.
    Further in the event of such default, the Vendor shall have the right to seize
    all chattels and assets included hereunder pursuant to its security
    documentation however to mitigate its losses and without interference from the
    Purchaser. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    in her reasons. The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in failing to
    give effect to this provision in relation to the default on the promissory
    note. The respondents submit that the notice provision in Article 3.03 is
    inapplicable because it merged on closing.</span></p>

    transactions involving personal property, such as goods: G.H.L. Fridman, <i>The
    Law of Contract in Canada</i>, 6<sup>th</sup> ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters
    Canada Limited, 2011), at p. 566. Moreover, even when applicable, merger is not
    automatic; it is the intentions of the parties that must prevail: <i>Fraser-Reid</i>,

    make no sense if it were to merge upon closing. The entire transaction, for
    both purchased and leased equipment, was structured on installment payments to

    the default on the promissory note.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The failure to provide notice was not an
    academic exercise or a mere formality in this case. The record before the trial
    judge established that, in October 2012, the appellants applied to their bank
    for financing to retire the balance on the promissory note, which was roughly
    $120,645 at the time. Just days after the illegal seizure, on December 12,
    2012, the bank approved the advance of $122,000.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given my conclusion that the appellants were
    entitled to notice at common law and according to the terms of the APA, it is
    not necessary to address the appellants alternative argument that the duty of
    good faith in the performance of contracts required the respondents to give
    notice of its intention to seize the appellants assets. The application of
    this duty would be especially difficult in this case given the trial judges apt
    finding, at para. 95: To be frank, both parties acted dishonourably.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would set aside the trial judges order
    dismissing the counterclaim, allow the counterclaim, and remit the matter to
    the Superior Court for an assessment of damages. During her submissions at the
    hearing, appellants counsel advised us that the matter could be addressed in
    writing because the trial judge heard all of the evidence relevant to this
    issue. While that may well be the case, the matter of how to proceed is best
    determined by that court.</span></p>

    Priest were liable for failing to properly assume the excavator lease. At para.
    48 of her reasons, the trial judge found, [b]ased on the evidence before me, I
    am satisfied that Mr. Priest failed to assume the Excavator lease pursuant to
    the Agreement. She awarded damages against both 173 Ltd. And Priest. This
    finding may well have been inadvertent, a simple result of failing to
    distinguish between Priest and his company. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nonetheless, I agree with the appellants that
    the trial judge erred in awarding damages against Mr. Priest personally. Mr.
    Priest was not a party to the APA. Although he was personally liable on the
    promissory note, the note only applied to purchased assets, not leased
    equipment. In the absence of findings that would support a decision to pierce
    the corporate veil, and there were none, this part of the trial judges order

    judges assessment of damages must be accorded significant deference unless
    tainted by an error in principle, or is unreasonably high or low: <i>Awan v.

    of damages. She noted that there was $33,661.33 outstanding on the lease
    between the seizure and sale of the truck and trailer. General Electric
    repossessed the truck and trailer from Mr. Donkers and consigned them to a
    third party, which sold the equipment at auction for $101,500. The third party
    paid General Electric the outstanding $33,661.33 and remitted the remaining
    $65,538.67 to Mr. Donkers. That amount was then properly credited to Mr.
    Priest. Since Mr. Donkers was never required to make any payments to General
    Electric for the truck and trailer, there was no basis upon which to award him

    J. approved the respondents expenses at $236,082.65, which included $160,200
    for the 178 days the seized assets were stored at Call Service. However, the
    trial judge found the $900 per day storage fee was excessive. Mr. Donkers had
    eight months (from April 2012, when the appellants received the 2012 Notice, to
    December 2012, when the respondents seized 173 Ltd.s assets) to find a
    suitable facility at a reasonable rate, yet there was no evidence he made any
    effort to look elsewhere than Call Service. Considering the rate Mr. Donkers
    was paying to store his own equipment with Call Service, the trial judge
    concluded $10,000 was a reasonable monthly fee, for a total of $60,000 for the
    roughly six months the seized assets spent in storage. Accordingly, she gave
    Mr. Priest a $100,200 credit, representing the excessive storage fees.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
