  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Rouleau J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>2161907 Alberta Ltd. (“<strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>216</span></strong>”) holds the Ontario rights to
    the “Tokyo Smoke” cannabis brand, which it licenses to various retail
    operators. 11180673 Canada Inc. (“<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>111</span></strong>”)
    and its principal, Mr. Robert Heydon, won a cannabis retail operator license in
    the allocation lottery held by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (“<strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>AGCO</span></strong>”) in August 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In November 2019, the parties entered into a series
    of agreements for the operation of a Tokyo Smoke-branded cannabis store in
    Toronto. These agreements included a License Agreement for the use of the Tokyo
    Smoke brand and a Sublease whereby 111 rented the retail premises from 216. 216
    offered 111 funding for start-up costs, including rent, and an inducement of
    approximately $2 million to open under the Tokyo Smoke banner (the “Branding
    Fee”). The Branding Fee would come due once 111 obtained its Retail Store
    Authorization from the AGCO. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Two days before the store was supposed to open,
    a dispute arose as to 216’s obligation to fund the payment of 111’s rent for the
    month of opening. Faced with 216’s refusal to pay, 111 advised 216 that it
    would not be opening the store as planned. 216 took the position that this was
    a threat to cease carrying on business and accordingly constituted a breach of
    their agreement. 216 terminated its relationship with 111, refusing to pay the Branding
    Fee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>216 brought an application seeking a declaration
    that 111 had breached the various agreements in effect between the parties,
    that the Branding Fee was not payable to 111, and that 111 must therefore
    vacate the retail premises. 111 brought a counter-application seeking, among
    other things, payment of the Branding Fee and a declaration that 216 had wrongfully
    terminated the License Agreement and breached its duty of good faith in the
    performance and enforcement of contractual relations. The application judge
    dismissed 216’s application and granted 111’s application. She declared that
    216 had no valid reason to terminate the agreements, that it had acted in bad
    faith, and ordered 216 to pay the Branding Fee.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>Issues</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>216 raises three issues on appeal:</span></p>

    judge err in failing to issue a declaration that the Sublease between the
    parties was validly terminated on August 5, 2020?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would set aside
    the finding of bad faith, but would dismiss the balance of the appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In August 2019, 111 won the right to apply for a
    Retail Operator Licence and Retail Store Authorization in the AGCO allocation
    lottery, permitting 111 to open a retail cannabis store.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>216 approached Mr. Heydon with a proposal that
    he open his retail location under the “Tokyo Smoke” banner for which 216 held
    the Ontario rights under licence from a subsidiary of Canopy Growth Corporation
    (“Canopy”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Between November 1 and November 7, 2019, the
    parties entered into the three agreements at issue in this case:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-CA>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under the Sublease, 111 rented the retail
    premises, as Subtenant, from 216, as Sublandlord, at a monthly rent of
    $105,409.03. 216 in turn rented the premises from First Capital Holdings
    (Ontario) Corporation.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-CA>b.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under the License Agreement, 216 granted 111 the
    right to use Tokyo Smoke brand marks in the retail storefront and in its
    marketing materials subject to 216’s rights of supervision. The License
    Agreement stipulated that 216 would pay 111 an up-front Branding Fee of approximately
    $2 million upon the fulfillment of certain conditions, including the issuance
    of a Retail Store Authorization by the AGCO.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-CA>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under the Loan Agreement, 216 agreed to advance
    roughly $1.5 million in start-up costs to 111.</span></p>

    provided for a maximum loan of up to $750,000, plus the aggregate amount of
    rent due under the Sublease up to the opening of the store. Loan A was intended
    to finance construction improvements to the premises, decorations, security,
    point of sale systems, and other equipment.</span></p>
  <p class=NumberedPara style='line-height:normal'><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties anticipated that the store would
    open in early June 2020.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 31, 2020 Mr. Heydon wrote to 216 to
    confirm that he could draw on Loan A to pay June rent. 216’s representative,
    Mr. Graydon Calvert, advised Mr. Heydon that the draw was limited to the
    prorated amount of $10,540 for the first three days of June before the store
    opened. This left 111 with a shortfall of $95,000 in rent for the month.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The next day, June 1, Mr. Heydon sought the
    additional $95,000 in rent for June. Mr. Justin Farbstein, the president of
    216, responded that Mr. Heydon was “at the max of the facility” and that he was
    “not able to grant more.” As it turned out, Mr. Farbstein was mistaken. He would
    later admit on cross-examination that Loan A should have covered the amounts
    sought by Mr. Heydon.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Faced with 216’s refusal to fund the balance of
    the June rent, Mr. Heydon responded: “Please inform Canopy that we will NOT be
    opening. I will lay off the staff tomorrow.” Mr. Farbstein called Mr. Heydon
    that same evening to “calm him down”, indicating that he could likely arrange
    to have the rent payment deferred and that, in any event, the Branding Fee
    would soon be paid. It was more than sufficient to cover rent for June. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the morning of June 2, the AGCO gave 111
    final approval to open for business. 111 forwarded the approval notice to 216 as
    proof that the final condition for the payment of the Branding Fee had been
    satisfied. Mr. Farbstein again confirmed, on behalf of 216, that the Branding
    Fee would be paid later in the week in accordance with the License Agreement
    now that all conditions for the payment of the Branding Fee had been met.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the late morning of June 2, Mr. Farbstein reviewed
    the License Agreement and concluded that Mr. Heydon’s statements  the previous
    day that 111 would not be opening the store constituted a “threat to cease to
    carry on business” contrary to the License Agreement. Mr. Farbstein indicated
    in cross-examination that he sought instructions from 216’s parent company and
    communicated with both external and internal counsel. Then, at around noon on
    June 2, Mr. Farbstein instructed external counsel to begin drafting a notice
    terminating the License Agreement. 216 pulled its staff from the retail
    premises and, at 4:26 p.m., sent 111 a “Notice of Defaults” indicating that the
    License Agreement had been terminated. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Heydon did not follow through on his threat.
    111 responded to 216’s Notice of Defaults through counsel and carried on with
    the planned opening. The store opened to the public on June 3, 2020.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>216 did not pay the Branding Fee. On July 2,
    2020, it commenced this application seeking, among other things, a declaration
    that the License Agreement was validly terminated.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>111 did not make its June and July rent
    payments. On August 5, 2020, 216 gave notice of termination of the Sublease,
    citing the missed rent payments. 216 subsequently amended its notice of
    application to seek a further declaration that the Sublease was validly
    terminated on August 5 as a result of unpaid rent.</span></p>

    216 was looking for a way to end the relationship with 111, that 216 had
    “pounced” on the statement made by Mr. Heydon as a way to terminate the

    statements made to different representatives of 216 and Canopy. 216 further
    submits that it was an error of law for the application judge to have expected 216
    to discern Mr. Heydon’s subjective intention for the statements, and for the

    involves questions of mixed fact and law. A trial judge’s interpretation and
    application of contractual terms is owed deference on appeal: <em>Sattva
    Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp.</em>, 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the application judge was called
    upon to determine whether the statements made by Mr. Heydon on June 1
    constituted a “threat to cease to carry on business” for the purposes of paragraph
    26(c) of the License Agreement. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Sattva</em>,
    at para. 47, “[t]he overriding concern is to determine the intent of the
    parties and the scope of their understanding” by reading the contract as a
    whole and giving the words used their ordinary and grammatical meaning
    consistent with the surrounding circumstances known to the parties at the time of
    formation of the contract.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Unfortunately, the application judge did not
    expressly grapple with the scope or purpose of paragraph 26(c), nor did she explore
    the parties’ intentions in including it in their agreement. On appeal, neither
    party sought to explain the rationale for paragraph 26(c). Without this crucial
    framing, it is difficult to determine whether Mr. Heydon’s statements were, as
    a matter of contractual interpretation, threats for the purposes of paragraph
    26(c). In other words, while, on their face, Mr. Heydon’s statements were a
    threat not to open, were these threats that would trigger default under the
    License Agreement? </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, there are at least two possible
    interpretations of paragraph 26(c), one of which the application judge
    implicitly adopted and the other she implicitly rejected.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under the first interpretation, paragraph 26(c)
    seeks to prevent the licensee from making what are, on their face, threats to
    cease carrying on business or threats to take any action to liquidate its
    assets. In other words, the clause is directed at preventing the licensee from
    making these kinds of statements whether or not the licensee intends to carry
    out the threatened action or the licensor expects that the threat will be
    carried out. The logic behind such an interpretation would be that the License
    Agreement was set to last for a 10-year initial term. Threats and brinkmanship
    exhibited by the licensee would be corrosive to such a long-term relationship,
    especially if such threats were used as a negotiating or pressure tactic.
    Moreover, as Mr. Farbstein repeatedly stressed in his evidence, 216 was
    concerned about preserving its relationship with Canopy, the master licensor of
    the Tokyo Smoke brand. Threats of closure by a branded store, whether acted
    upon or not, might be viewed as injuring the brand.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second interpretation would require the
    threat to be objectively credible in order to trigger default under the
    agreement. This second interpretation recognizes that the language of paragraph
    26(c) contemplates more than threats to cease to carry on business: it is also
    an event of default under paragraph 26(c) for 111 to take action or threaten to
    take action to liquidate its assets, or to stop making payments in the usual
    course of business. Taken as a whole, paragraph 26(c) can be viewed as seeking
    to preserve the licensor’s rights in the event of a looming insolvency. Indeed,
    paragraph 26(d), addresses formal insolvency proceedings, and paragraph 26(e)
    makes it an event of default for 111 to “cease to operate the Business at the
    Store for a period of more than thirty (30) consecutive days”. It is reasonable
    that 216 would seek to preserve its right to terminate the License Agreement in
    such circumstances, both to pre-empt the uncertainty associated with insolvency
    and to avoid its brand materials becoming associated with a defunct or
    inoperative storefront in a fashionable neighbourhood. Viewed through this
    lens, paragraph 26(c) is directed toward credible threats to cease to carry on
    business which would require 216 to take action to preserve its intellectual
    property rights. From the application judge’s reasons, it is apparent that she
    interpreted paragraph 26(c) in this way. Such an interpretation is reasonable
    in the circumstances and I see no basis to interfere.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge correctly noted that 111’s
    communications during the evening of June 1 had to be viewed in context. Mr. Heydon
    had just been told that 216 would not be advancing the money needed to pay the
    June rent. He believed that this was a breach of 216’s obligation pursuant to
    the agreements between the parties. It turned out that he was in fact correct
    in that regard and 216 ought to have financed the payment of the June rent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 1, 2020, as a consequence of 216’s
    mistake, Mr. Heydon was faced with an unexpected shortfall of $95,000. There
    was therefore uncertainty as to whether 111 could be ready to open on June 3. </span></p>

    chain between Canopy and Mr. Heydon and between 216 (represented by Mr. Calvert
    and Mr. Farbstein) and Mr. Heydon from June&nbsp;1. These emails show that Mr. Heydon
    was reacting to the fact that he had been denied the June rent advance:</span></p>

    comments? As discussed in last nights email we fund the prorated portion of

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Heydon - 7:38 pm: The other 95k…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Farbstein - 7:41 pm: Rob – you are at the max

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In a separate email to Canopy at 8:16 p.m. with

    with these exchanges ongoing, Mr. Farbstein called Mr. Heydon “to calm him
    down” and reassure him that “everything was going to be ok.” He reiterated that
    216 would pay 111 the Branding Fee as agreed. In other words, Mr. Farbstein responded
    to the threat in a manner suggesting that he could address Mr. Heydon’s
    concerns and that a closure could and would be avoided. In fact, by the time
    the Notice of Defaults was sent, it would have been apparent that Mr. Heydon
    was moving forward with the planned opening. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given the context, I see nothing unreasonable in
    the application judge’s conclusion that Mr. Heydon’s communication did not
    constitute a threat entitling 216 to terminate the License Agreement. An
    objective observer would understand that Mr. Heydon was facing a problem: how
    was he to cover the June rent and open on June 3 given the last-minute wrongful
    withholding of needed funds? Indeed, despite Mr. Heydon’s threat not to open
    and to lay off staff, his frustration provided an objective manifestation of
    his strong desire to open as planned, not an intent to shutter the store.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Contrary to 216’s submission, the application
    judge’s finding that Mr. Heydon’s behaviour was “an emotional response to being
    given incorrect information at a critical time” was not simply based on Mr. Heydon’s
    subjective frustration. It was based on the application judge’s objective
    assessment of the parties’ exchanges in light of the language of the agreement
    and the factual context. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, on this record, the application
    judge’s finding that Mr. Heydon’s emotional frustration, viewed in context, did
    not meet the requirements of the parties’ termination clause was clearly reasonable.
    For the threats to be treated as an event of default under the License
    Agreement, a degree of objective credibility – or objective intent – or a real
    risk that Mr. Heydon’s threats would be carried out was required. As a finding
    of mixed fact and law, the application judge’s conclusion is owed deference on
    appeal and I see no basis to interfere. </span></p>

    However, 216 argues that the application judge erred in law in finding that 216
    had breached that duty or the common law duty of good faith in contractual
    performance. In 216’s submission, the application judge equated what she held
    was an invalid termination of the License Agreement with bad faith because 216 was
    looking for a way to get out of the relationship. 216 takes the position that a
    party does not act in bad faith merely because its error concerning its
    contractual termination rights achieved an additional objective, fulfilling its
    desire to end the relationship.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>111 for its part argues that 216 acted in bad
    faith by misleading 111 about the funds available to it under Loan A and by
    leading 111 to believe that the Branding Fee would be paid and the rent
    deferred. Shortly after giving these assurances, 216 terminated the License
    Agreement. In its factum, 111 submits that this conduct “revealed 216’s true
    intention, namely, to seek to end its relationship with 111 and seize 111’s
    business without paying the Branding Fee and without compensating 111”. 111
    submits that all of these findings were open to the application judge on this
    record and constitute a breach of 216’s duty of honest performance.</span></p>

    principle of the common law of contract. The court also recognized a more
    specific “manifestation” of the organizing principle in the duty to act
    honestly in the performance of contractual obligations: at para. 33. In this
    case, there is no issue as to the existence of a duty of good faith since the
    parties expressly stipulated such a duty in the License Agreement. The issue is

    After knowingly misleading 111 in this way, it simply terminated the agreement.

    critical in this respect. As I will explain, it is apparent from the
    application judge’s finding on this point that, when Mr. Farbstein informed 111

    position. The critical issue, however, is whether Mr. Farbstein or 216
    knowingly misled 111: <em>Bhasin </em>at para. 73. In this respect, it is
    significant that the application judge found that Mr. Farbstein did not lie to
    111 at any point. Further, nothing in the application judge’s reasons suggest
    that she rejected any element of Mr. Farbstein’s testimony or made an adverse
    credibility finding against him. Mr. Farbstein’s evidence on at least three key
    points indicates that he never intended to mislead 111 or Mr. Heydon.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, Mr. Farbstein admitted on
    cross-examination that he was mistaken when he told Mr. Heydon that 216 was not
    required to fund the June rent. He did not lie or knowingly withhold
    information. Thus, while 111 received false information, there is no basis for
    saying that 216 knowingly misled 111. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, Mr. Farbstein gave evidence that when he
    called Mr. Heydon during the evening of June 1 to “calm him down”, he did not
    say that 111 was in default because he did not believe 111 was in default at
    that time. He told Mr. Heydon that 216 would pay the Branding Fee later in the
    week and that it would work with the landlord to defer rent until 111 was able
    to pay, as appears from the following excerpt from Mr. Farbstein’s cross-examination:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q: Say, at the time you made this statement
    that you would pay the Branding Fee later that week and you would go speak to
    the landlord about deferring rent, those statements were true at the time you
    made them, right?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A: Correct. <span class=Underline>Those are
    true</span>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q: And you didn’t tell him in that phone call
    that his agreements with 216 were at risk of being terminated, did you?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A: I didn’t tell
    him because at that point, I had – it wasn’t in my head at risk of being – <span
class=Underline>I hadn’t thought about terminating at that point</span>. I was
    thinking to try and just – so I do tell him that. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, Mr. Farbstein admitted that his email of
    June 2 at 9:24 a.m., in which he reiterated that the Branding Fee would be paid
    and a rent deferral sought, was honest and reflected his true intention at the
    time, despite the fact that 216 was considering ways to terminate the
    relationship. He stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: Did you say at that point in time, 9:24 a.m. on June 2nd,
    you didn’t think he was in default or you wouldn’t have written that, right?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: That’s what I said.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: <span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>At that point at
    9:24, I did not think he was in default because at that point, I had not
    re-reviewed the License Agreements</span></span>. So I thought at that point he
    wasn’t in default and that I owed him the Branding Fee at that point in time,
    9:24, when I sent that email. You’re correct.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: Was [216] looking for a way to get out of the relationship
    with 111?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: On the morning of June 2nd, it
    was looking for a way to end the relationship with 111, correct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Taken together, the uncontradicted evidence is
    that 216 did not, at any point, knowingly mislead 111 about its intention with
    respect to the Branding Fee or the deferral of rent. In fact, because the
    application judge made a finding that Mr. Farbstein did not lie to 111, it is
    apparent that the assurance given to Mr. Heydon reflected Mr. Farbstein’s
    honest belief at the time they were made. He had not reviewed the agreements or
    spoken with counsel. Mr. Farbstein explained that he did not form a concrete
    intention to terminate the agreement until after 9:24 a.m. on June 2, at which
    point he had reviewed the License Agreement and determined that Mr. Heydon’s
    threat gave 216 cause to terminate and that the Branding Fee was no longer due.
    He then contacted internal and external counsel to “validate” his thoughts on
    the termination before instructing external counsel to draft a notice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>216 did not, as 111 suggests, actively mislead 111.
    It simply changed positions in light of new information. The application judge
    made no finding that the change in position was taken dishonestly or
    unreasonably nor is there any suggestion that it was taken capriciously or arbitrarily.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> “Pouncing” by 216 did not constitute bad faith</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge’s conclusion that 216
    acted in bad faith is more plausibly anchored to her finding that 216 “pounced on
    a single statement made by Mr. Heydon as a basis to trigger default, thereby
    achieving its goal of ending the relationship … and attempting to discharge its
    obligation to pay the Branding Fee”. In my view, however, 216’s act of pouncing
    did not constitute bad faith in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Setting aside the factual question of whether Mr.
    Heydon made a “single statement” or several statements, the more fundamental difficulty
    I have with this as a basis for finding that there was a breach of the duty of honest
    performance and bad faith on the part of the appellant is that the application
    judge made no finding of dishonesty and such a finding cannot be inferred from
    her reasons. A party is not prevented from exercising a right of termination
    simply because it wishes to bring its relationship with the other party to an
    end. Nor should a party be prevented from ending a relationship because it will
    deprive the defaulting party of a payment that it would have received had the
    relationship continued. Where a party is anxious to end a relationship, and a valid
    reason to do so presents itself, that party is not, in the absence of some
    other relevant fact, prevented from “pouncing” on it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While 216’s basis for terminating the License
    Agreement ultimately proved invalid, as discussed above, its position on
    termination was not unreasonable, malicious, or so inconsiderate of 111’s
    legitimate contractual interests as to constitute bad faith. It was neither
    manufactured nor concocted. Mr. Farbstein believed Mr. Heydon’s threat
    constituted a breach. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also see no basis for concluding that 216’s
    change in position was capricious or arbitrary. Mr. Farbstein reviewed the
    License Agreement and spoke with counsel before taking the position that Mr.
    Heydon’s threat constituted an event of default.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Farbstein’s conduct following Mr. Heydon’s
    threatening statements is consistent with Mr. Farbstein having viewed Mr.
    Heydon’s communication as a genuine and credible threat, even if he did not
    immediately recognize that such a threat could constitute an event of default
    under the License Agreement. Mr. Farbstein called Mr. Heydon because “at ten
    months trying to get the store opened and I was threatened two nights before
    the store was opened that it wasn’t going to be open, and so, my reaction was
    to try to calm him down” … “If I wasn’t concerned, I wouldn’t call him. I was
    concerned.” He then promised and ultimately did speak with the landlord about a
    possible rent deferral, and reported on the situation to 216’s parent company
    at least twice between 8:30 p.m. on June 1 and 10:00 a.m. on June 2. Mr.
    Farbstein’s actions suggest that he saw Mr. Heydon’s communications as more than
    empty threats or posturing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While Mr. Farbstein may well have understood by
    sometime on June 2 that, despite his threat, Mr. Heydon would in fact open the
    store on June 3, 216 had an  interest in ending such threats, especially those
    sent directly to Canopy, 216’s master licensor. As I have noted, it is possible
    to read paragraph 26(c) of the License Agreement as permitting termination when
    a party makes what, on its face, is a significant threat, even if such threat is
    later withdrawn or may be considered unlikely to be carried out. Such an
    interpretation acknowledges 216’s legitimate contractual interest in preserving
    its own relationship with Canopy and enjoying a commercial relationship with
    111 free of brinkmanship. As Mr. Farbstein deposed: “That type of [threatening]
    behaviour by 216’s sublicensees may cause Canopy to lose confidence in 216, and
    undermine its business relationship”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence is that the relationship between
    216 and 111 was “difficult” because Mr. Heydon bristled at any intervention by
    216. The threat was, from 216’s perspective, serious. As the application judge
    observed:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>216 saw 111’s threat as a “shakedown” for

    directly to Canopy worried 216 that this could cause Canopy to lose confidence
    in it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Farbstein confirmed in his evidence that, by
    June 2, 216 had serious reservations about being in business with 111 for the
    next 10 years. As he admitted on cross-examination, Mr. Farbstein returned to
    the License Agreement early on June 2 with a view to determining whether the
    threat constituted a breach that justified terminating the relationship with
    111: “I, you know, took some time and re-looked at the License Agreement and
    believed that the email that happened the night before may be cause for
    termination of License Agreement because I perceived that as a threat”. The
    breach he ultimately invoked was based on 216’s understanding that the threat
    was the type of threat contemplated by paragraph 26(c). That interpretation was
    wrong but, absent a finding that it was a position manufactured to achieve 216’s
    objective of ending the relationship, an unreasonable position, or a position
    taken capriciously or arbitrarily, it constitutes an error and no more. This
    was a fluid situation at a crucial point in the commercial relationship with
    both parties evaluating and re-evaluating their legal rights in real time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the finding that  216 had a desire
    to end its relationship with 111 and chose to “pounce” on what, incorrectly, it
    saw as providing the opportunity to do so was not sufficient to justify a
    finding of bad faith. I would therefore set aside the application judge’s
    finding of bad faith.</span></p>

    express finding on this point, 111 submits that such a finding is implied in
    her conclusion that 216 pounced on 111’s statement “to trigger default, thereby
    achieving its goal of ending the relationship with Mr. Heydon and attempting to
    discharge its obligation to pay the Branding Fee”.</span></p>

    the Supreme Court explained that a party has a duty not to evade its

    artificial reason to terminate a contract in order to avoid future payment
    obligations would likely be found to have acted in bad faith. However, as
    explained above, 216 believed the termination was justified. The fact that
    termination releases a party from making a significant payment does not amount
    to bad faith, even where a court later finds that the termination was invalid.</span></p>

    Without an adverse credibility finding against Mr. Farbstein or some other reason
    to reject his testimony, there is no basis for 111’s suggestion that the
    termination of the License Agreement was an excuse manufactured by 216 to avoid
    payment of the Branding Fee. If 216’s goal of ending the relationship with Mr.
    Heydon was achieved legitimately by the exercise of an express termination
    right, it would, as far as Mr. Farbstein understood at the time, result in the
    discharge of 216’s obligation to pay the Branding Fee. This alone does not support

    interpretation of the License Agreement that caused Mr. Heydon’s “emotional
    response”, which 216 then claimed was a “threat” in violation of the License Agreement.
    216’s attempt to seize upon the consequences of its own mistake is arguably
    another way that 216 sought to evade its contractual obligations in bad faith,

    In <i>Mason</i>, a vendor of real property attempted to repudiate an agreement
    of sale on the basis that he was “unable or unwilling” to remove a defect on

    there was no deliberate attempt to create the conditions giving rise to 216’s
    right of termination. While Mr. Heydon’s reaction was, in the sequence of
    events, a default of 216’s own making, it is not analogous to the vendor’s
    actions in <i>Mason</i>. In my view, it would not be appropriate to
    characterize 216’s error as bad faith simply because that error set in motion
    the events that would culminate with 216’s invalid termination of the License

    the termination right in question formed part of the parties’ bargain and
    reflected, among other things, the licensor’s legitimate interest in protecting
    its brand in circumstances that the parties expressly stipulated would give
    rise to a right of termination. The fact that Mr. Farbstein erroneously
