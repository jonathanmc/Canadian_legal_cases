  <p><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Fairburn A.C.J.O.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><strong><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></strong></h1>

    for family law purposes. The central issue on appeal is this:</span></a></p>
  <p class=CQuote><a name="_Hlk82426746"><span lang=EN-CA>Where a retired member
    spouse’s pension payments are divided at source for family law purposes, can
    the parties agree (or can a court order or can an arbitrator award) that
    payment sharing continue to the non-member spouse’s estate for the balance of
    the retired member spouse’s life?</span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On a motion to decide a question of law under
    Rule 16(12)(a) of the <em>Family Law Rules</em>, O. Reg. 114/99 (“<i>FLR</i>”),
    the motion judge answered this question in the negative.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> He concluded that the <em>Pension
    Benefits Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8 (“<em>PBA</em>”) specifically precludes
    a deceased non-member spouse’s share of a retired member’s pension payments
    from continuing to the non-member’s estate after the non-member’s death. In
    other words, the motion judge concluded that the death of the non-member spouse
    necessarily results in their share of the pension payment reverting back to the
    member spouse.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Respectfully, I disagree. There is nothing in
    the <em>PBA</em>, the <em>Family Law Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (“<em>FLA</em>”),
    or the <em>Family</em><em> Law Matters</em>, O. Reg. 287/11<i> </i>(“Regulation”)
    (one of the regulations under the <em>PBA</em>) that precludes the parties from
    agreeing to, a court from ordering, or an arbitrator from awarding a
    continuation of shared pension payments to the deceased non-member’s estate for
    the balance of the member spouse’s life. Indeed, when these provisions are read
    together as a cohesive unit, they leave open the possibility of proceeding in
    exactly this way. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties were married for just over 33 years. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During their marriage, Adrianna was a teacher.
    Over the course of her career, Adrianna paid into the Ontario Teachers’ Pension
    Plan (“OTPP”). Upon her retirement on June 30, 2015, Adrianna elected a joint
    pension with a 60 percent survivor benefit. The pension payments to Adrianna then
    began. Once the payments started, the pension became what I will refer to as an
    “in-pay” pension. What I mean by this term is that “[p]ayment of the first instalment
    of the retired member’s pension was due on or before the family law valuation
    date”: <em>PBA</em>, s. 67.4(1)2.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Combined with additional bridging benefits that
    would end when Adrianna turned 65 years of age, she started receiving just
    under $5,000 per month in 2015.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Michael held various jobs over the years. Sadly,
    in April of 2016, shortly after Adrianna’s retirement, Michael fell seriously
    ill with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (“ALS”). At the time that he fell ill,
    he was working as a custodian with a school board. That work had to end when
    his illness set in. Michael’s motion record suggests that he soon began
    receiving “Ontario disability as his only source of income”, just under $1,000
    per month. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Just over a year later, on July 13, 2017, the
    parties separated. This was the agreed-upon “valuation date” for purposes of
    the <em>FLA</em>. At the time that he brought the motion, Michael acknowledged
    that Adrianna was also “voluntarily” giving him $300 per month.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her responding materials on the motion,
    Adrianna suggested that Michael was also receiving income from “charity
    donations from the community and from GoFundMe.com.” She maintained that she
    had assisted him in raising those funds. At the time of the motion, it appears that
    Michael was living in the matrimonial home and Adrianna was living elsewhere. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In April 2018, Michael applied to the court for
    a divorce, equalization of net family properties, spousal support, and exclusive
    possession of the matrimonial home, among other relief. Then, on May 24, 2019,
    he brought a motion to decide a question of law relating specifically to the
    division of Adrianna’s pension payments.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Separating spouses are strongly encouraged to resolve
    their family law disputes either entirely outside of court or with limited resort
    to the courts. Rule 16(12)(a) of the <em>FLR</em> permits the court, on motion,
    to “decide a question of law before trial, if the decision may dispose of all
    or part of the case, substantially shorten the trial or save substantial costs”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the Supreme Court of Canada recently
    emphasized in <em>Colucci v. Colucci</em>, 2021 SCC 24, at para. 69, “There is
    a trend in family law away from an adversarial culture of litigation to a
    culture of negotiation” (citations omitted). Recent amendments to both the <em>Divorce
    Act</em>, R.S.C., 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.) and the <em>FLA</em> require parties,
    to the extent that it is appropriate to do so, to try to resolve family law
    disputes outside the court structure through an alternative dispute resolution
    process, such as negotiation, mediation, or collaborative law: see <em>Divorce
    Act</em>, ss. 7.3, 7.7(2)(a), and 16.1(6); <em>FLA</em>, ss. 47.2(1),
    47.3(2)(a).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Rule 16(12)(a) of the <em>FLR</em> is a useful
    tool in this context. At the time of the motion, Adrianna’s pension had been
    valued for family law purposes. Following the procedures outlined in s. 67.2 of
    the <em>PBA</em>, which include actuarial assessments of each party’s life
    expectancy,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> the pension administrator determined that the imputed value of Adrianna’s pension
    for family law purposes was $1,281,826.54. Likewise, the pension administrator
    determined that the imputed value of Michael’s survivor benefit for family law
    purposes was $103,952.15. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The pension administrator also determined that,
    if the parties agreed to divide the pension at source for family law purposes,
    Michael was entitled to receive 48.99 percent of Adrianna’s monthly pension
    payments. This meant that Michael’s share of Adrianna’s pension, divided at
    source, would be $2,094.02 per month, with bridging benefits of an additional
    $294.36, which would continue until Adrianna turned 65 years of age. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was significant common ground between the
    parties. They were well-placed to settle most, if not all, of the issues
    arising from the breakdown of their marriage without a trial. There was, and
    still is, no dispute about the imputed pension values for family law purposes.
    There was, and still is, no dispute about the pension administrator’s
    calculation as it pertained to Michael’s share of Adrianna’s pension. There
    was, and still is, no dispute that the most valuable asset owned by the couple
    on the valuation date was Adrianna’s defined benefit pension with the OTPP.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[3]</span></span></span></a> There also was, and still is,
    no dispute that almost all of Adrianna’s pension was accumulated during the
    marriage, such that it would be included in Adrianna’s “net family property” as
    defined in s. 4(1) of the <em>FLA</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Consequently, had Michael’s equalization claim proceeded
    to trial, it appears that he would have been entitled to a substantial
    equalization payment pursuant to ss. 5(1) and 7(1) of the <em>FLA</em>. I will
    return to this concept shortly. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Instead, Michael’s notice of motion suggests
    that he wanted to divide Adrianna’s pension payments at source. Notably, this
    is an available option under s. 10.1(5) (order for division of pension payments),
    s. 56.1(3) (division of pension payments under a domestic contract), and s. 59.4.1(3)
    (division of pension payments pursuant to a family arbitration award) of the <em>FLA</em>,
    all of which explicitly provide for the division of pension payments where the
    pension is, as in this case, already in pay.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the parties differed on what should
    happen to Michael’s share of the divided pension payments following his death –
    which appeared to be imminent. Michael took the position that, if the pension
    payments were divided at source for family law purposes, then, after his death,
    his share of the pension could and should continue to his estate for the
    remainder of Adrianna’s lifetime. According to an affidavit filed in support of
    his motion, Michael took the position that any other approach would result in
    an “absurd” outcome, as it would fail to adequately respond to the “exercise”
    of attempting to equalize the “net family property in substance as well as
    form.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[4]</span></span></span></a> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Adrianna took the position that, if Michael
    predeceased her, the <em>PBA</em> precluded Michael’s share of the pension payments
    from continuing to his estate. Instead, Adrianna argued that, following
    Michael’s death, his share must revert back to her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given Michael’s very short life expectancy at
    the time that these discussions were taking place, Adrianna’s position meant
    that dividing the pension payments at source would almost certainly result in Michael
    receiving far less than he would have otherwise received if he had proceeded to
    trial for a determination of his <span style='color:black;background:white'>entitlement
    to equalization under s. 5(1) of the </span><em>FLA</em><span style='color:
black;background:white'>. I say this for the following reason.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section</span> 5(1) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>FLA</span></em><span

lang=EN-CA>Therefore, to place this issue in its proper context, assuming that
    there were no other significant assets beyond Adrianna’s pension and Michael’s
    survivor benefit in either party’s net family property, Adrianna would have
    owed Michael an equalization payment of around $590,000. </span></a><span
lang=EN-CA>I say this because, based on the pension administrator’s assigned
    values, the difference between the parties’ net family properties would be
    $1,177,874.39. Of course, Adrianna would owe half that amount to Michael if
    such an order had been made in accordance with the criteria set out in s. 9(1)
    of the <em>FLA</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To be very clear, I am not suggesting that the

    precision what that amount would have been. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>What we do know, however, is that Adrianna does
    not dispute that her pension would have been the most valuable asset to be
    factored into the equalization assessment, and that there were few other assets
    that would have played a role in arriving at the ultimate determination of how
    much she owed Michael. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Therefore, had Michael simply sought an equalization
    payment by way of a s. 7(1) application under the <em>FLA</em>, it would have
    come at a very high cost to Adrianna. Even on Adrianna’s own position, it seems
    clear that she would have owed Michael a large sum of money. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under s. 9(1)(a) of the <em>FLA</em>, the court
    may order one spouse to pay the other the full amount required to equalize
    their net family properties. Section 9(1)(c) permits the court to order that the
    amount or any part of the amount be paid in instalments, but only “if necessary
    to avoid hardship” and only over a maximum of 10 years. Therefore, where one
    party owes another an equalization payment of, say, $500,000, the court may
    order instalment payments under s. 9(1)(c), which could result in a payment
    exceeding $4,000 per month for 10 years.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Contrast that scenario with the potential
    pension division scenario for these parties where, based on the pension
    administrator’s undisputed calculations, Michael would have received a total monthly
    payment of just less than $2,400 per month (and less than that after Adrianna
    turned 65 years of age and the bridging benefits ended). Based upon this
    calculation, over the same 10-year period, well less than $300,000 would be
    paid. Of course, as will be further explained, if the pension division at
    source could continue to Michael’s estate, it would continue until the end of
    Adrianna’s life. On Michael’s calculations, if Adrianna lived for another 27
    years, which would put her at 86 years of age when she died, the amount paid
    through pension division at source would exceed $770,000, adjusted for
    increases on account of cost of living. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Michael saw the exercise of splitting the
    pension at source and having it continue to his estate as being based, as he
    put it in his motion materials, upon “the delivery of an equalization payment.”
    The difficulty for Michael was that the OTPP, in correspondence sent to his
    lawyer, took the position that the payments could only continue to his estate
    if there was a settlement instrument directing the OTPP to do so: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Please note that unless the settlement
    instrument which provides for the pension division specifically requires that
    the split continue to the former spouse’s Estate should he predecease the

    resolve this matter. The OTPP was prepared to have the split continue to his
    estate, but Michael needed a “settlement instrument” directing the OTPP
    accordingly. Contrary to Michael and the OTPP, Adrianna took the position that
    the <em>PBA</em> precluded what Michael contemplated would be a means of
    achieving some form of equalization. Accordingly, Michael brought a Rule
    16(12)(a) motion under the <em>FLR</em>.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge began by pointing to s. 10.1(7)
    of the <em>FLA</em> to suggest that, if the<i> <em>PBA</em></i> applies to the
    pension plan, which it does in this case, then the restrictions under s. 67.4
    of the <em>PBA</em> “apply with respect to the division of the spouse’s
    interest in the plan” by an order under s. 9 of the <em>FLA</em>. This was the
    only reference that the motion judge made to the <em>FLA</em>.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge referred to s. 67.5(1) of the <em>PBA</em>,

    is not effective to the extent that it purports to require the administrator of
    a pension plan to divide the pension benefits” in relation to an in-pay
    pension, other than in accordance with s. 67.4.</span></p>

    situations where the pension is in pay “before the family law valuation date.” As
    before, the pension payments in this case started after Adrianna’s retirement on
    June 30, 2015, and the family law valuation date was not until July 13, 2017. As
    correctly observed by the motion judge, this brought the pension payments in
    question squarely under s. 67.4 of the <em>PBA</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Focusing upon s. 67.4, the motion judge noted
    that, in his view, nothing in the provision allows for the payment of a pension
    divided at source to continue to a non-member spouse’s estate where the
    non-member spouse dies first. Rather, the motion judge emphasized that s. 67.4
    directs that the proportion of the retired member spouse’s pension is to be
    paid to the “eligible spouse”, not the deceased eligible spouse’s estate. </span></p>

    payments to the [non-member] spouse” would “end … on his or her death” (per s.
    44(3.1)). This latter interpretation was based upon a finding that the
    statutory reference was to a “surviving spouse” and not to the estate of the surviving
    spouse: “Again, the reference is to payments to the ‘surviving spouse’ without
    any mention or suggestion that these payments are to be paid to the estate of
    the surviving spouse.” </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, the motion judge concluded that continuing
    payments to a non-member spouse’s estate “until the death of the pension
    holder” (the situation for which Michael was advocating) would contravene s.
    44(3.1) because it would cause Adrianna to receive a pension payment of less
    than 60 percent of the total monthly payment. The motion judge reasoned that Michael’s
    request for the pension sharing to continue to his estate had to be denied
    because, if his estate continued to receive 48.99 percent of the monthly
    payment owed under the pension, then Adrianna would only be receiving 51.01
    percent after his death, which is clearly less than the minimum “60 per cent”
    that the motion judge saw as required pursuant to s. 44(3.1) of the <em>PBA</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the motion judge pointed out that there
    is no statutory means by which the former spouse could bequeath or share their
    portion of the monthly payments of the pension. Indeed, as the motion judge
    noted, this is specifically prohibited under s. 65(1) of the <em>PBA</em>:
    “Every transaction that purports to assign, charge, anticipate or give as
    security money payable under a pension plan is void.”</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant argues that the motion
    judge erred by concluding that the pension payments could not continue to be
    shared after Michael’s death, with Michael’s portion being paid to his estate for
    the remainder of Adrianna’s lifetime. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, and in the alternative, the appellant
    argues that the motion judge erred by ordering retroactive sharing of the
    monthly pension amounts. The appellant maintains that Michael did not ask for
    this on the motion. Instead, if he was unsuccessful on issue one, it was his
    intent to proceed to a s. 7(1) <em>FLA</em> application, seeking an
    equalization payment from Adrianna. Pursuant to s. 7(2)(a) of the <em>FLA</em>,
    an equalization application commenced before death can be continued by the estate.
    Michael’s application was commenced before death. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the first issue, the respondent argues that
    the motion judge was right to conclude that the <em>PBA</em> precludes pension
    sharing to the estate of a deceased spouse. On the second issue, the respondent
    disputes the appellant’s version of events. She maintains that Michael’s
    counsel, during oral submissions at the motion, asked for the remedy ultimately
    granted by the motion judge as an alternative to his main request for relief. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    this matter on the basis of the first issue. In my view, there is nothing in
    the <em>PBA</em> that precludes pension payments divided at source from
    continuing to the estate of a non-member spouse during the life of the member
    spouse, in the event that the non-member spouse predeceases the member spouse. Having
    resolved the narrow legal question that was properly before the motion judge, I
    would decline to address the second issue, and instead turn the matter back to
    the parties to determine how to proceed from here: either through pension
    division at source to Michael’s estate or through an equalization payment.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant argues that the motion
    judge erred by failing to advert to s. 39(2) of the Regulation, which is said
    to provide a full answer on appeal. That provision reads:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>The eligible spouse’s

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the appellant argues that the motion
    judge considered statutory provisions that were wholly irrelevant to the issue
    at hand. In particular, the motion judge is said to have erred by looking to s.
    44(3.1) of the <em>PBA</em> when determining whether a non-member spouse’s
    share of the pension payments could be paid into their estate after death. The
    appellant argues that this provision does nothing more than create minimum
    standards for pension plans that are irrelevant to the question of how pension payments
    can be divided for family law purposes, either through a domestic contract,
    family arbitration award, or court order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the appellant points out that s. 65(3)5.
    of the <em>PBA</em> specifically precluded the motion judge from relying on s.
    65(1) of the <em>PBA</em>, which does not “apply to prevent the assignment, by
    an order under the <em>Family Law Act</em> … of an interest in money payable

lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Like the motion judge, Adrianna emphasizes that the
    “not … less than 60 per cent” requirement in s. 44(3.1) of the <em>PBA</em> precludes
    the appellant’s requested relief. While parties can waive the joint and
    survivorship provisions of the pension pursuant to s. 46(1) of the <em>PBA</em>,
    Michael and Adrianna took no steps to do so. As a result, since s. 44 of the <em>PBA</em> sets out the parameters for joint and survivor pensions, Michael’s estate is
    precluded from continuing to receive the 48.99 percent of Adrianna’s pension after
    his death because it would force her payments below the statutory minimum of 60
    percent.</span></p>

    does not assist the appellant because it does not specifically authorize a
    share of the payments of a retired member spouse’s pension to be made to the
    estate of the non-member deceased spouse. Read in context, Adrianna argues that
    the use of the term “eligible spouse” in s. 39(2) of the Regulation confers
    rights only on a living person and not on an estate.</span></p>

    otherwise prescribed.” Had the legislature intended for payment sharing in
    relation to in-pay pensions to potentially continue to an estate under s. 67.4,
    the legislature would have included a similar provision. The silence of s. 67.4

    has not precluded the possibility that pension payments which are divided at
    source for family law purposes may continue to the non-member spouse’s estate
    for the balance of the member spouse’s life in the event that the non-member
    spouse predeceases the member spouse. Said differently, parties can agree, a
    court can order, or an arbitrator can award that the sharing of pension
    payments at source shall continue to the non-member spouse’s estate after that

    virtue of a special definition given to the term “spouse” for the specific purpose
    of those provisions. Immediately under the heading “Family Law Matters”, s. 67.1(2)

    67.3(1) permits a former spouse to apply for an “immediate transfer of a lump
    sum from the plan” if various criteria are met, the second of which states that
    “[n]o payment of an instalment of the member’s or former member’s pension was

    permits the transfer of a lump sum for family law purposes directly from one
    spouse’s pension to another specified location involving enforced savings
    requirements: to another pension plan, to a prescribed retirement savings
    arrangement, or to another prescribed arrangement, or by leaving it in the pension
    plan to the credit of the eligible spouse.&nbsp;In this way, s. 67.3(2) places specific
    limits on the structure of lump sum transfers from pensions that were not in

    (5) combine to allow a lump sum which is destined for one of the specified
    locations to be redirected to an estate, should the non-member spouse die
    before the transfer takes place. Sections 67.3(4) and (5) read: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(4) Once the application is complete, the
    administrator shall make the transfer within the prescribed period. </span></p>

    sum made payable under s. 67.3(2) has not been transferred “before the death of
    the eligible spouse”, then that sum will instead be made payable to the
    eligible spouse’s estate. Considering the statutory constraints placed upon
    where the lump sum amount can be directed pursuant to s. 67.3(2), it makes sense
    that the statute specifically addresses what happens to that amount should the death
    of the non-member spouse intervene. </span></p>

    directed to enforced savings accounts. Section 67.4(2) of the <em>PBA</em>, governing
    in-pay pensions, operates in a much simpler manner: the eligible spouse may
    apply “to the administrator of the plan for division of the retired member’s
    pension and for payment of the eligible spouse’s share to him or her.”</span></p>

    full pension amount (as 51.01 is less than 60). But that is not the effect of
    this section. Instead, s. 44(3.1) regulates the benefits that must be provided

    become joint and survivor will not, upon the death of their spouse, receive a
    pension payment that is less than 60% of the payment they were receiving during
    the life of their spouse. That is, it requires “the pension payable to the

    of an eligible spouse’s share of an in-pay divided pension – precisely the type
    of payments at the heart of this dispute – as “payable for the life of the

    specifically states that the eligible spouse’s “share of the retired member’s

    in the Regulation that precludes that outcome from occurring. Importantly, the

  <p class=CQuote><b><span lang=EN-CA>A902.</span></b><span lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;The&nbsp;Ontario
    Pension Benefits Act (PBA) does not address this issue. In the absence of a PBA

    it is that letter that caused Michael to bring his motion in the first place. </span></p>

    administrator wrote a letter to Michael’s lawyer, stating that pension division
    could only continue to his estate if a settlement instrument provided for it.
    The letter reads in part as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Our member commenced her pension prior to the
    Family Law Valuation Date. Accordingly, the only option for division with her
    former spouse is a pension split, assuming that the parties wish to utilize the
    pension to satisfy equalization or support obligations. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The amount that is to be paid to the former
    spouse will be a deduction to the member’s pension. The member will lose that
    portion of her pension for so long as the split is required to be paid.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Please note that <span class=Underline>unless
    the settlement instrument which provides for the pension division specifically
    requires that the split continue to the former spouse’s Estate should he
    predecease the member, on his death the portion being paid to him reverts to
    the member</span>. Of course, if the member predeceases her former spouse, the
    pension ceases and accordingly the pension split ceases as well. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    Both suggest that, while the retired member spouse is alive, the estate of the
    former spouse of the retired member is not precluded from receiving a share of
    the retired member’s pension for the balance of the retired member’s life. While
    not determinative, it is still noteworthy that neither FSCO nor the OTPP

    particularly true in situations like this one where, from an actuarial

    separate and there is no reasonable prospect of resuming cohabitation, “the
    spouse whose net family property is the lesser of the two net family properties
    is entitled to one-half the difference between them.” Section 9(1)(a) of the <em>FLA</em> allows the court to order one spouse to pay the other the amount to which that
    spouse is entitled under the equalization regime. The idea here is that the
    value of property accumulated during the marriage partnership, in which spouses
    are assumed to have been equal partners, should be shared equally when that
    marriage ends. This includes the accumulation of a pension over the course of a
    marriage. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>It is true that pensions have been referred to as “sometimes elusive

    of income, rather than a current and exigible fund”: Kendra D.M.G. Coats <i>et
    al.</i>, <em>Ontario Family Law Practice 2020</em>, Volume 2 (Toronto:
    LexisNexis Canada, 2019), at p. 537. It is because of the elusive nature of the
    pension that a new regime was introduced in 2009 to address these difficult
    issues. At the same time, the<i> <em>FLA</em></i> was amended so that the
    family law value of an Ontario-regulated pension would be determined by the
    pension administrator pursuant to a formula set out in the regulations to the <em>PBA</em>:
    see <em>FLA</em>, ss. 4(1)(c), 10.1; <em>PBA</em>, s. 67.2. Section 67.2(1)
    reads: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The preliminary value of a member’s pension
    benefits, a former member’s deferred pension or a retired member’s pension
    under a pension plan, before apportionment for family law purposes, is
    determined by the administrator in accordance with the regulations and as of
    the family law valuation date of the member, former member or retired member
    and his or her spouse. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Adrianna’s argument on appeal relies heavily on the sense that a
    pension payment, by its very nature, does not continue after death. This is of
    course true. Adrianna’s pension payments would and could continue only for her
    lifetime. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'><span lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>But what is at issue on this appeal was never
    the duration of the pension payments to Adrianna. They will certainly stop upon
    her death. Instead, what is at issue on appeal is whether, given Michael’s
    entitlement under s. 5(1) of the <em>FLA</em> to one half the difference
    between his and Adrianna’s net family properties, the division of pension
    payments at source for family law purposes could instead continue to Michael’s
    estate for the balance of Adrianna’s life. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Of course, as with all actuarial calculations, there is an element
    of risk. To divide an in-pay pension at source could ultimately be either more
    or less lucrative than a single payment pursuant to s. 9(1)(a) of the <em>FLA</em>.
    If the pension member spouse lived a long life, theoretically, the total value
    of the payments to the estate may exceed what would have been received through an
    equalization payment under the <em>FLA</em>. But, if the pension member spouse experiences
    an untimely passing, the value of the divided pension payments to the estate may
    result in a total value far less than what would have been received through
    equalization under the <em>FLA</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As part of the policy to encourage out-of-court settlement of family
    law disputes, it is important that the option for pension sharing to continue
    to the estate – acknowledged by the OTPP and FSCO – remains available. There
    are many scenarios where such an option would clearly financially benefit both
    sides, thereby facilitating resolution. Viewed as a means by which to avoid
    placing a pension-holder in the difficult position of owing money to which they
    do not at the time have access, the sharing of pension payments at source for
    the continuation of the retired member’s life, which in no way is precluded by
    the relevant statutes or regulation, makes both conceptual and practical sense. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, contrary to the decision appealed from, nothing in the <em>PBA</em> or the Regulation prohibits division of pension payments for family law

    that pension valued for family law purposes. Even so, a February 14, 2019 letter
    from the Ford Motor Company suggests that at the “normal retirement date of May
