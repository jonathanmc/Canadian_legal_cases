lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent was convicted of two counts of
    procuring a prostitute under age 18, contrary to s. 286.3(2) and two counts of
    making child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(2) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.
    Convictions under s. 286.3(2) carry a mandatory minimum of five years
    imprisonment.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent challenged the constitutionality
    of the mandatory minimum, alleging it amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.
    On July 20, 2018, the trial judge held the section contravened s. 12 and was of
    no force and effect: <em>R. v. Safieh</em>, 2018 ONSC 4468.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the respondent was not sentenced on
    that date, the Crown immediately purported to appeal “the sentence imposed”,
    seeking an order setting aside the declaration of invalidity. The Crown filed a
    factum shortly thereafter, seeking the same relief. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown appeal and an appeal brought by the respondent
    from the convictions (C66003) did not come before the court until September
    2021. The Crown continued to rely on the Notice of Appeal filed in July 2018
    and the factum filed shortly thereafter. That material sought only an order
    setting aside the trial judge’s declaration of invalidity. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>A Preliminary Point</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s Notice of Appeal and factum do not
    ask the court to vary the sentence imposed. Indeed, they could not have sought
    that relief, as both were filed long before any sentence was imposed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown appears to have been under the misapprehension
    that it had a right of appeal under Part XXI of the <em>Criminal Code</em> from
    the finding that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional. The Crown
    has no such right of appeal. The Crown’s right of appeal is from the sentence imposed
    and not from any ruling that may have been made in the course of the sentencing
    proceedings: <em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 687.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Notice of Appeal filed in the summer of 2018
    was a nullity. The Crown’s right to seek leave to appeal the sentence imposed
    at trial crystallized only when the sentence was imposed in January 2019. After
    the sentence was imposed, the Crown should have filed a proper Notice of Appeal
    and factum, setting out the arguments in support of the constitutionality of
    the mandatory minimum and the variation sought by the Crown in the sentences
    imposed by the trial judge in January 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the appeal was not properly commenced
    and a new Notice of appeal and factum should have been filed after sentencing,
    we are satisfied the respondent was not prejudiced. The appellant had timely
    notice of the Crown’s intention to challenge the trial judge’s ruling on the
    constitutionality of the mandatory minimum. The Crown has also made it clear that
    it does not seek to increase the total sentence imposed on the respondent at
    trial. The Crown seeks, first and foremost, a determination by this court that
    the mandatory minimum is constitutional. The Crown also seeks a reconfiguring
    of the sentences imposed at trial to give effect to the five-year mandatory
    minimum required under s. 286.3(2). To achieve that end, the Crown proposed
    concurrent five-year sentences on each of the procuring charges, a consecutive
    sentence of one year on one of the making child pornography charges, and a
    further concurrent sentence of one year on the other making child pornography
    charge. This reconfiguration would produce the same total sentence as was
    imposed by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Merits</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is unnecessary to set out the facts of the
    case. Those facts can be found in the trial judge’s ruling on the
    constitutionality of s. 286.3(2) (<em>R. v. Safieh</em>, 2018 ONSC 4486 and his
    reasons for sentence (<em>R. v. Safieh</em>, 2019 ONSC 287).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge followed the s. 12 methodology
    laid down in <em>R. v. Nur</em>, 2015 SCC 15, at para. 46, and recently applied
    in <em>R. v. Morrison</em>, 2019 SCC 15, at paras. 143-54. No one argued the
    mandatory minimum was unconstitutional, as applied to the respondent. The
    constitutional arguments focused on the reasonable hypotheticals presented to
    the trial judge. The Crown agreed that the hypotheticals were properly
    considered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In finding the section unconstitutional, the
    trial judge focused on the second hypothetical:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>After having begun negotiating with a pimp via
    text messaging in order to work for him so she can pay off her drug debts, an
    18-year-old prostitute, at the behest of her pimp, approaches her 17-year-old
    friend to see if she also wants to act as a prostitute for the pimp. The older
    girl is aware that the younger girl also has drug debts of her own. The younger
    girl jumps at the opportunity. The 18-year-old then brings the 17-year-old girl
    along with her for a face-to-face meeting with the pimp with the knowledge that
    the purpose of the meeting is for the pimp to continue recruiting herself and
    to recruit the 17-year-old. During the meeting, the pimp addresses the nature
    of the working relationship he will have with both girls. The pimp himself has
    no direct contact with the 17-year-old until they actually meet in person. As
    such, the 18-year-old directly assisted the pimp in recruiting the 17-year-old.
    The 18-year-old prostitute expects no financial gain or any other benefit from
    bringing the younger girl to the meeting. The 18-year-old prostitute is the
    product of the group home system and has been manipulated, exploited and
    prostituted by a pimp when she was a minor.</span></p>

    considered, having regard to the applicable principles of sentencing, but
    excluding the mandatory five-year minimum, the appropriate sentencing range for
    the offender described in the hypothetical: <em>Nur</em>, at para. 46. The trial
    judge acknowledged that the offence, as described in the hypothetical, remained
    a serious offence for which denunciation and general deterrence were primary
    considerations. The trial judge further held, however, that on the facts of the
    hypothetical, the offender’s moral culpability was substantially reduced. He
    said, at para. 46:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>While the court must still recognize that the
    principal factors to consider on sentencing are denunciation and general
    deterrence, the circumstances in a case like <em>Robataille</em> would in my
    view constitute exceptional circumstances … and would serve to reduce the
    appropriate sentence to well below the normal range. The failure to take these special
    circumstances into account would serve only to revictimize the offender and
    punish her based on her prior sexual abuse as a child. </span></p>

    sentence for the hypothetical offender was between 2 and 2 ½ years. The trial
    judge recognized that the mandatory minimum sentence of five years amounted to
    cruel and unusual punishment only if a five-year sentence was grossly
    disproportionate to the sentence that would have been imposed on the
    hypothetical offender, but for the mandatory minimum. Although the concept of gross
    disproportionality is probably incapable of precise definition, there can be no
    doubt that it describes a high threshold. Sentences which are sufficiently
    excessive to merit appellate intervention are not necessarily grossly
    disproportionate for the purposes of s. 12 of the <em>Charter</em>: <em>Nur</em>,
    at para. 39. The trial judge was satisfied that a sentence of five years
    imposed on a person for whom two years would have been an appropriate sentence,
    crossed over the grossly disproportionate threshold:  Reasons, at para. 47.</span></p>

    procuring offence in this case is more serious than the receiving of a benefit
    offence described in s. 286.2(2), the offences are closely related and raise
    very similar reasonable hypotheticals for consideration. The “victim/offender”

    opposed to a sentence of something less than two years, would have been an
    appropriate sentence for the offender described in the hypothetical, we agree
    that a sentence of five years – two and one-half times the length of the
    appropriate sentence – would be grossly disproportionate. We note that although
    the Crown argued in her factum that a sentence of five years would not
    necessarily be grossly disproportionate, she did not pursue that argument in
