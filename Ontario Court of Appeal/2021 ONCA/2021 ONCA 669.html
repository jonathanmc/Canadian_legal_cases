  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals from the dismissal of her
    motion (the “Motion”), in which she sought an order dismissing, on
    jurisdictional grounds, the respondent’s application for relief arising from
    the breakdown of their marriage (the “Application”). Before the motion judge,
    the appellant argued: i) that Ontario lacked jurisdiction to hear the
    Application and ii) in the alternative, that the city of Kunming, in the
    province of Yunnan, People’s Republic of China was the more appropriate forum
    for the dispute. The motion judge rejected both arguments, concluding that Ontario
    had jurisdiction and that the appellant had not met her burden of showing that
    China was the “clearly more appropriate” forum for the case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would not
    interfere with the motion judge’s finding that Ontario has jurisdiction to hear
    the dispute. However, I conclude that the motion judge erred in reaching the
    conclusion that China was not the “clearly more appropriate” forum for
    resolving the respondent’s property and support claims. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At its core, this litigation relates to assets
    located in China and the respondent’s post-separation interest in them, if any.
    The respondent purportedly waived his interest in the assets by entering into
    three written agreements in China. These agreements have not been set aside.
    Since these documents were executed and witnessed in China, the Chinese courts
    are in a far better position to deal with their applicability. Respectfully,
    the motion judge ignored this very important factor in analyzing the doctrine
    of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Instead, the motion judge focused on the fact that the respondent was pursuing
    a trust claim interest in a single property in Ontario: a property worth a
    small fraction of the appellant’s overall assets. In my view, the failure to
    consider the parties’ domestic agreements as central to the </span><em>forum non conveniens</em><span
lang=EN-CA> analysis was an error in principle justifying intervention by this
    court.</span></p>

    2019. This status was not renewed. The respondent is a Canadian citizen.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant provided evidence during the Motion
    demonstrating that, between the date of marriage in 2012 and the date of
    divorce in 2018 (approximately 6 years), she was in Canada for a total of approximately
    300 days (less than 10 months in total). She conceded during questioning that
    some visits to Toronto, Ontario in 2015 may not have appeared in the evidence
    filed by the parties.</span></p>

    separation. The appellant claims that the parties separated in April 2016,
    after a physical altercation in their home. For his part, the respondent claims
    that the parties continued to reside together as a couple both in China and
    Toronto until at least March 2018.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In March 2018, the parties obtained a divorce
    certificate in China. As discussed in further detail below, the respondent
    disputes the validity of this divorce.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent claims that he and the appellant
    contributed work and resources to a series of family companies that are located
    in China. He suggests that the appellant leveraged assets from certain family
    businesses to borrow funds to purchase real estate in her name alone.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant states that she owned corporations

lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent claims that the parties shared
    two matrimonial homes located in Toronto. In 2012, just prior to the marriage,
    the appellant purchased a property at 220 Elmwood Avenue (the “Elmwood
    Property”), in her name alone. She claims that she purchased the Elmwood
    Property for her son to reside in while he attended school in Canada. In May
    2016, the Elmwood Property was sold, and the proceeds were used to purchase
    property at 33 Bevdale Road, Toronto (the “Bevdale Property”), also in the
    appellant’s name alone. The respondent claims he found the Bevdale Property and
    worked with a real estate agent to arrange the purchase. He states that the
    parties were not separated at this time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant has a Royal Bank of Canada account
    in Toronto, in her name alone, which she used to pay the expenses for the Elmwood
    and Bevdale Properties. The respondent argues that he made contributions to
    this account that were used to pay for the mortgage, taxes, utilities, and
    other expenses for the Bevdale Property.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 11, 2014, the parties signed a Marital
    Assets Agreement addressing five Chinese properties the appellant purchased in
    her name alone. This Agreement confirms that the respondent has no entitlements
    to the properties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 12, 2015, the respondent also signed a
    Letter of Commitment clarifying that he lacked any interest in 41 specified
    investment properties. These properties are all located in China.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2019, after the divorce, the parties

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:

    the respondent, his mother, sister, and brother-in-law. The repayment amount is
    6,000,000 RMB, which the appellant claims includes interest and an “equitable
    voluntary payment” by her to the respondent, representing his “monetary
    interest” in their relationship. The respondent argues that the repayment
    agreement is unrelated to any division of marital property. The Marital Assets
    Agreement, Letter of Commitment, and loan repayment agreement were all executed
    and witnessed in China, in the Chinese language and in Chinese currency.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Divorce Agreement and the Supplementary

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 26, 2018, the parties applied for a
    divorce in Kunming. They attended together at the Kunming City Ministry of
    Civil Affairs Marriage Registry and brought a handwritten document stating
    their intention to divorce as well as their agreement that i) there will be no
    disputes in relation to the children and ii)&nbsp;all issues related to
    property, debts, and liabilities had been resolved through private negotiation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The registrar required a typed document, so the
    respondent typed a document with the same terms as the handwritten document
    (the “Divorce Agreement”). Both parties signed the document, added their
    fingerprints, and obtained a divorce certificate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claims this divorce certificate is
    valid and reflects the parties’ agreement. The respondent states that the
    appellant misled him, assuring him that this was not a real divorce.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant states that on March 26, 2018, the
    parties signed a Supplementary Agreement to the Divorce Agreement. In this
    document, the respondent waived his rights to any of the appellant’s assets. It
    states that all property in either party’s name belongs to the appellant, except
    for a car and a debt owing by the respondent, which he would retain.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the Supplementary
    Agreement reflects the parties’ negotiations and the fact that the respondent
    made no contributions to her corporations or real estate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent asserts that he does not recall
    executing the Supplementary Agreement. He claims he was unaware of the
    Supplementary Agreement’s existence until December 2019. He admits that the
    signature on the document resembles his but claims the appellant would ask him
    to sign blank documents in case his signature was needed while he was absent.
    The respondent contests the validity of the divorce obtained in China as well
    as the Supplementary Agreement.</span></p>

    Application for various relief, including: i) a declaration that the Chinese
    divorce not be recognized or enforced in Ontario; ii) a declaration setting
    aside the Supplementary Agreement; and iii) a declaration that Ontario has
    jurisdiction to determine the outstanding property and support issues between
    the parties. The outstanding property and support issues included claims for
    equalization, spousal support, and the respondent’s claim of a resulting and/or
    constructive trust over the Bevdale Property, based on the allegation that the
    appellant was unjustly enriched by his contributions to the Bevdale Property. </span></p>

    outstanding issues between the parties arising from the breakdown of their

    determine the validity of the Chinese divorce. She acknowledged that there is a
    presumption in favour of recognizing the validity of foreign divorces, and that
    it is rare for a Canadian court to refuse to recognize a divorce properly
    obtained under the laws of another jurisdiction. While the divorce’s validity
    would impact the respondent’s spousal support claim, it would not impact the
    equalization and trust claims made under s.&nbsp;15 of the <em>Family Law Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (“<em>FLA</em>”), which the motion judge
    considered next. In considering these claims, the motion judge recognized that,
    absent a statutory rule, an Ontario court may take jurisdiction </span><span lang=EN-CA><em>simpliciter</em></span><span

    the forum and the subject matter or the parties to the dispute: <em>Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda</em>, 2012 SCC 17, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 572.</span></p>

    and that his affidavit did not establish that he lived in Canada. She, on the
    other hand, does not live in or carry on business in Ontario; the appellant’s
    business is “based entirely in China”, and the respondent’s employment and
    business activities during the “material times” were entirely in China.
    Furthermore, the appellant argues that her only connection to Ontario is a
    single encumbered piece of real property (the Bevdale Property) and a bank

    “shred” of evidence that the respondent lived primarily in Canada. The
    respondent presented proof of Canadian citizenship and the respondent’s
    passport and driver’s licence all indicated that he lived at the Elmwood and
    Bevdale Properties. Furthermore, there was evidence before the motion judge
    that he made payments towards the carrying costs of maintaining the properties

    D.L.R. (4th) 452, this court accepted that in the context of marriage breakdown
    the presumptive connecting factors are necessarily different from those
    identified in <em>Van Breda</em>, which was a tort case. This court noted that
    the list of presumptive connecting factors is not closed and the location of
    the “real home” or “ordinary residence” should be a presumptive connecting
    factor: </span><span lang=EN-CA><em>Wang</em></span><em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To this end, under Ontario law, there is a high
    bar to set aside a domestic contract that complies with the enforceability
    requirements of s. 55(1) of the <em>FLA</em>: namely, that it is made in
    writing, signed by the parties and witnessed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, to proceed with his claims for
    equalization or an interest in the properties covered by the agreements, the
    respondent would first have to seek to set those agreements aside. The
    respondent would also have to address the appellant’s position that there was a
    loan repayment agreement executed in 2019 that settled some of the matrimonial
    claims. In Ontario, of course, a claim for equalization or support under the </span><span><em>FLA</em></span><span lang=EN-CA> would engage the factors set out at s.&nbsp;56(4) of the Act for setting aside
    a domestic agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 56(4) of the </span><span><em>FLA</em></span><span lang=EN-CA> provides that,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A court may, on application, set aside a
    domestic contract or a provision in it,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(a) if a party failed to disclose to the other
    significant assets, or significant debts or other liabilities, existing when

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was also evidence before the motion judge
    that similar provisions exist in China to set aside unfair contracts. The
    opinion letter tendered by the appellant on the Motion states that, according
    to Article 54 of the Contract Law of People’s Republic of China, a valid
    contract can be set aside where there is a significant misunderstanding, or
    when one party uses fraudulent or coercive means or takes advantage of the
    other party while they are in a vulnerable state, not unlike Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this way, the preliminary question of whether
    the agreements could be set aside, was in my view central to assessing the more
    appropriate forum. Respectfully, the motion judge erred in considering the
    respondent’s claims in the Bevdale Property – and his potential entitlements to
    share in some way (whether by way of equalization or a direct property
    interest) in the appellant’s Chinese properties – without considering the
    question of setting aside the divorce and/or the agreements about property. With
    the agreements as the proper focus, and given that the agreements were all
    executed and witnessed in China, in the Chinese language, it becomes clear that
    China is the most appropriate forum for the dispute.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the motion judge’s reasons state that
    the natural forum for the claim to the Bevdale Property is here in Ontario. As
    set out above, the location of the property is a factor that carries
    considerable weight on the jurisdiction inquiry. However, the motion judge’s
    focus on the Bevdale Property overwhelmed her analysis of </span><em>forum non conveniens</em><span
lang=EN-CA>. In this case, the far more valuable property interests are in
    China and are governed by contracts in China; there are multiple agreements
    between the parties that are, as mentioned, written in the Chinese language and
    in Chinese currency. These agreements concern multi-million-dollar business
    interests and properties there. In contrast, the Bevdale Property is worth
    considerably less. The Bevdale Property should not have been the focal point of
    the analysis and it certainly was not the natural forum for the division of
    property claim viewed as a whole.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the motion judge held that the respondent
    was not claiming any property interest in properties or corporations located in
    China, only in the monetary payment that would occur after the equalization
    calculation based on properties or corporations in China. However, this factor
    assumes that an equalization payment would be the only remedy under Chinese
    law. There was no evidence that equalization rather than distribution of
    properties would be the remedy in China and the motion judge engaged in
    speculation that this would be the case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the motion judge erred in her analysis
    in terms of the respondent’s loss of a legitimate juridical advantage. The motion
    judge identified the juridical advantage as the respondent’s ability to pursue
    his claim for property division in Ontario because he may be out of time in
    China. On the Motion, the respondent produced an opinion from a lawyer stating
    that, in China, where a man and woman are divorced by joint divorce and the
    parties have a change of mind over the issue of property division, they have
    one year from the date of the divorce to request to modify or revoke the
    property division agreement. The respondent’s legal opinion concludes that,
    based on this rule, litigation concerning division of property by joint divorce
    needs to be filed within one year.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For her part, the appellant disagreed that the
    respondent was out of time in China. She also produced an expert opinion that
    stated that the respondent could seek redress in a Chinese court to amend or
    void the Supplementary Agreement if he could demonstrate that he was under a
    serious misunderstanding, or there was an appearance of unfairness, or that he
    was defrauded, coerced or taken advantage of while in a vulnerable state that
    caused him to erroneously express his intention. Faced with this conflicting
    evidence, the motion judge nevertheless held that if Ontario declined
    jurisdiction, the respondent could lose a legitimate juridical advantage
    because he was out of time in China.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that there is some support for the
    respondent’s position that an expired limitation period in the other
    jurisdiction would make Ontario the more juridically advantageous forum for him
    as plaintiff, and that a juridical advantage to a plaintiff in Ontario weighs
    against staying the proceedings: see </span><span
lang=EN-CA><em>Garcia v. Tahoe Resources Inc.</em></span><span lang=EN-CA>, 2017
    BCCA 39, 407 D.L.R. (4th) 651, at para. 91, leave to appeal refused, [2017]
    S.C.C.A. No. 94.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, some courts have ruled that the
    plaintiff’s failure to bring a claim within the time limit “militates against
    attaching any weight to the juridical advantage factor because, in some
    circumstances, a plaintiff could successfully oppose a defendant’s </span><em>forum non conveniens</em><span
lang=EN-CA> application in one jurisdiction by simply allowing the limitation
    period to expire in the other jurisdiction”: </span><span lang=EN-CA><em>Tahoe</em></span><span lang=EN-CA>,
    at para. 91. It seems, then, that “the weight attached to the juridical
    advantage factor when considering the expiration of a limitation period in
    another jurisdiction is a case-specific inquiry that turns on the facts”: </span><span lang=EN-CA><em>Tahoe</em></span><span lang=EN-CA>,
    at para. 92.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the motion judge held that the limitation
    period weighed in the respondent’s favour. There was no case-specific inquiry in
    reaching that conclusion. As noted, this case involves the <span
class=Underline>potential</span> expiry of a limitation period; the
    respondent’s evidence on this point does not lead to this conclusion with any
    certainty. The motion judge did not resolve an inconsistency between the facts
    of the case and the facts relied upon by the respondent’s expert opinion. The
    opinion regarding the one-year time limit concerned parties who “change their
    mind” over property division. The respondent’s evidence, however, was that he
    was misled in terms of the Divorce Agreement and was not aware of the existence
    of a Supplementary Agreement. He did not argue that he had changed his mind
    about the agreements. On that evidence, it becomes less clear that the
    respondent is, in fact, out of time in China.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the respondent testified during
    questioning that he has never thought of going to court in China to deal with
    property division. This fact does not help the respondent claim the juridical
    advantage of an Ontario action: see </span><span
lang=EN-CA><em>Hurst&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Société Nationale de L'Amiante</em></span><span
lang=EN-CA>, 2008 ONCA 573, 93 O.R. (3d) 338, at paras. 51-52. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In summary, the motion judge erred in principle
    in her analysis under <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In my view, the appellant has
    demonstrated that the balance tips heavily in favour of China as the “clearly
    more appropriate” forum for resolving the parties’ property issues and the
    motion judge should have declined to exercise jurisdiction. Accordingly, I
    would allow this ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Should this court strike out all or part of the
    respondent’s Application, leaving only the trust claims concerning the Bevdale
    Property to proceed in Ontario?</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argued that this court should
    consider severing the respondent’s trust claim over the Bevdale Property,
    allowing it to proceed in Ontario while striking the remainder of the claims.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I have already decided that China is the more
    appropriate forum to hear the claims arising from the parties’ marital
    breakdown, this issue is now moot.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, I do make the following observations.
    Severing the specific claims in relation to the Bevdale Property appears to be
    contrary to some of the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada as
    relevant to the <em>forum
    non conveniens</em> analysis in </span><span lang=EN-CA><em>Van Breda</em></span><span
lang=EN-CA>, at paras. 105, 110, including a desire to avoid a multiplicity of
    legal proceedings and avoiding conflicting decisions in different courts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Severance of the trust claim is also potentially
    problematic because this court has made clear that claims of unjust enrichment
    are rarely appropriate to address financial issues after the breakdown of a
    marriage and a court would, in all likelihood, find that equalization of all
    net family properties under the legislation would provide a full remedy to any
    unfairness that would otherwise arise from different contributions to family
    assets: </span><span lang=EN-CA><em>McNamee v.
