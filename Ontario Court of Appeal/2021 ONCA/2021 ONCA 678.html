  <p><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Zarnett

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>INTRODUCTION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 3, 2012, the appellant participated, with
    others, in an armed robbery at a car dealership. The appellant was carrying a gun.
    He used it to shoot an employee of the dealership, whom he had also punched and
    struck in the head with a hard object while demanding money and drugs, and from
    whom he stole cash and other belongings. A customer of the dealership was also assaulted
    by one of the appellant’s accomplices.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge convicted the appellant of thirteen
    counts arising out of the events at the dealership, including assault causing
    bodily harm, aggravated assault, robbery with a weapon, and discharging a firearm
    with intent to endanger life. He also convicted the appellant of five
    additional counts as a result of a firearm and drugs found in his possession when
    he was arrested several days after the robbery.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant had a significant criminal record
    at the time of these offences, including convictions for participation in two
    home invasions in which victims were injured. In each home invasion, the
    appellant was carrying, and brandished, a shotgun. The trial judge granted the
    Crown’s application to designate the appellant a dangerous offender and imposed
    a sentence of indeterminate incarceration.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals from his convictions on
    two of the counts on which he was convicted. He also appeals the dangerous
    offender designation and the indeterminate sentence.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    conviction appeal. I would grant leave to appeal sentence, but would dismiss
    the sentence appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Robbery and Arrest</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant does not challenge the trial
    judge’s factual findings as to what occurred on May 3, 2012 or at the time of
    his arrest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that the appellant and his
    co-accused, Jacob Jeffrey and Clarence Morrison, had a joint plan to commit a
    robbery at Humberview Motorsports, a car dealership. On May 3, they drove
    together to the dealership before it opened, parked in a discrete location
    behind it, and staked it out from a condominium lobby across the street. The
    appellant was carrying a loaded, concealed gun. After a Humberview employee, Mr.
    Cubellis (“Cubellis”), and a potential customer, Mr. Mazzulla (“Mazzulla”) went
    inside the dealership, so did the appellant, Jeffrey, and Morrison. The
    appellant demanded that Cubellis tell him the location of the cash and the
    safe, and give him drugs. The appellant punched Cubellis a number of times and struck
    him above the eye with a hard object, causing him to bleed. Nothing that the
    appellant demanded was forthcoming. The appellant stole Cubellis’ gold chain,
    watch, cash, driver’s licence, and cellphone. Cubellis testified that he begged
    the appellant not to kill him; in response, the appellant pointed a gun at
    Cubellis, who was then on the ground, and intentionally shot him, hitting him
    in the thigh about five inches from his groin. Meanwhile, Jeffrey punched
    Mazzulla in the face and pushed him to the floor, causing injuries to his face.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was arrested on May 7, 2012. At
    the time of his arrest, the police found a rifle and cocaine in the vehicle in
    which the appellant was travelling. The trial judge found that the rifle
    belonged to the appellant and that he was in possession of the cocaine.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Convictions</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of the following
    offences arising out of the May&nbsp;3 events:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Count #1 – assault causing bodily harm on
    Cubellis. Count #1 charged aggravated assault by maiming; the trial judge was
    not satisfied that Cubellis had been maimed by the gunshot, but convicted the
    appellant of the lesser and included offence of assault causing bodily harm.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Count #2 – aggravated assault by wounding on
    Mazzulla. The appellant was convicted as a party to the offence of which
    Jeffrey was the principal, since “it was a probable consequence of carrying out
    the three men’s common intention to commit a robbery at the dealership that Mr.
    Mazzulla would be assaulted.”</span></p>

    participation, with others, in two violent home invasion robberies in 2002 and
    2003, in which victims were beaten with a shotgun. In one of the home
    invasions, a victim was also stabbed several times. The appellant had carried,

    He argues that Mazzulla’s injuries were not sufficient to constitute “wounding”

    substituted on this count.</span></p>

    received stitches or other medical treatment, the cut did not amount to a wound
    that could support a charge of aggravated assault. He submits that a wound in
    the context of aggravated assault requires breaking of the skin that rises to
    the standard of serious bodily harm; that is, harm that interferes in a
    substantial way with the integrity, health or well-being of the complainant.
    The appellant relies on a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal that
    was not available to the trial judge: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v.

    redundant the other modes of committing the offence. Although one could
    generally infer an intent to endanger life when a firearm is discharged at a
    lethal area such as the head or chest, here the appellant argues it was aimed
    at a less lethal area – the leg. The trial judge did not explain why he drew

    the appellant growing more irate and being “so agitated”. He begged the appellant

    home invasions in 2002 and 2003 and his behaviour in the predicate offences. He
    noted that “[o]</span><span lang=EN>n all three occasions Mr.&nbsp;Brown was
    armed with a weapon and invaded premises with accomplices for the purpose of
    committing a violent robbery. In all cases victims were injured as a result of

    similar pattern of violent behaviour on Mr. Brown’s part.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the finding of

    offences as a party, not a principal. The appellant submits that there was no
    evidence that the appellant was the person who actually caused injury by
    applying physical force to another person in the home invasions, yet the trial
    judge proceeded on the basis that he was. The predicate offences were the only
    time that the appellant had been convicted as the principal offender who
    actually committed the act of violence in the sense of directly injuring
    another person.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that this is a dissimilarity
    and one that is important, for two reasons. First, the fewer the number of
    offences said to make up the pattern of repetitive behaviour, the higher the
    degree of similarity that is required: <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Hogg</em>, 2011 ONCA
    840, 287 O.A.C. 82, at paras. 39-40. Second, the dangerous offender provisions
    are aimed at preventing future violent (or sexual) offending, not criminal
    behaviour in general. Therefore, it is significant whether each offence
    comprising the pattern involved violence by the offender resulting from the
    offender’s failure to restrain his or her behaviour.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant’s convictions as a party to
    the offences involved in the home invasions do not, in this case, create a
    meaningful dissimilarity to his convictions as a principal in the predicate
    offences. A person may be convicted as a party only where their conduct has
    extended beyond presence at the scene or passive acquiescence. They must have
    engaged in encouragement of the principal, or an act which facilitates the
    commission of the offence, or an act which tends to prevent or hinder interference
    with accomplishment of the criminal act: <em>Dunlop and Sylvester v. The Queen</em>,

lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the evidence was that the
    appellant’s behaviour in each of the home invasions included carrying and
    brandishing a shotgun. The appellant admitted that to Dr. Pearce, who performed
    a psychiatric assessment of the appellant under s. 752.1 of the <em>Code</em>. It
    was also undisputed that victims in each home invasion were beaten with a
    shotgun.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant points out that Dr. Pearce testified
    that the appellant had not told him that he was the one who administered the
    beatings, and therefore the trial judge was wrong to say in his reasons that
    the appellant had struck a victim with a shotgun in the first home invasion. I
    do not accept that argument. The facts accepted by the appellant when he pled
    guilty to offences arising out of the first home invasion were that the
    appellant was one of three men who invaded the premises; one carrying a
    shotgun, one a knife, and one unarmed. When a victim resisted, he was “struck on
    the head with the butt of [the] shotgun carried by one of [the] three persons.”
    The appellant’s admission that he was the person who carried the shotgun
    supports the trial judge’s inference that he was the one who struck the victim.
    I am not satisfied that it was an error for the trial judge to have interpreted
    the evidence that way.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In any event, even without that inference, the appellant’s
    behaviour in the home invasions was violent, from two perspectives. First, he was
    a party to offences which involved the application of physical force, which his
    conduct encouraged, or facilitated, or prevented interference with. And second,
    his brandishing of a shotgun as part of a home invasion was itself a threat to
    cause harm, which falls within the definition of a serious personal injury
    offence, as it is defined in s. 752 of the <em>Code</em>: “the use or attempted
    use of violence against another person”: <em>R. v. Steele</em>, 2014 SCC 61, [2014]

lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, it was open to the trial judge to
    conclude that the behaviour in the home invasions and that in the predicate
    offences formed a pattern of repetitive behaviour. They each demonstrated the
    same failure of the appellant to restrain his behaviour, leading to violence. In
    all of the incidents, the appellant, armed with a shotgun, invaded premises
    with accomplices for the purpose of a violent robbery in which victims were
    injured. It was open to the trial judge to find significant similarities. The
    trial judge was not required to treat the home invasions and predicate offences
    as dissimilar types of behaviour even if in the former robberies, an accomplice
    may have inflicted the physical injury, while in the other, the appellant
    personally inflicted the physical injury. The trial judge was entitled to view
    them as “a very similar pattern of violent behaviour” by the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant’s argument that the trial
    judge failed to distinguish a pattern that supports a prediction of future
    violent behaviour, as opposed to criminal behaviour in general, is
    unpersuasive. The trial judge expressly noted that the “pattern of behaviour
    must contain enough of the same elements of unrestrained dangerous conduct to
    be able to predict that Mr. Brown will likely offend in the same way in the
    future.” He focussed on the correct question. His conclusion, that “a very
    similar pattern of violent behaviour on Mr. Brown’s part” had been established,

lang=EN-CA>Pattern of Persistent Aggressive Behaviour Under s. 753(1)(a)(ii) and

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argues that the trial judge
    erred in finding a “pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the offender …
    showing a substantial degree of indifference” as required under s.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the requirement of
    persistent aggressive behaviour requires a more consistent pattern — more
    examples of the behaviour and greater similarity among them — than that needed to
    satisfy the requirement of repetitive behaviour under s. 753(a)(i). Therefore,
    the trial judge’s approach of finding the same conduct satisfied both ss.
    753(a)(i) and (ii) was flawed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not give effect to this argument. The
    test under s. 753(a)(ii) “does not depend upon similarities among the predicate
    offences”: <em>R. v. C.W.</em>, 2019&nbsp;ONCA&nbsp;976, at para. 28. In my
    view, it was reasonable for the trial judge to reach the conclusion that the
    home invasions and the predicate offences formed a pattern of persistent
    aggressive behaviour. They each involved aggressive behaviour that was
    persistent – the appellant returned to the behaviour even after having been
    convicted and incarcerated for prior episodes of it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argues that the trial judge
    was obliged to consider the appellant’s expressions of remorse on the question
    of whether the appellant’s behaviour exhibited a substantial degree of
    indifference to the reasonable consequences of his actions to other persons.
    The appellant relies on a statement made by the appellant to Dr. Pearce in
    which he told Dr. Pearce that he had apologized to a victim of one of the home
    invasions. The appellant also relies on a letter he wrote to the trial judge at
    the time of sentencing expressing remorse for the injuries to Cubellis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the trial judge was not required to
    accept the expressions of remorse as preventing the inference that the
    appellant showed a substantial degree of indifference to the consequences of
    his actions. He accepted the evidence of Dr. Pearce who wrote in his report
    that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Overall … it is my opinion that Mr. Brown is
    likely to re-offend violently absent significant interventions. In my view, he
    has demonstrated a repetitive pattern of behaviour with respect to his assaults
    on others. He has committed serious violent offences towards several victims by
    virtue of his involvement in the drug trade and he has repeatedly returned to
    this ‘career’. Such behaviour could quite easily cause serious physical injury
    and/or severe psychological damage to his victims.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>… He has nonetheless
    and without fail, continued to use substances, interact with
    criminally-inclined peers and immersed himself in the drug culture. Thus there
    is, in my opinion, ‘significant psychiatric support for the notion that </span><span
class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Brown has manifested indifference to the
    reasonably foreseeable consequences of his behaviour’</span></span><span
lang=EN>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Pearce was expressly asked whether he had
    taken into account any expressions of remorse in reaching that conclusion and
    he confirmed he had, but gave greater significance to the repetition of the
    conduct that followed such expressions. He testified that the appellant said he
    felt bad about the 2002 and 2003 home invasions but “then again he has, sort
    of, more violence in, in similar type crimes leading to this current assessment
    … [H]e can say he’s remorseful but then if his actions indicate otherwise then we
    have to take that into account.” The trial judge was similarly entitled to take
    into account both the appellant’s words and actions. The appellant’s
    expressions of remorse did not preclude a finding that he was indifferent to
    the consequences of his actions.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Treatment Prospects at the Designation Stage</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that in determining whether
    to designate him a dangerous offender, the trial judge erred by not considering
    the appellant’s treatment prospects. The trial judge did not address whether
    the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant, in
    light of his treatment prospects, presented a high likelihood of harmful
    recidivism or that his violent pattern was intractable. This assessment is
    required at the designation stage by the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>R. v.
    Boutilier</em>, 2017 SCC 64, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 936, at para. 45.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown concedes this error. The trial judge
    did not have the benefit of the decision in <em>Boutilier</em> when he
    sentenced the appellant. However, such an error will not undermine the
    designation if there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have
    been any different if the error of law had not been made: <em>C.W., </em>at
    paras. 29-30.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, that is the situation here. Dr.
    Pearce gave evidence about the appellant’s high risk of violent recidivism,
    that he suffered from treatment resistant conditions, and that his poor history
    of treatment and supervision made the chances of his successfully accepting
    more treatment low. The trial judge considered the appellant’s treatment
    prospects on the question of whether the appellant’s risk could be managed in
    the community, which was relevant to whether there was a reasonable expectation
    that something less than an indeterminate sentence could manage the appellant’s
    future risk. As the trial judge stated, “The determination of whether Mr.
    Brown’s risk can be reduced to an acceptable level requires consideration of
    all factors, including whether he can be treated, so as to bring about
    sufficient risk reduction to ensure protection of the public”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge concluded that there was no such

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given the above and the other findings the trial
    judge made that satisfied him that the criteria for a designation had been met,
    in my view there is no reasonable possibility that the trial judge would not
    have made the designation even if he had considered treatment prospects at that
    stage.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge, in
    imposing an indeterminate sentence, applied an overly onerous, legally
    incorrect standard that is virtually impossible for an offender to meet. He
    submits that the trial judge erred in concluding that there was no reasonable
    possibility that a lesser measure than an indeterminate sentence could
    adequately protect the public, because he misunderstood the statutory scheme for
    a long-term supervision order (LTSO).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The alleged misunderstanding relates to an
    example the trial judge gave of “[o]ne of the potential problems” with
    supervision of an offender on an LTSO. He expressed his view that if the
    appellant breached a condition of an LTSO, his release into the community could
    only be suspended for 90 days unless he was successfully prosecuted under s.
    753.3 of the <em>Code</em>, and even if he was successfully prosecuted, he
    would be released into the community after he served the sentence for this
    offence regardless of risk to the community.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge’s
    example demonstrates that he misapprehended the statutory scheme for an LTSO in
    four respects. First, the appellant’s release into the community could be
    suspended before he breached any condition of an LTSO, if the Parole Board
    believed such a suspension was necessary to prevent a breach or protect
    society. Second, if the appellant breached a condition of his LTSO, he could be
    charged criminally, denied bail, and committed to custody. Third, if convicted
    of a breach of condition, the Crown could apply for an indeterminate sentence
    or a further LTSO. Fourth, while an LTSO can only be suspended for 90 days at a
    time (in contrast to an indeterminate sentence in which parole can be revoked
    permanently), the Parole Board may order multiple 90-day suspensions where
    necessary. The trial judge expressed the view that if an indeterminate sentence
    was imposed, the Parole Board would be best positioned to determine, at a later
    date, if the risk created by the appellant could be managed in the community
    and grant him parole. In the appellant’s submission, this view made the trial
    judge’s failure to appreciate the role of the Parole Board in the LTSO scheme
    important.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not give effect to this argument. First,
    the trial judge’s example followed a more general statement that after
    considering the evidence of a parole officer, it was unclear to him </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>“</span><span lang=EN-CA>whether the level
    of supervision that can be provided by [Correctional Service Canada] would be
    sufficient to ensure the safety of the public should Mr. Brown be released into
    the community on a LTSO.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, I do not read the trial judge’s example
    as purporting to set out an exhaustive list of ways in which the appellant’s risk
    to the community could be managed under an LTSO, and therefore do not conclude
    that he failed to appreciate that legislative scheme. He correctly set out one consequence
    of a finding of a breach of the LTSO, which he considered one of the “potential
    problems” with an LTSO. It was not necessary for him to review all other
    aspects of the scheme, since the focus of the trial judge’s determination that
    an LTSO was insufficient was that “[t]he evidence before me does not support a
    finding that [the appellant] can be reasonably managed in the community within
    a definite period of time.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge accepted Dr. Pearce’s evidence
    about whether the appellant could be considered treatable and whether such
    treatment could be effective in lowering the risk to the public both during the
    period in which he would be subject to an LTSO and after its expiry. Based on a
    number of factors, including the appellant’s diagnosis and prognosis, previous
    poor response to treatment, poor chances of successful treatment, and poor record
    of compliance with supervision, Dr. Pearce’s ultimate conclusion was that: “while
    there is a possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community, I am
    not able to conclude that there is a reasonable expectation of same from a
    psychiatric perspective.” Dr. Pearce reached that conclusion while
    acknowledging that possible employment prospects of the appellant with family
    members, and other family supports, had positive aspects to them.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s conclusion followed that of
    Dr. Pearce. He explained that he did not have a reasonable expectation that the
    public could be adequately protected from the appellant by any measure less
    than an indeterminate sentence. He concluded that on the evidence before him, “it
    would be far too speculative and unreasonably hopeful to conclude that [the
    appellant] will submit to appropriate treatment and supervision so that he will
    no longer pose a risk to the safety of society within a definite period of
    time.” This conclusion was not unreasonable.</span></p>

    imposed an indeterminate sentence for Counts #1, 2, 5, and 6. He argues that
    the trial judge should have imposed a stay of proceedings on Count #5 because
    the assault with a gun was subsumed by Count #1. In my view, the stay under <em>Kienapple</em> was appropriate and does not affect the dangerous offender designation on the
