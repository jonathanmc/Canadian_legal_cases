lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the order of Justice Gilmore of the Superior Court of
    Justice, dated March 18, 2020.</span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS
    FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These two appeals arise out of a failed business plan which attempted
    unsuccessfully to revive a bankrupt manufacturing company. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plan involved a secured loan to a new entity that would operate a business.
    The bankrupt manufacturing company would transfer its assets to the new company
    and a general security agreement would be provided. A Quitclaim Deed was to be
    provided regarding the assets which were referred to as the “Trailered Assets”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, this project failed as well. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At issue is whether the Trailered Assets are subject to the security
    agreement. This depends on whether the Quitclaim is enforceable. The motion
    judge concluded that the Quitclaim was not a valid contract and hence was not
    enforceable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, the former operator of the failed company sought payment for
    work that he had done in anticipation of the new business. The motion judge
    awarded him a salary on the basis of unjust enrichment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal involving the assets
    because the Quitclaim is unenforceable. However, we allow the appeal with
    respect to the salary to be paid to the former operator. </p>
  <p class=Heading>FACTS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=FR>The appellant ESC Enterprises Inc. </span><span
lang=EN-CA>(“ESC”) is held by a sole shareholder, Ed Siu-Chong (“Ed”). Ed owns </span>50%
    of the shares of the appellant Strongco Plastics Ltd. (“Plastics”). The
    respondent Marcelo Hernandez (“Marcelo”) and his business partner operated a
    company “BuiltRite”, which manufactured windows, doors, decking systems and prefabricated
    housing components. BuiltRite was deemed bankrupt on October 31, 2017. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In November 2017, a representative from BuiltRite approached ESC
    with a business plan. The plan contemplated a convertible loan of $1 million,
    secured against BuiltRite assets worth $5.5 million. There were two types of
    assets: 1) the unencumbered “Trailered Assets”, which included dies worth $2
    million and were owned by a separate company, Strongco Ltd. (“Strongco”)<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a>;
    and 2) the encumbered “Warehoused Assets”, which were owned by BuiltRite. Some
    of the Trailered Assets had been loaned from a third party and would not form
    part of the security for the proposed investment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ed proposed an alternative structure whereby a new company would
    operate the business. Ed would advance funds to the new company on a secured
    basis. On February 2, 2018, the new company, Plastics, was incorporated. It was
    agreed that Plastics would purchase the Warehoused Assets from the facility
    where they were stored, and Strongco would roll the Trailered Assets into
    Plastics.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In February 2018, ESC registered a security interest under the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Personal Property Security Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span>(“PPSA”)
    for all of Plastics’ inventory, equipment, accounts, personal property and
    motor vehicles. On March 14, 2018, to secure advances under the loan, Plastics
    executed a Grid Promissory Note and a General Security Agreement in favour of
    ESC. Thus, ESC is the sole registered secured creditor of Plastics under the
    PPSA. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On March 14, 2018, a Unanimous Shareholders Agreement (“USA”) was
    signed between the principals of the corporations. At this time, ESC executed
    an undertaking in favour of Plastics, stating that ESC would advance an
    aggregate of $1 million, less all amounts advanced at any time and listed in
    the grid promissory note. The advancement would occur provided “there is no
    impediment to the advancement of the business of the Corporation on a
    profitable basis, other than the failure of the undersigned to advance the
    amounts provided for herein on the terms set forth herein.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To effect a “roll in” of the Trailered Assets into Plastics, a
    Quitclaim Deed dated February, 2018 was prepared by counsel for ESC and
    Plastics. The Quitclaim Deed stated that Strongco quitclaimed all right, title
    and interest in and to the personal property and assets listed in “Schedule A”
    for the benefit of Plastics. When the Quitclaim was signed on April 13, 2018,
    Schedule A was blank. Marcelo’s counsel advised counsel for ESC and Plastics
    that Schedule A would need to be revised once Marcelo had inventoried the
    equipment, and then a revised Schedule A would be “slip sheeted” in. Marcelo
    never completed an inventory, and no Schedule A was “slip sheeted” in. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    August 1, 2018, there was insufficient remaining committed capital to resume the
    business. The parties agreed to sell the Trailered Assets and Warehoused
    Assets. On October 2, 2018, while attempting to sell the assets, Marcelo raised
    the question of their ownership.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In February 2019, Marcelo sold certain dies for $85,000,
    notwithstanding the question of their ownership. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties agreed that Marcelo was to receive an annual salary of $100,000 plus a
    yearly bonus of up to $40,000. They disagree as to when the salary was to
    commence. </p>
  <p class=Heading>DECISION BELOW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were two applications in the court below giving rise to these two appeals. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the first application, the appellants ESC and Plastics sought an order
    declaring that equipment had been transferred to Plastics. The motion judge
    dismissed the application on the basis that the Quitclaim agreement was not
    enforceable. ESC and Plastics appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the second application, the applicant Marcelo sought compensation for work he
    had performed. The motion judge granted his application. ESC and Plastics appeal.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application by ESC and Plastics</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge determined that the Quitclaim was not a
    binding contract because it lacked certainty and because no consideration was
    given for the Quitclaim. The application judge held that the Quitclaim was
    unclear as to which assets formed part of Schedule A, there was no agreement on
    the timing of the purported transfer of assets from Strongco to Plastics and the
    words “roll-in” were never defined. Further, the application judge held that
    consideration for the Quitclaim was intended to be ESC’s advance of $1 million
    to Plastics, which was never completed. The application judge also determined
    that the dies were never transferred to Plastics by way of Schedule A and
    therefore that Marcelo was within his rights to sell the dies.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Application by Marcelo for salary</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge ordered that ESC pay Marcelo for work
    performed for Plastics from January to August 2018. She found that ESC was
    unjustly enriched by Marcelo’s services from January to August 2018, as Marcelo
    was deprived of a living, ESC benefited from his services and there was no
    reason for the deprivation. She ordered ESC to pay Marcelo $66,666 for January
    to August 2018, being the prorated amount of a salary of $100,000.</p>
  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS </p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal by ESC and Plastics</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We see no error in the application judge’s
    determination that the Quitclaim is unenforceable. When it </span>was signed in
    April 2018, Schedule A was blank, and it was unclear to the parties which
    assets would have formed part of Schedule A. The Quitclaim did not specify the
    timing for the transfer of assets. Neither party had a real understanding of
    what the Quitclaim represented. Therefore, the agreement cannot constitute an
    enforceable contract.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants submit that even if Schedule A to the Quitclaim
    was not technically finalized, equity will treat it as finalized, as “equity
    considers done that which ought to have been done” and Marcelo should have
    conducted the inventory. However, the lack of an up-to-date Schedule A was not
    the only issue with the Quitclaim. As the application judge noted, the Schedule
    A was blank, the parties were unclear which assets would be listed in Schedule
    A, and other terms in the Quitclaim were uncertain. The Supreme Court of Canada
    recently reaffirmed the applicable test for finding that an agreement exists at
    common law in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Owners, Strata Plan LMS 3905 v. Crystal
    Square Parking Corp.</span></em>, 2020 SCC 29, 450 D.L.R. (4th) 105, at para.
    37: “The test is objective, and the offer, acceptance, consideration and terms
    may be inferred from the parties’ conduct and the surrounding circumstances.”
    Here, essential terms could not be inferred due to the parties’ unclear
    intentions. These standalone issues with the Quitclaim, aside from the issues
    with Schedule A, mean that even if equity treated Schedule A as finalized the
    Quitclaim would still be unenforceable. Thus, the appellants cannot rely on the
    equitable maxim to render the Quitclaim enforceable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the appellants submit that there is an “abundance of
    proof” that the dies were intended to be rolled into Plastics, they fail to
    point to any actual proof. The only mention of the dies in any documents
    prepared by the parties was in the original promotional PowerPoint
    presentation, but there was no evidence to link the dies to the final business
    deal. <span lang=EN-CA>In any event, since</span> the Quitclaim was not
    enforceable, the dies were not transferred to Plastics.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal by ESC and Plastics is dismissed.</p>
  <h2>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marcelo’s Salary</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge’s determination with respect to Marcelo’s salary cannot stand
    for three interrelated reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    she accepted Marcelo’s evidence that he never agreed to forgo his salary. She
    said: “Marcelo denies that he ever agreed to forgo his salary and potential

    respect to unjust enrichment is set out in two short paragraphs:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par91>91</a>] I find that ESC has
    been unjustly enriched by Marcelo’s services between January and August 2018.
    Marcelo has been deprived of a living for himself and his family during that
    period, and ESC has benefitted from Marcelo’s experience and services without
    having to compensate him for those services. There was no reason for such a
    deprivation as it defies logic that Marcelo would forgo payment for his
    services in this factual scenario.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par92>92</a>] As such, the test for
    unjust enrichment in<em> Consulate Ventures Inc. v. Amico Contracting and
    Engineering (1992) Inc.,</em> 2007 ONCA 324, 282 D.L.R. (4th) 697, at paras. 95-99
    has been made out and Marcelo should receive the sum of $66,666 being the
    prorated amount of a salary of $100,000 for January to August 2018.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><em><span lang=EN-CA>Consulate Ventures</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> at para. 99 explains the ingredients of a juristic reason for the
    award:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, where the
    claim for restitutionary relief is based on<em> quantum meruit</em>, as in this
    case, an explicit mutual agreement to compensate for services rendered is not a
    prerequisite to recovery. It suffices if the services in question were
    furnished at the request, or with the encouragement or acquiescence, of the
    opposing party in circumstances that render it unjust for the opposing party to
    retain the benefit conferred by the provision of the services. See <em>Fridman,
    supra,</em> at pp. 290-92;<em> Nicholson v. St. Denis</em> (1975),</span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, Marcelo’s work was done for Plastics, not
    ESC. Yet ESC was ordered to pay. Even though the main shareholder of each
    corporation is the same person, we see no reason to pierce the corporate veil
    and require ESC to pay for work done for Plastics. This court in</span><span
lang=EN-CA> </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Yaiguaje v. Chevron Corporation</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, 2018 ONCA 472, 141 O.R. (3d) 1, at para. 65, citing</span><span

    Canada v. Canada Life Insurance Co. </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>(1996), 28 O.R.
    (3d) 423 (S.C.), explained the circumstances in which a corporate veil can be
    pierced: 1) when the court is construing a statute, contract, or other
    document; 2) when the court is satisfied that a company is a “mere facade”
    concealing the true facts; and 3) when it can be established that the company
    is an authorized agent of its controllers or its members, corporate or human.
    These factors are not present here. Consequently, even if unjust enrichment had
    been established, it could not attach to ESC.</span></p>
