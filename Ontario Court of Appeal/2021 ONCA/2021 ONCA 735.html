  <p><strong>Watt J.A.:
    </strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A jury found the applicant guilty of sexual assault. The trial judge
    imposed a sentence of imprisonment for eighteen months. A judge of this court
    ordered the applicant released pending the determination of his appeal against
    conviction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant sought funding for his appeal from Legal Aid Ontario (LAO).
    He relied on an opinion letter from counsel that set out several proposed
    grounds of appeal. Each ground alleged an error or omission in the trial judge’s
    charge to the jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 20, 2020, LAO declined the applicant’s funding request. The
    applicant appealed. On February 25, 2021 the appeal was dismissed. LAO would
    not be funding the applicant’s appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 8, 2021, the applicant applied to the chambers judge for an
    order under s. 684(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> that counsel be assigned to
    act on his behalf on his appeal from conviction. The chambers judge dismissed
    the application.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant now seeks an order quashing the order of the chambers
    judge and directing that counsel be appointed under s.684(1) to act on the
    applicant’s behalf with her fees and disbursements being paid by the Attorney
    General who is the respondent on appeal in accordance with s. 684(2) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of argument, we dismissed the application. We said
    that we would explain why we came to that conclusion. We do so now.</p>
  <h2>The Essential Background</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A brief reference to the proceedings before the chambers judge will
    provide the essential background.</p>
  <h3>The Chambers Motion</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the chambers judge, the applicant contended that an order under
    s. 684 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> was desirable in the interests of justice.
    The applicant lacked sufficient means to retain counsel. His appeal was
    meritorious. And, left to his own devices, he lacked the ability to argue the
    case on his own.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent opposed the motion, principally on the basis that the
    appeal was bankrupt of merit. The respondent acknowledged that the applicant
    lacked the means necessary to retain counsel and appears to have accepted that
    the applicant lacked the ability to advance argument on his own behalf.</p>
  <h3>The Decision of the Chambers Judge</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The chambers judge accepted that the statutory standard in s. 684(1)
    required her to determine whether it appeared desirable in the interests of
    justice that the applicant should have legal assistance to argue his appeal and
    that he lacked sufficient means to do so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was uncontroversial, the chambers judge explained, that the applicant
    lacked the financial means to retain counsel. She was also not prepared to say,
    as counsel for the respondent had argued, that the appeal lacked merit.
    However, funding orders are exceptional. The circumstances did not satisfy the
    “interests of justice” standard. The issues raised were straightforward. They
    could be advanced by duty counsel in an inmate appeal with the assistance of
    the opinion letter counsel wrote to LAO seeking funding. The issues could also
    be determined by a panel of the court assigned to inmate appeals.</p>
  <h3>This Application</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court the applicant seeks an order quashing the order of the
    chambers judge. In its place, he asks that we appoint Ms. Zita as his counsel
    and direct that her fees and disbursements be paid by the Attorney General who
    is the respondent in the appeal.</p>
  <h3>The Arguments of Counsel</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant invokes several sources as a basis upon which we can
    review the order of the chambers judge. Those sources include:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Practice Direction concerning Criminal Appeals;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>section 683(3) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em>;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Practice Direction concerning Civil Appeals; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iv.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>section 7(5) of the<em> Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S O. 1990, c.C 43.
    (<em>CJA</em>).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To obtain an order under s. 684, the applicant accepts, he must show
    that it is in “the interests of justice” that counsel be appointed to act on
    his behalf. The order is discretionary. Whether it should issue depends upon
    and requires consideration of all the circumstances. These include the merits
    of the appeal, the appellant’s ability to present his case without the
    assistance of counsel, and the ability of the court to determine the issues
    raised without the assistance of counsel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the applicant continues, the appeal has substantial merit.
    It alleges specific errors and omissions in the charge to the jury, thus
    surpasses the standard that it be arguable. The proceedings under review were a
    10-day jury trial with pre-trial and in-trial motions including a s 276. application.
    There was a pre-charge conference about what should be included in the charge.
    The jury asked questions. These issues are well beyond the ability of the
    appellant to present to the Court. Further, the Duty Counsel Program available
    in inmate appeals is not an adequate substitute for fully-funded counsel. The
    availability of assistance from that program should not undermine meritorious
    s. 684 applications.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent challenges the review mechanisms asserted by the
    applicant. Rights of appeal are entirely statutory. The <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> provides no right of appeal from refusal of an order under s. 684. And the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> is where any appellate rights must be found. Section 7(5) of the
    C<em>JA</em>, alone or together with s. 683(3) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code,</em> is of no avail. The <em>CJA</em> does not apply to criminal proceedings. And it
    is well settled that it, in tandem with s. 683(3) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em>,
    affords no basis of appeal or review. Likewise, Practice Directions which
    implement but cannot create rights of appeal or review.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the merits, the respondent points out that the remedy
    afforded by s. 684 is discretionary. Decisions granting or refusing the
    appointment of funded counsel are accorded significant deference on appeal. In
    this case, the applicant has not demonstrated any basis upon which we should
    interfere. The circumstances have not changed. The chambers judge did not err in
    law or depart from governing principles. She did not dismiss the application on
    the basis that the Duty Counsel Program would be an adequate or sufficient
    substitute for funded counsel. The chambers judge simply observed that the
    straightforward issues advanced by the applicant could be properly advanced by
    Duty Counsel aided by the opinion letter prepared by counsel. And this court,
    assisted by Duty Counsel, and counsel for the respondent, is well-positioned to
    decide the appeal without funded counsel.</p>

    Review</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span

    are entitled to review the decision of the chambers judge. </p>
  <h3>Rights of Appeal under the <em>Criminal Code</em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The right of appeal is an exceptional right. Appellate rights, procedure
    on appeal, and the jurisdiction of appellate courts are wholly creatures of
    statute. An appellate court such as this has no inherent jurisdiction to
    entertain an appeal in criminal cases<em>: Welch v. The King</em> [1950], S.C.R
    412, at page 428; <em>R. v. Morgentaler, Smoling and Scott</em> (1984), 16 CCC (3d)
    1 (Ont. CA), at pages 5-6; <em>R. v. Smithen-Davis</em>, 2020 ONCA 759, at
    paras. 27-28. Where no right of appeal is given, none exists.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 684 contains no provision that authorizes an appeal by any party
    to the proceedings under the section. Nor is an appeal authorized by any other
    provision in Part XXI or elsewhere in the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em>. See
    by comparison, s. 490(17) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <h3>Sections 683(3) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> and 7(5) of the <em>CJA</em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 683(3) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> permits a court of
    appeal to exercise, in relation to proceedings in the court, any powers beyond
    those in s. 683(1) that the court can exercise in civil matters. Section 7(5)
    of the <em>CJA</em> permits a panel of the court, on motion, to set aside or
    vary a decision made by a single judge of the court on a motion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 683(3) cannot reasonably be read as extending the appellate
    jurisdiction of a court of appeal beyond the jurisdiction the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> expressly grants it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 683(1) defines the authority of a court of appeal to make
    procedural orders to facilitate the hearing and adjudication of an appeal,
    provided the court concludes that it is in “the interests of justice” to make
    these orders. Section 683(3) expands the express authority granted by s. 683(1)
    to include any power the court may exercise in civil matters: <em>R. v. Perkins</em>,
    2017 ONCA 152, 347 CCC (3d) 58, at paras. 21-22; <em>R. v. Codina</em>, 2009
    ONCA 907, 266 CCC (3d) 1, at para. 8.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On its own, s. 7(5) <em>CJA</em> cannot ground a right of appeal in
    criminal proceedings. The province lacks the constitutional competence to
    create rights of appeal in criminal cases: <em>Perkins</em>, at para. 63.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor does the combination of sections 683(3) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> and 7(5) of the <em>CJA</em> fare any better as a source of appellate
    jurisdiction. To decide otherwise would be to encroach on Parliament’s
    exclusive jurisdiction to determine rights of appeal in criminal proceedings: <em>Perkins,</em> at para. 23.</p>
  <h3>The <em>Criminal Appeal Rules</em> and <em>Practice
    Directions</em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 482(1) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> permits a court of
    appeal to make rules of court not inconsistent with the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> or any other Act of Parliament. These rules apply to appeals within the
    jurisdiction of the court instituted in relation to criminal proceedings. Rules
    may be made under s. 482(3)(d) to carry out the <em>Code’s</em> provisions
    relating to appeals. However, this rule-making authority cannot be invoked to
    extend the substantive jurisdiction of the court. The authority to make rules,
    equally to issue practice directions, is limited to matters already within the
    jurisdiction of the court. Rules implement jurisdiction otherwise granted. They
    do not create substantive rights that do not otherwise exist: <em>Smithen-Davis</em>,
    at paras. 27-28; <em>McEwen (Re)</em>, 2020 ONCA 511, at paras. 53-55. See
    also, <em>R. v. O’Malley</em> (1997), 119 CCC (3d) 360 (BCCA), at para. 18.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, neither the <em>Criminal Appeal Rules</em> nor the <em>Practice</em> <em>Directions</em> of the court can ground a right of appeal or of review for
    which the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> does not provide.</p>
  <h3>Section 684 and Concurrent Jurisdiction</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A judge and a panel of judges of this court have equivalent jurisdiction
    to determine whether an order for state-funded counsel is desirable in the
    interests of justice under s. 684(1) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em>. In
    other words, the jurisdiction of a single judge and a panel of judges is
    concurrent. This is not unique to s. 684. See, for example, ss. 675(1)(a)(ii);
    (b)(1.1); 678(2); and 839(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mere fact of concurrent jurisdiction in a single judge and a panel
    of the court does not mean that a panel of judges has authority to “review” the
    order of a single judge or sit on appeal of that order. To decide otherwise
    would be at odds with the very essence of concurrent jurisdiction. Separate,
    but equal. Indeed, the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> confirms as much when it
    provides, for example, in s. 675(4), for a right to a panel hearing when leave
    to appeal is refused by a single judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet the absence of a review authority does not mean that a judge and a
    panel of the court cannot both exercise jurisdiction to consider a request for
    the appointment of state-funded counsel in the same case. As this court has
    previously decided, in an appropriate case, a panel of the court may exercise
    its s. 684 jurisdiction even though a judge of the court has refused to do so: <em>R.
    v. Bernardo</em> (1997), 121 CCC (3d) 123 (Ont. CA), at para. 12.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Bernardo</em> court did not define the scope of what it
    considered “appropriate” to warrant panel consideration of an application for
    state-funded counsel under s. 684 after rejection of an application for the
    same relief by a single judge. It was not necessary for the court to formulate
    a test or standard or otherwise to define the outer reaches of what might
    engage the concurrent jurisdiction of a panel after consideration by a single
    judge. Suffice it to say, that what prompted the <em>Bernardo</em> court to
    exercise its concurrent jurisdiction was a change of circumstances. What
    changed, as the single judge contemplated in his refusal of the application,
    was that substantial parts of the trial record not available to the single
    judge became available to the panel. This enabled the panel to make a more
    mature assessment of the complexity of the appeal and the appellant’s ability
    to effectively argue the appeal without the assistance of counsel: <em>Bernardo,</em> at para. 12.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Absent from the decision in <em>Bernardo</em> is any suggestion that the
    panel was exercising an appellate jurisdiction in relation to the decision of
    the single judge. The authorities invoked by the <em>Bernardo</em> court, as
    well as its analysis reveal a <em>de</em> <em>novo</em> assessment based on
    changed circumstances: <em>Bernardo</em>, at para 12; <em>R. v. Foster</em> (1954), 110 CCC 214 (Ont. CA), at page 215; <em>R. v. Walker</em> (1978), 46
    CCC (2d) 124 (Que. CA), at page 25.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From this review of the authorities, we are satisfied that there is no
    right of appeal or other review from the chambers judge refusing to direct the
    appointment of state-funded counsel. Our concurrent jurisdiction permits us to
    consider the application afresh, provided we are satisfied that circumstances
    have changed sufficiently from those before the single judge to warrant a
    reassessment.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>Issue #2: The Merits of the
    Claim</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In large measure, the scope of our jurisdiction on this application
    predestines its demise. We exercise no appellate or cognate review function.
    Rather, we canvass whether there has been a change in circumstances since the
    decision of the application judge. Further, if there has been such a change, we
    evaluate its nature and extent to determine whether the interests of justice
    warrant a different conclusion than reached by the chambers judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the applicant asserts no change in circumstances between
    those prevalent on the determination of the chambers judge and those current on
    this application. This is not a case in which additional relevant material has
    become available after the initial decision. It follows, that the application
    cannot succeed on the basis of changed circumstances.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if we were prepared to conclude that we could exercise our
    concurrent jurisdiction on the basis of a legal error in the reasoning or
    conclusion of the chambers judge, we would not do so here.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The remedy afforded by s. 684(1) -  the appointment of state-funded
    counsel - is discretionary. The applicable standard - “the interests of
    justice” - involves the exercise of a case-specific discretion which is subject
    to substantial deference on appeal absent any error of law or principle,
    misapprehension of material evidence, or a decision that is plainly
    unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the error alleged is that the chambers judge essentially
    concluded that the Duty Counsel Program for inmate appeals was an adequate
    proxy or surrogate for state-funded counsel. We are not persuaded that the
    chambers judge declined the application on this basis. As we understand her
    reasons, the chambers judge concluded that the grounds of appeal to be
    advanced, all of which related to the charge to the jury, were straight forward
    and could be properly advanced on an inmate appeal. This was so despite the
    applicant’s evidence about his learning disability and his challenges with
    reading comprehension and communication.</p>
  <h3>Disposition</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is for these reasons that we dismissed the application for an order
    for state-funded counsel under s. 684.</p>
