  <p><strong>Hoy J.A.: </strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants, M/S Crawford Bayley &amp; Co.
    and Sanjay Asher (“Mr.&nbsp;Asher”), are a law firm based in Mumbai, India, and
    a senior partner of that firm, respectively. Before the motion judge, they
    unsuccessfully argued that Ontario lacks jurisdiction over, and is not the
    convenient forum for, the respondent, Kyko Global Inc.’s action against them.
    They appeal the motion judge’s dismissal of their motion seeking the stay or
    dismissal of Kyko’s action. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Kyko, an Ontario corporation, had retained the
    appellants to provide an opinion on the enforceability of a guarantee to be
    provided by Sical Logistics Limited (“Sical” or the “guarantor”), a publicly-traded
    company in India. The guarantee was security for a trade finance facility
    provided by Kyko to another Indian company, West Coast Marine Private Limited.
    In a letter dated September 9, 2010 addressed to Kyko’s Ontario counsel, the
    appellants opined that the guarantee was enforceable in accordance with its
    terms. The guarantee had Ontario choice of law and forum provisions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unbeknownst to Kyko, it was Mr. Asher’s cousin,
    Yogesh Asher, who effectively brokered Kyko’s agreement to provide the trade
    facility to West Coast Marine Private Limited. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The facility went into default and Kyko obtained
    a default judgment in Ontario against Sical. Sical obtained an interim
    injunction from the High Court of Judicature at Madras, in India, to restrain
    enforcement of the default judgment by alleging that the guarantee was a
    forgery. Police in the City of Chennai (also known as Madras) opened a criminal
    investigation and concluded that the signatures on the guarantee were forged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Kyko subsequently brought this action against
    the appellants for negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of
    contract. At the time the motion was heard, Sical’s injunction application was
    still pending before the Madras High Court. The motion judge noted that Kyko
    concedes that its claim against the appellants may only proceed if the
    guarantee is a forgery, and as a result depends on the outcome of the
    proceeding in the Madras High Court. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge’s decision</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Applying the test in </span><em>Club Resorts
    Ltd. v. </em><em><span lang=EN-US>Van Breda</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, 2012
    SCC 17, [2012] 1&nbsp;S.C.R. 572, the motion judge concluded that two
    presumptive connecting factors were present. Therefore, there was a presumption
    that there was a real and substantial connection between the subject matter of
    the litigation and Ontario. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, there was a good arguable case that the
    tort (fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation) took place in Ontario: in particular,
    there was a good arguable case that the appellants’ legal opinion was first
    provided to Kyko in Ontario; arrangements were made in Ontario to advance the
    credit facility; and Kyko suffered damages in Ontario. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, there was a good arguable case that the
    contract connected to the dispute was made in Ontario. Kyko pleaded this in its
    statement of claim, and the appellants did not adduce any evidence to challenge
    or deny it. In the absence of evidence from the appellants to challenge or deny
    the facts pleaded in Kyko’s claim, Kyko could rely on those facts, which are
    presumed to be true, to presumptively demonstrate jurisdiction </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>simpliciter</span></em><span lang=EN-US>:</span><em><span
lang=EN-US> Ontario v. Rothmans Inc.</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, 2013 ONCA
    353, 115 O.R. (3d) 561, at paras. 111-114, leave to appeal refused, [2013] S.C.C.A.
    No. 327; </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Vahle v. Global Work &amp; Travel Co. Inc.</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2020 ONCA 224, at para. 13. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge noted that the burden of
    rebutting the presumption of jurisdiction is on the party challenging it. The
    appellants were required to show facts to demonstrate that the presumptive
    connecting factors do not point to any real relationship between the subject
    matter of the litigation and the forum, or point to a weak relationship: </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Van Breda</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 95. The motion
    judge found that they had failed to do so and, accordingly, that Ontario had
    jurisdiction </span><em><span lang=EN-US>simpliciter</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> over the action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge then considered whether the
    appellants had discharged their burden of showing why jurisdiction should nevertheless
    be declined in favour of a different forum (</span><em>forum non conveniens</em><span
lang=EN-US>). He correctly noted that the standard to displace the plaintiff’s
    chosen forum is high: the alternate forum must be “clearly more appropriate”
    such that it would be fairer and more efficient to decide the dispute there: </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Van Breda</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, at paras. 108-9. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I discuss in more detail below in addressing
    the fifth issue that the appellants raise on appeal, the motion judge
    considered six factors in the course of his analysis. He concluded that the
    appellants had not discharged their burden to show that their proposed
    alternate forum, Mumbai, is clearly more appropriate. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Issues on appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellants raise five issues on appeal:</span><span lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the motion judge reverse the burden of proof on the test for
    jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em>?</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em> analysis, did the motion judge
    err by accepting allegations in the statement of claim as true despite evidence
    to the contrary?</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the motion judge discount the appellants’ evidence on the location
    of their witnesses in his <em>forum non conveniens</em> analysis as a result of
    a misreading of the applicable jurisprudence?</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the motion judge fail to consider relevant factors in his <em>forum non
    conveniens </em>analysis?</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the motion judge’s decision that the appellants had not discharged
    their burden to show that Mumbai was a clearly more appropriate forum
    unreasonable?  </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-US>First, I address the standard of
    review. Then I address the appellants’ five issues in turn. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Standard of review</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Whether or not a motion judge has erred in the application
    of the test for jurisdiction </span><em>simpliciter</em><span lang=EN-US> is a
    question of mixed fact and law, reviewable for palpable and overriding error,
    unless an error in the application of the test can be attributed to an
    extricable question of law: </span><em>Airia Brands Inc. v. Air Canada</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2017 ONCA 792, 417 D.L.R. (4th) 467 at para. 39, leave to appeal
    refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 476.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is an exercise
    of discretion reviewable in accordance with the principle of deference to
    discretionary decisions. An appeal court should intervene only if the motion
    judge erred in principle, misapprehended or failed to take account of material
    evidence, or reached an unreasonable decision: <em>Young v. Tyco International
    of Canada Ltd.</em>, 2008 ONCA 709, 92 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 27; <em>Éditions
    Écosociété Inc. v. Banro Corp.</em>, 2012 SCC 18, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 636, at para.
    41; <em>Haaretz.com v. Goldhar</em>, 2018 SCC 28, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para.
    49. Errors of law and clear and serious errors of fact may also give grounds
    for intervention: <em>Lapointe Rosenstein Marchand Melançon LLP v. Cassels
    Brock &amp; Blackwell LLP</em>, 2016 SCC 30, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 851, at para.&nbsp;54; <em>Van Breda</em> at para. 112.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With the standard of review in mind, I turn now to the appellants’
    arguments on jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em>.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the motion judge reverse the burden of proof on the test for
    jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em>?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As noted above, the motion judge concluded that
    Kyko has a good arguable case that Kyko first received the opinion in Ontario,
    when it was sent to Kyko’s legal counsel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants point to the evidence that the
    original of the opinion was delivered to Kyko’s CEO, Mr. Kulkarni, in India. They
    argue that the motion judge erred in applying the test for jurisdiction </span><em>simpliciter</em><span
lang=EN-US>: he reversed the burden of proof by only considering whether that
    evidence rebutted the presumption of jurisdiction, and not in determining
    whether Kyko had discharged its onus of establishing that there was a good
    arguable case.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I reject this argument. The motion judge
    recounted that on September 9, 2010, Mr. Asher signed the opinion for his firm
    and faxed it to Ms. Thomas, Kyko’s external legal counsel, at her office in Brampton,
    Ontario. Then, on September 13, 2010, Mr. Asher’s associate, Ms. Batra, emailed
    Ms. Thomas an electronic version of the opinion. That email indicated that the
    opinion “is being handed over to Yogesh [Asher]”. This was done so that he
    could hand-deliver the original opinion to Mr.&nbsp;Kulkarni. There was no
    evidence about when the original opinion was delivered to Mr.&nbsp;Kulkarni.
    The motion judge wrote that “[i]t also appears from the record that Mr.&nbsp;Kulkarni
    could not have received the Opinion before it was sent to Ms. Thomas by
    facsimile on September 9, 2010 and by email on September 13, 2010.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Citing </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Rothmans</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, at paras. 53-54, and </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Vahle</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 13, the motion judge held that on a jurisdiction motion
    brought at an early stage of a proceeding, the court does not assess the facts
    of a case beyond deciding whether a “good arguable case” is shown to ground
    jurisdiction. After considering the appellants’ argument in relation to the
    delivery of the original opinion to Mr. Kulkarni, the motion judge concluded
    that Kyko has a good arguable case that Kyko first received the opinion in
    Ontario. The motion judge did not reverse the burden of proof. He considered
    the evidence on which the appellants rely both in concluding that Kyko has a
    good arguable case, and in concluding that the appellants had not rebutted the
    presumption of jurisdiction. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants also argue that the motion judge’s
    conclusion that there was a good arguable case that the receipt of their
    opinion in Ontario by Ms. Thomas completed the tort of misrepresentation was
    tainted by legal error. They say that the document had to be received by a

    not have written agreements with all its clients. The appellants did not argue
    below that there was no contract. The only issue was where the contract was
    made. In context, including that the opinion was addressed to Kyko’s Ontario

    whether a defendant has discharged its burden of showing why jurisdiction
    should be declined to displace the forum chosen by the plaintiff is the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge concluded that this factor was
    neutral in this case. This ground of appeal arises out of the underlined
    portion of the passage below from the motion judge’s reasons addressing the
    comparative convenience and expense for the witnesses:  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[51] Similarly, I find that the comparative convenience and
    expense for the witnesses is largely neutral in this matter. Kyko’s witnesses,
    including Mr. Kulkarni and Ms. Thomas, are in Ontario. Sanjay Asher, Ms. Batra
    and Yogesh Asher, are located in Mumbai. Mr. Rajappan and Mr. Sundar purportedly
    signed the Guarantee for Sical, but it is unknown if they are in India,
    Singapore or elsewhere. The Defendants may call others from Sical to testify,
    but do not know whether anyone at Sical has anything relevant to say and, if
    so, who or where they are. The Defendants may call a police witness from
    Chennai, located about 1,300 km from Mumbai, to testify about the forgery investigation.
    They also submit that Amit Punde, Kyko’s former representative in Pune, may be a
    witness, although Mr. Punde did not witness any relevant events and can only
    give second-hand information about the forgery investigation, which the police
    witness likely will address. <span class=Underline>As the </span><span
class=Underline>Defendants gave little or no information as to what their
    witnesses will say, apart from Sanjay </span><span class=Underline>Asher and
    Ms. Batra, I am persuaded to treat their proposed list of witnesses with
    caution: </span><span class=EmphasisUnderlineChar>Goldhar</span><span
class=Underline> </span><span class=Underline>at para 57</span>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[52] Should a party or witness outside of Ontario not wish to
    travel to Brampton for any part of this proceeding, Kyko has undertaken to
    consent to their attendance by videoconferencing, which is how the parties
    conducted cross-examinations on the affidavits for this motion. The Defendants did
    not object to video testimony and led no evidence to suggest that any of its
    witnesses would not agree to testify by video. As a result, I find that video
    technology may offer a fair, convenient, and cost-effective way to obtain
    testimony from witnesses abroad at trial in Ontario: <em>Davies v. </em><em>Clarington</em>,
    2015 ONSC 7353 at paras 23-28. In contrast, there was no evidence of whether
    video evidence is permitted by the High Court of Bombay. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the motion judge relied on a passage in the decision of
    the motion judge in <em>Goldhar</em> that Côté J. overruled when the decision
    was appealed to the Supreme Court. She held at para. 67 that the motion judge
    had</p>
  <p class=CQuote>erred by unreasonably discounting [the defendant] Haaretz’s
    proposed witnesses and the relevance of their evidence. Haaretz had, in its
    factum, described what these 22 witnesses “may speak to” and had filed a
    supplemental affidavit briefly describing the evidence that 8 of the witnesses
    might give to assist it at trial. Goldhar had, in comparison, no evidence
    concerning the witnesses he might call and what those witnesses would speak to. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Côté
    J. described the motion judge’s error as involving “a complete misapprehension
    of, or failure to consider, material evidence” (at para. 50), and the motion
    judge’s conclusion regarding the comparative convenience and expense for the
    witnesses as “wholly unreasonable” in light of the evidence before him (at
    para. 55.) She concluded that this factor heavily favoured the forum proposed
    by the defendant (Israel). She also held that the motion judge erred in giving
    weight to the notion of having the Israeli witnesses (many of whom were
    reluctant) testify by videoconference, since there was no evidence that an
    Ontario court could compel them to do so. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that they, like the defendant Haaretz in <em>Goldhar</em>,
    provided a list of their proposed witnesses and a brief description of what
    some of them would speak to, and the motion judge therefore erred in treating
    their witness list “with caution”. They say this led the motion judge to
    erroneously conclude that the factor of comparative inconvenience for the
    witnesses was neutral. They submit that the motion judge’s error is not “saved”
    by his observation that videoconferencing may be an option for witnesses from
    outside of Ontario. They point to what they say are the inherent frailties of
    testifying by videoconference. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the motion judge in this case erred in citing to the overruled passage in <em>Goldhar</em>,
    I am not persuaded that this warrants interference by this court. The
    appellants do not impugn any of the motion judge’s findings of fact in the
    passages reproduced above. The motion judge acknowledged that the appellants
    had provided information about what some of their witnesses (Mr. Asher and Ms.
    Batra) will say. Unlike Haaretz in <em>Goldhar</em>, however, Mr. Asher could
    not say what, if any relevant evidence the other witnesses might be able to
    provide. The motion judge in this case, therefore, unlike the motion judge in <em>Goldhar</em>,
    did not misapprehend the evidence and his conclusion was reasonable. His error
    in citing to <em>Goldhar</em> did not lead him to conclude that the factor of
    comparative inconvenience to witnesses was “largely neutral.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    while I appreciate that there is a 9½-hour time difference between Ontario and
    Mumbai, the appellants have not demonstrated any error in principle concerning
    the motion judge’s observation that videoconferencing technology may offer a
    fair, convenient and cost-effective way to obtain testimony from witnesses
    abroad at trial in Ontario. It is open to an Ontario court to modify its usual
    sitting hours to better accommodate an out-of-country witness. Even before the COVID-19
    pandemic made videoconferencing software ubiquitous, Canadian courts have considered
    the possibility of proceeding electronically as part of the <em>forum non
    conveniens </em>analysis: <em>Tyco </em>at para. 52; <em>Henry Estate v. Henry</em>,
    2012 MBCA 4, 275 Man. R. (2d) 90, at paras. 54-57. The motion judge in this
    case did not fall into the error in <em>Goldhar</em>. Unlike Haaretz, the
    appellants did not adduce evidence that their witnesses in India would not testify
    voluntarily. The motion judge did not<em> </em>rely on videoconferencing to
    overcome the problem of foreign witnesses who are unwilling to testify, in the
    absence of evidence that those witnesses could be compelled in Ontario.</p>

lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning to the third and fourth factors
    (desirability of avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting decisions),
    the appellants say that given that the Madras High Court will consider whether
    the guarantee is a forgery, it would be “eminently reasonable” for the Madras
    High Court to also determine the issues raised in Kyko’s action. The motion
    judge’s conclusion that these factors were neutral is accordingly unreasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I disagree. The motion judge specifically
    recognized that the Madras High Court is to consider whether the guarantee is a
    forgery, which will overlap with Kyko’s claims against the appellants. He noted,
    however, that neither party viewed the Madras High Court as an appropriate or
    convenient forum: the appellants submitted that the High Court of Bombay in
    Mumbai was the convenient forum. He held that there was no evidence on this
    motion to suggest that having this proceeding heard in Mumbai would lead to any
    ongoing efficiencies with the ongoing matter in the Madras High Court or
    mitigate the multiplicity of proceedings. There was no indication that the
    parties or claims in the matter before the Madras High Court could be
    consolidated with Kyko’s action against the appellants if it were heard before
    the High Court of Bombay and it seemed likely that the litigation in Chennai
    will continue as a separate proceeding, whether Kyko’s claim is heard in Mumbai
    or Ontario. Nor was there any suggestion that having Kyko’s claim heard in
    Mumbai would result in procedural efficiencies with litigation in Chennai by
    allowing common records, productions or other evidence to be shared in both
    proceedings, or by allowing any appeals from the proceeding to be joined or
    heard in tandem. Further, whichever court hears Kyko’s claim – whether in
    Ontario or Mumbai – will likely have to consider the risk of a conflicting
    decision in the Madras High Court proceedings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, the appellants attempt to re-cast
    their position before the motion judge, submitting that the Madras High Court
    is the clearly more convenient forum. However, Mr. Asher’s evidence was that
    Kyko’s action should be heard in Bombay. The motion judge’s conclusion that the
    third and fourth factors are neutral is reasonable.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the sixth factor, the appellants argue that an Indian court is
    clearly in a better position to dispose fairly and efficiently of the
    litigation. Indeed, they say it is unfair to require an Indian law firm and
    lawyer who provided an opinion about the enforceability in India of a guarantee
    given by an Indian company to an Ontario company which carried on business in
    India to defend an action in Ontario arising out of their provision of that
    guarantee. They say this case is different from <em>Sincies Chiementin S.p.A.
    (Trustee of) v. King</em>, 2012 ONCA 653, leave to appeal refused, [2012]
    S.C.C.A. No. 516, on which the motion judge relied, in concluding that it was
    fair for the appellants to be called to account in Ontario. Mr. Asher is a
    lawyer in a regional law firm in India, not a lawyer who specializes in
    international business law like the lawyer in <em>Sincies</em>. Further, they say
    that the motion judge leant instinctively in favour of his own jurisdiction,
    which <em>Van Breda</em>, at para. 112, cautions against. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge instructed himself that, having
    regard to the case as a whole, he “must consider and balance the broader issues
    of fairness and efficiency of a particular forum with the justice of that
    choice to the parties”. He found himself unable to assess the juridical
    advantage factor, and the appellants do not fault that finding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He concluded that overall fairness
    considerations favoured Ontario. In his view, this case was like </span><em>Sincies </em><span lang=EN-US>because, like the lawyer in that case, the appellants
    “are sophisticated legal professionals who advised Kyko, an Ontario corporate
    client, knowing that it would receive and act upon the advice in the forum.” It
    would therefore be fair for the appellants to account for their conduct in
    Ontario. The motion judge held that the appellants had not shown that the High
    Court of Bombay would be a substantially less inconvenient and expensive forum. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, that conclusion is reasonable. Whether
    or not Mr. Asher specialized in international business law, the appellants are
    one of India’s oldest law firms and a senior partner at that firm. As the
    motion judge found, they are sophisticated legal professionals who advised an
    Ontario corporation, and there was a good arguable case that the opinion was
    first provided to Kyko in Ontario and relied upon there. The motion judge’s
    analysis was rigorous and much more than an instinctive favouring of his own
    jurisdiction. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal, with costs to Kyko in the
    all-inclusive amount of $20,000.</p>
