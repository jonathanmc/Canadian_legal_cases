  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>O.K.S. appeals his convictions for sexual assault and assault. Without
    providing an exhaustive list of the complaints made, the appellant says that
    the trial judge relied on stereotypical beliefs; misapprehended the evidence;
    failed to properly consider inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence; and
    applied an unequal standard of scrutiny of the evidence. At the conclusion of
    the hearing, we dismissed the appeal with reasons to follow. We now provide our
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and the complainant were married. There were no children. They
    had contrasting views of the state of their marriage at the time of the
    incident that gave rise to the charges. The complainant said that the marriage
    was an unhappy one. She accused the appellant of having affairs. She also
    admitted to having an affair herself. The complainant said that the only reason
    she remained in the relationship was because she was the sponsor for the
    appellant with respect to his immigration status in Canada.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the appellant says that the marriage was a happy one. He said
    that any issues in the marriage arose from the complainant’s drinking, which
    she tended to do to excess. The affair that the complainant engaged in, which
    she originally denied, was also a recent source of stress.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The incident that led to the charges began with the appellant and the
    complainant going out to a bar. They returned home and began having sex. The
    complainant said that the appellant became angry with her when the complainant
    made a comment about his performance. The complainant says that the appellant
    struck her. He also demanded her phone which he eventually smashed. The
    contents of her phone were believed by the appellant to tie back into the
    complainant’s affair which the appellant realized had, in fact, occurred. The
    complainant says that the appellant then forced her to have sexual intercourse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s version of the incident was different. He agreed that,
    at the outset, they had consensual sex. However, the appellant says that he
    became upset when the complainant suggested engaging in a sex act that he was
    not interested in. This suggestion caused the appellant to become suspicious
    about whether the complainant had, in fact, had an affair. He demanded to see
    her iPad which the complainant opened for him after the appellant said he would
    break it if she did not. The appellant found messages with another man. He
    became upset and punched the wall. The appellant then told the complainant that
    he was leaving.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was left with the task of resolving these competing descriptions
    of the events. In his reasons, he properly set out the test from <em>R. v. W.
    (D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. The trial judge was aware that, in order to
    convict the appellant, he needed not only not to believe the appellant’s
    evidence but also find that it did not raise a reasonable doubt. He then had to
    accept that the complainant’s evidence established the guilt of the appellant
    beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of the criticisms made by the appellant with respect to the trial
    judge’s analysis and conclusion are made out on the record before us. The trial
    judge gave thorough and careful reasons in which he reviewed the evidence in
    detail. He found that he did not believe the appellant and that his evidence
    did not raise a reasonable doubt, and he gave a number of reasons for that
    conclusion. The trial judge did not engage in any stereotypical assumptions in
    reaching his conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then proceeded to consider and accept the complainant’s
    evidence. He noted that her evidence was confirmed, at least in part, by
    photographs taken of her neck and face two days after the alleged assault. The
    trial judge also directly addressed the issues raised regarding the complainant’s
    evidence (largely allegations of inconsistencies) and found that those issues
    did not detract from her credibility and reliability. We do not see any basis
    for the assertion that the trial judge applied an unequal level of scrutiny to
    the evidence as between the appellant and the complainant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant essentially asks us to retry the case. That is not our
    role. The appellant must demonstrate that the trial judge either committed an
    error of law or made a palpable and overriding error of fact. He has failed to
    establish either.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is for these reasons that the appeal was dismissed.</p>
