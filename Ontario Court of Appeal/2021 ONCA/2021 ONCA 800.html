  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR
    DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals from convictions on four
    counts of sexual assault and one count of assault upon his wife. He argues that
    the trial judge erred in his assessment of the complainant’s credibility, erred
    in rejecting the appellant’s evidence and erred in his use of cross-count
    similar fact evidence. We do not accept these arguments and dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant and the complainant were married
    on April 19, 2015 in a traditional Punjabi arranged marriage. They had spent
    about 10 to 15 minutes together before both sets of parents agreed to the
    marriage. The complainant described an unremitting course of violent sexual and
    non-sexual assaults. Her every move was controlled and restricted, including
    the nature of her employment and the clothes she wore. She was not allowed any
    of the money she earned, her access to food was restricted and she was
    forbidden to use a cell phone to contact her own family. Police photographed
    the injuries to her body when she finally went to the police on the day she
    left the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In contrast, when questioned by police the
    appellant said it was a happy marriage and that there were no problems. He
    denied all of the assaults. At trial, the appellant’s position was that the
    allegations were ludicrous, that the complainant was lying, and that
    inconsistencies in her evidence showed that she could not keep her false
    stories straight. He largely admitted the degree of control exerted over the
    complainant’s daily activities. He testified at trial that their relationship
    had deteriorated, describing fights, arguments, and crying, and claimed that he
    decided to “let the complainant walk away from the marriage.”</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Principles governing appeals challenging a
    trial judge’s assessment of credibility</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A trial judge’s findings of credibility are owed
    deference. As recently noted by the SCC in </span><em>R. v. G.F.</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2021 SCC 2020, 459 D.L.R. (4th) 375 at para. 81: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>…a trial judge’s findings of credibility deserve particular
    deference. While the law requires some articulation of the reasons for those
    findings, it also recognizes that in our system of justice the trial judge is
    the fact finder and has the benefit of the intangible impact of conducting the
    trial. Sometimes, credibility findings are made simpler by, for example,
    objective, independent evidence. Corroborative evidence can support the finding
    of a lack of voluntary consent, but it is of course not required, nor always
    available. Frequently, particularly in a sexual assault case where the crime is
    often committed in private, there is little additional evidence, and
    articulating reasons for findings of credibility can be more challenging.
    Mindful of the presumption of innocence and the Crown’s burden to prove guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt, a trial judge strives to explain why a complainant
    is found to be credible, or why the accused is found not to be credible, or why
    the evidence does not raise a reasonable doubt. But, as this Court stated in<i> Gagnon</i>, at para. 20:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>Assessing credibility is not a
    science. It is very difficult for a trial judge to articulate with precision
    the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and
    listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of
    events.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is particularly so where the trial judge had the advantage of 24
    days of trial time and where the complainant was on the stand for over ten days,
    including 5.5 days of cross-examination. This trial judge was in a far better
    position to assess the credibility and reliability of the evidence than an
    appellate court reading a record. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Leaving the marriage with honour</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal the appellant submits that the trial
    judge did not assess the central plank of his defence: that the complainant had
    a motive to fabricate false allegations of assault, so that she could leave the
    marriage with honour, in accordance with her traditions. In general, the
    appellant’s thesis is that according to Punjabi traditions, unless the
    complainant could establish that the marriage was not consummated or that she
    had been subjected to physical abuse, she could not leave the marriage with
    honour, and this would make it difficult for her to remarry within those
    traditions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge questioned trial counsel as to
    whether he intended to call expert evidence to establish those traditions, and
    counsel responded that he did not intend to do so, but intended only to
    establish that the complainant and her own father adhered to those beliefs. The
    trial judge found that neither the complainant nor her father agreed with trial
    counsel’s suggestions as put to them in cross examination. This was a fair
    interpretation of their testimony. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found the complainant to be an
    honest witness, who did her best to tell the truth. He found that she held off
    reporting the abuse to her family and police for several months because she had
    a “sincere and honest belief, or perhaps hope, that things would change and
    placed her faith in the marriage arranged by her parents. She had already
    endured one failed marriage, and very likely had no desire to see her second
    marriage fail as well.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While the thesis of fabrication for the purposes
    of leaving the marriage with honour is emphasized on appeal, it had little
    prominence in submissions at trial. Trial counsel devoted only a couple of
    lines in otherwise lengthy submissions to the issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We see no basis to interfere with the trial
    judge’s conclusion that the complainant was an honest witness. The trial judge
    did go on to acquit the appellant of a number of the other counts on the
    indictment, as he was not convinced that the appellant had accurately conveyed
    the substance of what had occurred on those other occasions. There was some
    confusion as to what happened during the incidents upon which the appellant was
    acquitted, in a context, that featured multiple – almost daily – assaults over
    the course of several months. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant’s evidence was powerfully
    corroborated by the photographs of her injuries, which she attributed to the
    appellant. Her evidence was detailed, graphic and compelling.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Did the trial judge err in rejecting the
    appellant’s evidence?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in relying on his controlling behaviour and his attitude towards his wife to
    reject his testimony that the assaults did not occur. While he may have been a
    verbally abusive, uncaring and inattentive husband, this does not mean that he
    assaulted his wife. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The difficulty with this submission is that the
    ongoing assaults were part of the pattern of domination and control used to
    keep the complainant under the appellant’s and his parents’ thumbs.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge noted “despite his testimony
    that he wanted his marriage to work, and was interested in making it a
    successful relationship, during most of his testimony R.G. seemed dismissive,
    nonchalant, aloof, arrogant and not genuine. Not only did he show little
    interest for the complainant, his testimony confirmed that little interest in
    her existed throughout the course of their marriage.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Again, as the trial judge noted, the photographs
    of the complainant’s injuries, for which there was no other credible
    explanation, provided good reason to reject the appellant’s evidence. The lies
    the appellant told police regarding matters inconsistent with his trial

    marriage, although she had really wanted the marriage to work, supports her

    the conditions in that household were truly intolerable. </span></p>

    abusive conduct towards a single complainant may be admitted as proof of animus
    or to establish the nature of the relationship between the parties. He submits,
    however, that the trial judge erred by engaging in prohibited propensity
    reasoning by concluding that the trial judge reasoned that because the
    appellant committed one assault, he was likely to have committed another. We
    are not convinced that the trial judge engaged in this line of reasoning, but
    in any event, as this court observed in </span><em>R. v. Batte</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 49 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.) at para. 102: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>For example, if an accused is
    charged with assaulting his wife, evidence that the accused beat his wife on a
    regular basis throughout their long marriage would be admissible. Evidence of
    the prior beatings does much more than suggest that the accused is a bad person
    or that the accused has a general disposition to act violently and commit
    assaults. The evidence suggests a strong disposition to do the very act in issue
    – assault his wife.  In such cases, the jury is permitted to reason, assuming
    it accepts the evidence of the prior assaults, that the accused was disposed to
    act violently towards his wife and that he had that disposition on the occasion
    in issue.</p>
