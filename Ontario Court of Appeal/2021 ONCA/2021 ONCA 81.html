    referred to as “Auntie”. Based on the content and context of the calls, it was
    possible that “Auntie” referred to Mr. Kayem, and that the conversations were
    about how to keep Mr. Kayem, who had travelled to Dubai after the murder, from
    returning to Canada.</span></p>

    using the passport matter as an opportunity to invite the appellant to discuss
    the death of Mr. Zalal. While at the time, the appellant was not a suspect, he
    was a known associate of Mr. Zalal.  Detective Hill took contemporaneous notes

    Crown brought an application to have the appellant’s statement to Detective
    Hill admitted as voluntary: <em>R. v. Al-Enzi</em>, 2016 ONSC 3574
    (“Voluntariness Reasons”). The Crown sought to use the statement as evidence
    that the appellant had deliberately lied to conceal his guilt. The appellant
    challenged the application, arguing, among other things, that the statement
    should not be admitted on the basis that it had limited probative value. </span></p>

    appellant, the statement served no purpose other than to memorialize the
    alleged falsehood that he had been at a bar in Québec on the night of August
    18. Even if the statement was proven false, its falsity could not be used to
    further the Crown’s case, as a falsehood cannot be used to support an inference
    that an accused deliberately lied to conceal their guilt, absent independent
    evidence of fabrication. In support of this proposition, the appellant referred
    to this court’s decision in <em>R. v. O’Connor</em> (2002), 170 C.C.C. (3d) 365
    (Ont. C.A.). </span></p>

    that, while such independent evidence would potentially be available in the
    form of the anticipated evidence of Mr. Kayem and Mr. Abdul-Hussein (who both
    claimed that the appellant had murdered Mr. Zalal), acceptance of that evidence
    would effectively render the appellant’s concoction inconsequential (as the jury
    would already have accepted that he murdered Mr.&nbsp;Zalal). The evidence thus
    served no purpose. </span></p>

    indicated that he could “live with” the instruction. Crown counsel, however,
    opposed the use of the word “narrative”, arguing instead that it should be

    consider the Crown’s submission. </span></p>

    is a well-established distinction between an exculpatory statement by an
    accused that is disbelieved, and one that is determined to have been fabricated
    or concocted to avoid culpability: <em>R. v. Wright</em>, 2017 ONCA 560, 354
    C.C.C. (3d) 377, at para. 38. The importance of this distinction lies in the
    fact that, while a statement that “is merely disbelieved is not evidence that
    strengthens the Crown’s case”, a statement that has been deliberately concocted
    can be capable of supporting an inference of guilt: <em>O’Connor;</em> at para.
    38. In other words, where the Crown can prove that an accused’s exculpatory
    statement was not simply untrue, but an intentional fabrication, the trier of
    fact is entitled to draw an inference that the accused lied to conceal their
    guilt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    prove an intentional fabrication, the Crown must adduce evidence of that
    fabrication, independent of the evidence that contradicts or discredits the
    exculpatory statement: <em>Wright</em>, at paras. 40-41; <em>O’Connor</em>, at
    paras. 21-22; <em>R. v. Laliberté</em>, 2016 SCC 17, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 270, at
    paras. 3-4. Put differently, the Crown must not only adduce evidence that
    disproves the exculpatory statement, but also adduce independent evidence that proves
    that the exculpatory statement was made for the purpose of deflecting guilt
    from the accused. This point was also recently made by this court in the case
    of <em>R. v. Ching</em>, 2019 ONCA 619, 378 C.C.C. (3d) 284, at para. 47, where
    the court stated: “<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Independent
    evidence of concoction can, however, be found in the very content of the
    impugned statements, depending on the context in which they were made.
    Independent, in this sense, means that the evidence of concoction is separate
    from the evidence of guilt, not necessarily separate from the statements
    themselves.</span></strong> For example, where an accused has made
    contradictory exculpatory statements, the self-contradiction of an accused may
    constitute independent evidence of fabrication: see&nbsp;<em>R. v. Shafia</em>,
    2016 ONCA 812, 341 C.C.C. (3d) 354, at para. 288, leave to appeal refused,
    [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 17.” This requirement ensures that the Crown is made to
    prove an accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and that mere disbelief of
    an accused does not automatically lead to a guilty verdict: <em>O’Connor</em>,
    at para. 20, citing <em>R. v. Coutts</em> (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont.
    C.A.), at pp. 551-552, leave to appeal refused, [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 450.</span></p>

    is made out of court, independent evidence of fabrication may emerge from the
    evidence of the circumstances in which the statement was made. Such evidence
    will necessarily be case and fact specific. Some examples of such evidence are
    “pre-arrest exculpatory statements that are specific and detailed” or
    “post-arrest statements that are inherently implausible”: <em>Wright</em>, at

    to, disbelieve the accused’s exculpatory statement; </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>3) if, on the basis of the independent
    evidence, they do not find that the accused fabricated the statement, they must
    ignore the statement and treat it as if it had never been given; </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>4) by contrast, if they do find that the
    accused fabricated the statement, they may consider the reason why the accused

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Appellate review of the adequacy of a jury
    instruction requires a functional assessment. <span class=Underline>The court
    asks whether the charge, read as a whole in the context of the specific case,
    properly equipped the jury to decide the case based on the application of the
    applicable legal principles to the evidence.</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The context of the case includes <span
class=Underline>the evidence, the positions of the parties, the closing
    arguments, the submissions of counsel in advance of the charge, and any
    objections</span> taken to the charge. [Emphasis added; citations omitted]</span></p>

    recognized that the failure of a trial judge to outline for the jury the
    circumstances supporting a finding of fabrication may inure to the benefit of
    the accused. This point was made in <em>Polimac</em>, at para. 106:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[A]n instruction that highlighted the
    circumstances that would support a finding of fabrication were the jury to find

    arising from a trier of fact’s confusion of mere disbelief with affirmative
    evidence of guilt underscores the law in this area. However, this risk is
    lessened where the statement to be adduced is an out-of-court statement of the
    accused, as compared to the accused’s in-court testimony. O’Connor A.C.J.O.,
    writing for this court in <em>O’Connor</em>, described this distinction at
    para. 25:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When an out-of-court statement of an accused
    is introduced into evidence it does not have the same immediate connection to
    the trial itself as an accused's testimony and for that reason, even if shown
    to be false, it does not present the same threat that the trier of fact will
    confuse mere disbelief with affirmative evidence of guilt and improperly lessen
    the burden on the Crown.</span></p>

    judge had indicated that she had found that there was no independent evidence
    of fabrication, she ought to have instructed the jury that the alibi, if
    disbelieved, had no probative value and was simply part of the narrative. The
    instruction that the statement was “just one piece of evidence to be considered
    with all the other evidence” invited the jury to draw the improper inference
    that the appellant’s lie was indicative of a consciousness of guilt. The
    instruction thus invited the very mischief that was to be avoided. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    in fact, independent evidence of fabrication, the instruction failed to provide
    the jury with the necessary tools to assess that evidence and determine whether
    they could find that the appellant had deliberately lied to conceal a
    consciousness of guilt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    argues that the circumstances in which the appellant made the statement to
    Detective Hill provided independent evidence of fabrication. In light of this
    evidence, it would have been appropriate for the trial judge to provide an
    instruction regarding the proper use of this evidence. However, in this case, the
    absence of an instruction did not cause prejudice. </span></p>

    consider whether there was independent evidence of fabrication capable of
    supporting an inference of the accused’s consciousness of his guilt. In my
    view, there was. Accordingly, I conclude that the trial judge erred in
    determining otherwise.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>In reaching this
    conclusion, I consider the circumstances of the appellant’s exculpatory
    out-of-court statement. I note that this court’s description of the
    circumstances providing independent evidence of fabrication in <em>O’Connor</em>,
    at para.&nbsp;31,<em> </em>are apposite: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>His first statement was made the same day as
    the shooting and, importantly, <span class=Underline>was made to the police at
    a time when the police did not suspect the appellant </span>and the appellant
    did not have reason to believe that he was a suspect. The police, as a matter
    of routine, questioned witnesses who might have information about the
    deceased's whereabouts prior to the shooting. The appellant's initial statement
    furnished a complete alibi and if true, <span class=Underline>would lead the
    police to conclude that he was not involved in the offence</span>. That
    statement and the next two statements were <span class=Underline>very precise,
    both as to the appellant's whereabouts and the times he was in the various
    places.</span> If the jury were to disbelieve the appellant's statements, they
    might fairly ask why would the appellant tell such <span class=Underline>detailed
    and specific lies</span> to the investigators. Why not tell the truth? And how
    was it that the <span class=Underline>appellant was so well prepared with a
    detailed and precise statement</span> about his whereabouts when questioned by
    the police? [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>I conclude that the
    circumstances of the appellant’s statement to the police constitute independent
    evidence of fabrication. As in <em>O’Connor</em>, the appellant provided his
    statement to Detective Hill shortly after the shooting, at a time when he was
    not a suspect. The appellant’s statement was detailed and precise with respect
    to the appellant’s whereabouts and timing. The appellant volunteered this
    information without any prompting, and if believed, the information would
    deflect suspicion away from him. These circumstances, taken together, could
    reasonably constitute independent evidence of fabrication.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>Given the overt
    similarities between the circumstances arguably giving rise to independent
    evidence of fabrication in this case and <em>O’Connor</em>, I conclude that the
    trial judge erred in law in her understanding of what circumstances can give
    rise to such evidence. Applying the appropriate understanding of the law to
    this case, it is clear that there was evidence that arguably constituted
    independent evidence of fabrication. This, however, does not end the analysis.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Trial Judge’s Instruction Did Not Prejudice the Appellant</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    concluded that there was no independent evidence of fabrication and should have
    instructed the jury that if they disbelieved the accused’s evidence, they
    should disregard it. This did not occur. However, any resulting prejudice is
    lessened by the circumstances I have discussed demonstrating independent
    evidence of fabrication.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>As independent evidence
    of fabrication existed, the trial judge should have provided an instruction for
    the jury outlining the evidence that supported such a finding. The trial judge
    did not do so. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>As I have indicated, however,
    the question on appeal is not whether the trial judge should have given such an
    instruction, but whether the trial judge’s failure to do so prejudiced the
    appellant’s right to a fair trial: <em>Polimac</em>, at para. 106. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>I conclude that the
    trial judge’s instruction did not prejudice the appellant. To the contrary, and
    similar to <em>Polimac</em>, the trial judge’s failure to outline the
    independent evidence of fabrication may have inured to the appellant’s benefit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>I first consider
    whether the trial judge’s approach to the jury instruction on this issue prejudiced
    the appellant. I note that, unlike in <em>Polimac</em> (see para. 94 of that
    case), defence counsel in this case asked for an <em>O’Connor </em>warning if
    the trial judge found independent evidence of fabrication. As the trial judge
    concluded that no such independent evidence existed, defence counsel was
    essentially deprived of any potential benefit of their requested instruction. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>Similarly, I note that
    defence counsel agreed to a specific version of the draft charge when the trial
    judge’s proposed charge was circulated to counsel. This draft included the
    statement that the evidence was “part of the narrative for you to consider
    along with the rest of the evidence”. The version that was given, however, did
    not include this language, instead stating that it was “one piece of evidence
    to be considered with all the other evidence”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>In my view, any
    prejudice arising from the trial judge’s approach was mitigated by various
    factors. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>First, despite the
    appellant’s argument on appeal that the trial judge ought to have instructed
    the jury that the alibi, if disbelieved, had no probative value, defence
    counsel at trial resiled from this position. Instead, trial defence counsel
    agreed to the proposed charge stating: “In all the circumstances this evidence
    is part of the narrative for you to consider along with the rest of the
    evidence.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>Furthermore, and more
    importantly, the trial judge’s failure to outline the circumstances supporting
    independent evidence of fabrication may have inured to the appellant’s benefit.
    This instruction would have focused the trier of fact’s attention on the
    circumstances supporting a strong inference of fabrication. An instruction
    highlighting the circumstances supporting a finding of fabrication “may well
    have only emphasized the powerful case to be made for fabrication in the
    circumstances of this case”: <em>Polimac, </em>at para. 106.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the trial judge’s instructions to the jury otherwise equipped the jury with the
    tools necessary to assess the importance, or lack thereof, of the appellant’s
    disbelieved evidence. In this respect, the trial judge instructed the jury to
    “keep in mind that people sometimes lie for entirely innocent reasons” when
    assessing the appellant’s evidence that he was at the Cosmos Bar at the
    relevant time. The trial judge then referenced the testimony of multiple trial
    witnesses who were “involved in the criminal subculture”, reminding the jury that
    “[t]hey all testified that they typically lie to the police when questioned
    about any matter.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    instructions made clear to the jury that the simple presence of a lie did not
    necessarily give rise to a consciousness of guilt by the appellant. “While the
    safer course would have been to include” a more precise<em> </em>instruction, I
    “cannot say that the manner in which this issue was left with the jury
    undermined the appellant’s right to a fair trial”: <em>Zekarias</em>, at para.
    21.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    I conclude that the trial judge’s failure to provide the <em>O’Connor </em>instruction
    did not prejudice the appellant. Accordingly, I would dismiss this ground of
    appeal. </span></p>

    August 22, 2006, the appellant had a telephone conversation with Detective Hill
    in which he provided details about his contact with Mr. Zalal on August 18. The
    appellant attended the police station the next day to retrieve his passport. He
    reiterated that he had no information about the events of Mr. Zalal’s death. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>A few months later,
    Sergeant Michael Hudson contacted the appellant for an interview. The appellant
    agreed, and on November 8, 2006, he attended the Ottawa police station to give
    a statement. The interview, conducted by Detective John Monette, was
    video-taped and recorded. The appellant acknowledged that he was there
    voluntarily. He was informed that he was not a suspect and that he was free to
    leave at any time. The appellant maintained a story consistent with the
    statement he had given to Detective Hill on August 22. He eventually indicated
    that he had nothing more to say.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    station, however, the appellant agreed to speak to Sergeant Hudson about
    something that the appellant had told him on the phone the night before – the appellant
    had stated, “Mike, they are going to kill me”. The appellant proceeded to speak
    with Sergeant Hudson in a second interview room without cameras. Sergeant
    Hudson brought a small audio recorder into the room and surreptitiously
    recorded the conversation. Sergeant Hudson expressed concern for the
    appellant’s safety and mentioned the possibility of the appellant serving as a
    witness or confidential informant. The appellant stated that he would consider
    the proposal. He then left.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    to trial, the Crown brought an application to admit the appellant’s statements
    to police as voluntary. The appellant opposed the application. He argued that the
    record of the August 22 statement was incomplete and that he had been induced
    to make the statement in exchange for his passport. He also argued that the
    statement’s probative value (the potential falsehood that he attended the bar
    on August 18) was outweighed by its prejudicial effect (that his refusal to
    cooperate would indicate guilt). The November 8 statements were similarly
    involuntary, as, among other things, they were tainted by the inadmissible
    statement on August 22 and the appellant had been misled about his status in
    the investigation.</span></p>

    the Crown’s application, admitting the statements as voluntary. There was no
    evidence that Detective Hill threatened to withhold the appellant’s passport
    unless he gave a statement. In fact, the evidence showed the opposite, as
    Detective Hill returned the passport in spite of the appellant’s refusal to
    provide a statement. Although there was no recording of the phone call,
    Detective Hill’s notes were detailed enough to provide adequate clarity as to
    the nature of the conversation that took place. The ultimate reliability of
    Detective Hill’s evidence could be assessed by the jury. Any potential
    prejudice could be addressed by way of instruction, and the jury was entitled
    to consider whether the appellant gave a deliberately false statement. With
    regard to the November 8 statements, there was no tainting and, while there was
    some evidence at the time to implicate the appellant in the murder, Detective
    Monette and Sergeant Hudson’s actions demonstrated that he was not a suspect.</span></p>

    effectively makes four arguments on appeal. First, as the record provided by
    Detective Hill is not a verbatim record of the phone conversation, the court
    cannot be satisfied that Detective Hill did not hold out the return of the
    passport as an inducement for the statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    August 22 statement was voluntary, it should not have been admitted, as its
    prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. A trier of fact can only find
    that an accused deliberately lied where there is independent evidence of
    fabrication above and beyond a simple finding that the accused’s alibi is
    false. In this case, no such independent evidence was available. The
    prejudicial effect, however, was significant. Admission of the statement
    created a real risk that jurors would presume that only a guilty person would
    lie to police. </span></p>

    Freedoms </em>were breached when he was not provided his rights to counsel
    prior to the November 8 interviews. Since the appellant was objectively a
    suspect at that point in time (given that investigative documents identified
    him as a possible suspect), the police failed to make clear his level of
    jeopardy. </span></p>

    and the trial judge should have considered this under her residual discretion
    to exclude evidence. However, as this argument was abandoned at the hearing, I
    will not address it. </span></p>

    telephone call; ii) the trial judge was correct not to exclude the statements
    on the basis of her residual discretion to exclude evidence; iii) even if the
    August 22 statement was involuntary and, thus, inadmissible, there was no
    connection between the August 22 interview and the November 8 interviews; and iv)

    assessment of necessity by misapprehending the extent of the witness’ lack of
    memory. While Mr. Khaleyi did profess a lack of memory on some aspects of his
    former testimony, he did testify about other aspects, including his encounter
    with the appellant on the evening of the murder, and about a threat allegedly
    made by the appellant. Accordingly, there was no need for the witness’ prior

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>Second, the trial judge

    statement lacked sufficient circumstantial or evidentiary guarantees of
    reliability, as the corroborative evidence adduced by the Crown did not
    eliminate alternative explanations for the statement, such as the declarant not
    being truthful. </span></p>

    witness” who was motivated by a desire for financial compensation and
    assistance with criminal charges, as well as animosity toward the appellant. As
    Mr.&nbsp;Khaleyi’s evidence was not adequately corroborated, there was a real
    risk of a wrongful conviction based on his flawed testimony: <em>R. v. Khela, </em>2009
    SCC 4, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104, at para. 2. Since the alleged confession was
    central to the Crown’s case, the trial judge should have noted the risk that
    the jury would be unable to see past the allegation of the confession and thus
    be unable to properly assess Mr. Khaleyi’s credibility. The verdict may have

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I am satisfied that the trial judge correctly admitted Mr. Khaleyi’s
    May 4, 2007 statement. As I will explain, it met the necessity and reliability
    requirements under the principled exception to the hearsay rule. Furthermore,
    the trial judge was correct not to use her residual discretion to exclude the
    statement, given its significant probative value. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>At trial, Mr. Khaleyi effectively recanted much of what he had told
    the police. He repeatedly claimed that he had a limited memory of his
    interactions with police and refused to adopt the content of his earlier
    statements as true. He provided several explanations as to why his evidence
    differed from his statements, including how he: was using drugs heavily,
    including when he heard the alleged confession; was suffering from mental
    health issues; suffered from hearing loss, which likely impacted his earlier
    belief that he heard the appellant confess; was manipulated by the police;
    wanted assistance with his charges; and wanted money for his evidence. He commented
    that reviewing transcripts of his past statements was unlikely to refresh his
    memory. Ultimately, he stated that he could not now swear under oath that he
    heard the appellant confess to the murder. These circumstances formed the
    context in which the Crown sought to adduce the May 4 statement for the truth
    of its contents. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge, as the evidentiary gate keeper, was obliged to
    satisfy herself that the May 4 statement satisfied the threshold admissibility
    requirements before it could be admitted for its truth. Once admitted, it could
    then be considered by the jury, who as the triers of fact, were responsible for
    the determination of the ultimate reliability and consideration of the
    statement. In my view, the trial judge correctly carried out her function. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, the necessity criterion was satisfied. By recanting from the
    statement, Mr. Khaleyi was effectively depriving the court of his evidence.
    This was sufficient to satisfy this requirement: <em>Youvaraj</em>, at para. 22; <em>McMorris</em>, at para. 22.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second, the reliability requirement was also met. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The statement was procedurally reliable. Both parties acknowledge
    that the May 4 statement was made under oath and video recorded in its
    entirety. Further, Mr. Khaleyi’s explanations for his statements and
    recantation were subject to cross-examination by the defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge was wrong to rely on Mr.
    Khaleyi’s availability for cross-examination as an indicium of procedural
    reliability in this case. I do not agree. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While Mr. Khaleyi offered multiple explanations for his changed
    testimony, I do not consider this as having rendered the cross-examination a
    nullity. In this regard, I note that Mr. Khaleyi generally admitted to making
    the prior statement and provided explanations for changing his testimony. As
    noted earlier, he claimed he made the past statements because he: was using
    drugs; had mental health issues; was manipulated by the police; wanted
    assistance with other charges; and wanted money for his information. Defence
    counsel cross examined Mr. Khaleyi on these explanations. Where a witness
    provides explanations for their changed testimony, the trier of fact is able to
    assess both versions of their story and the explanation: <em>Youvaraj, </em>at
    para. 49, citing <em>R. v. U. (F. J.)</em>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764, at para. 46.
    In my view, the defence had a full opportunity to cross examine Mr.&nbsp;Khaleyi
    on these issues. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In conclusion, Mr. Khaleyi’s availability for cross-examination
    supports the May 4 statement’s procedural reliability. As the inquiry into
    threshold reliability is “not so focused on the question of whether there is
    reason to believe the statement is true, as it is on the question of whether
    the trier of fact will be in a position to rationally evaluate the evidence”, I
    conclude that the nature of Mr. Khaleyi’s changed testimony did not deprive the
    appellant of a meaningful opportunity for </span><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:100%'>cross-examination or undercut the statement’s
    procedural reliability: <em>Khelawon</em>, at para. 76. The trier of fact was
    positioned to evaluate the evidence, including Mr. Khaleyi’s explanations for
    his changed testimony. The May 4 statement was procedurally reliable.</span></p>

    the May 4 statement had certain markers of substantive reliability. The trial
    judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court’s reasons in <em>Bradshaw</em>.
    However, I note that certain material aspects of Mr. Khaleyi’s May 4 statement
    were corroborated by other pieces of evidence. The material points and their
    relevant corroborative evidence include:</span></p>

    evidentiary shortcomings, I conclude that the markers of procedural
    reliability, either alone or in tandem with the corroborative evidence and
    circumstances suggesting substantive reliability, are sufficient to demonstrate
    threshold reliability. The statement bore the traditional markers of procedural
    reliability. Mr. Khaleyi’s testimony at trial provided the defence with the
    opportunity to cross examine him and impeach the credibility of the May 4
    statement. Accordingly, the trial judge was correct to admit Mr. Khaleyi’s
    evidence and to leave an assessment of ultimate reliability to the trier of

    to have Mr. Zalal picked up under the pretence that he would have his firearm
    returned to him. After the appellant and his friends picked up Mr. Zalal, the

    had planned to kill Mr. Zalal, they could find that the appellant had kidnapped

    earlier written submissions, Crown counsel took the position that “this is a
    planned and deliberate first degree or nothing”: at para. 146. However, the
    trial judge added two other routes of liability during the course of the
    pre-charge conference. One additional route was constructive murder premised on
    kidnapping. In the Crown’s brief closing submissions on this path to first
    degree murder, Crown counsel “did not offer the jury a reason for a kidnapping
    other than to kill” the deceased: at para. 159. Brown J.A.’s finding meant
    that, “when viewed in context”, the error was “serious”: at para. 198. The
    trial judge had increased the number of routes of liability with “paths… not

    submissions would have therefore aided the jury in understanding how they could
    reject planning and deliberation, yet accept the Crown’s kidnapping theory. In
    this respect, I reproduce the relevant portions of the Crown’s closing address,
    where Crown counsel stated the following: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There’s another way of first degree murder,
    and that would involve a last minute shooting with the intent to kill by Nawaf
    Al-Enzi, <span class=Underline>but if you had some doubt that he actually
    intended to kill him until he got him into the car, but that he thought he was
    going to intimidate him, or rough him up, or let him know that Nawaf was boss
    but maybe let him live, and then decide at the last minute, “I’m going to shoot
    him,” once he gets him into the car, lured him away by fraud in order to do
    some harm to him, and then kidnapped by fraud</span> – so, kidnapping can
    happen by force, as we all – that’s what we usually think of, but kidnapping
    can happen by a lure or a fraud as well, that’s another way to kidnap someone. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>So, if Nawaf – if you find that Nawaf suckered
    Mohamed Zalal into that ride, why else is he separating him from his friends
    but that he has some evil intent, but if you’re not satisfied that he had
    formed the intent to kill until the last minute that’s still first degree. <span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown sought to introduce these conversations as evidence. They
    argued that, while the communications occurred while the appellant and Ms.&nbsp;Abdul-Hussein
    were married, any spousal privilege that may have attached to those
    communications was no longer in effect, as the appellant and his former wife were
    now divorced. </span></p>

    privilege was dictated by the nature of the relationship at the time of the
    communication, instead of the relationship status at the time the privilege is
    claimed. As the communications had occurred during the marriage, the privilege
    was still operative.</span></p>

    that, while the issue has not been definitively addressed, it “is clear from
    the jurisprudence that the legislative purpose of the spousal privilege is
    intended to ensure that marital harmony is preserved.” To extend spousal
    privilege to communications between former spouses after divorce would not
    accord with this legislative purpose, as there is no longer any marital harmony
    to protect. Therefore, since the appellant and Ms. Abdul-Hussein were no longer
    married, their communications were not privileged and could be admitted as
    evidence.</span></p>

    in <em>R. v.</em> <em>Rendon</em>, [1997] O.J. No. 5505 (Gen. Div.), the
    conclusion that spousal privilege dissolves upon the dissolution of marriage does
    not accord with the wording of s. 4(3) of the <em>Canada Evidence Act</em>. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In support of this argument, he points to the language in s. 4(3)
    that no husband or wife “is compellable to disclose any communication made … <span

    the appellant, this phrasing indicates that privilege extends to all
    communications made during the marriage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argues that, contrary to the conclusion of Sharpe
    J., extending the privilege beyond the period of marriage would promote and
    protect marital harmony. Society has an interest in former spouses maintaining
    harmonious relationships, including for the sake of any children. Further, as
    divorce is commonplace in modern society, the choice not to protect marital
    communications after divorce may undermine marital harmony by discouraging
    honest communication during the marriage. </span></p>

    does not attach to the communications, the trial judge erred in admitting them
    in light of the fact that the divorce was a direct result of the appellant’s
    first conviction. Under this argument, the admission of the communications continued
    the miscarriage of justice occasioned by the first trial. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Privilege is the right of a person or class of persons to exclude

  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>As a matter of
    principle, it is difficult to see why the privilege should survive the marriage</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>. The various decisions that have been cited indicate that the
    purposes of the privilege are the promotion of marital harmony and the
    prevention of the indignity of having one spouse testify against another. <span
class=Underline>Plainly, neither purpose is served once the marriage has been
    dissolved</span>. There is a clear trend in the case law, signalled in
    particular by the <em>Salituro</em> case, to limit the scope of evidential
    disability of spouses. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Principles Applied</span></h4>

lang=EN-CA>Spousal Privilege Under the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Canada

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[194]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I conclude that spousal testimonial privilege under s. 4(3) of the <em>Canada
    Evidence Act </em>does not survive divorce. I reach this conclusion by
    considering the statutory language in its entire context, in its grammatical
    and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the
    Act, and the intention of Parliament: <em>R. v. Gallone</em>, 2019 ONCA 663,
    147 O.R. (3d) 225, at para. 30, citing Ruth Sullivan, <em>Sullivan on the
    Construction of Statutes</em>, 6th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis, 2014), at p. 7. I
    place emphasis on both the plain language of the statute and the policy
    rationale underlying the privilege in reaching this conclusion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[195]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the intercepted communications between the appellant
    and Ms.&nbsp;Zeinab Abdul-Hussein were not privileged at the time of trial, as
    the two were no longer married. The trial judge did not err on this issue, nor
    in refusing to exercise her gatekeeper function to exclude this otherwise
    admissible evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[196]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The first source of my conclusion on the limitations of spousal
    privilege under s. 4(3) is the language of the statute itself. I reproduce it
    again for emphasis:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>No <span class=Underline>husband</span> is
    compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife <span
class=Underline>during their marriage</span>, and no <span class=Underline>wife</span> is compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband <span
class=Underline>during their marriage</span>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[197]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The plain language of this section does not support the appellant’s
    interpretation that the privilege survives divorce. Section 4(3) makes clear
    that the class of people who are not compellable to disclose marital
    communications are husbands and wives. This is distinct from the language describing
    what constitutes a marital communication, namely communications made during a
    marriage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[198]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I do not agree with the appellant’s argument that the language of
    “any communication made…during their marriage” exclusively governs the scope of
    the provision, such that the privilege attaches to any communication made
    during the marriage regardless of the marital status of the one claiming the
    privilege. This interpretation would deprive the references to “No husband” and
    “no wife” of meaning. Such an interpretation violates the presumption against
    tautology, according to which it is presumed that the legislature avoids
    superfluous or meaningless words. Instead, every word has a specific role to
    play in advancing the legislative purpose: <em>Canada (National Revenue) v.
    Thompson</em>, 2016 SCC 21, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 32; <em>Gallone</em>,
    at para. 31. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[199]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA> In my view, there are two relevant requirements in subsection 4(3):
    i) that the <span class=Underline>communication</span> is one that is made <span
class=Underline>during the marriage</span>; and ii) that the <span
class=Underline>person</span> claiming the privilege is, <span class=Underline>at
    the time of the claim</span>, a <span class=Underline>husband or wife</span>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[200]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I am also of the view that the appellant’s interpretation of this
    privilege does not meaningfully promote the relevant policy goals underlying
    the privilege. The appellant argues that extending spousal testimonial
    privilege to divorcees will promote and protect marital harmony. In <em>Salituro</em>,
    Iacobucci J. observed that “[s]ociety can have no interest in preserving
    marital harmony where spouses are irreconcilably separated because there is no
    marital harmony to be preserved”: at pp. 675-76. While it is arguable that
    Iacobucci J.’s comments apply to divorcees as well, I will nevertheless consider
    the parties’ arguments on this point. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[201]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, I agree with the respondent that extending this privilege to
    divorcees is inconsistent with the scope of communications protected by the
    privilege – namely, those made during the marriage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[202]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second, prior judicial treatment of the scope of the spousal incompetency
    rule demonstrates how the policy justification for the rule, as it then
    existed, disappeared in the context of divorced spouses and spouses with no
    reasonable prospect of reconciliation. As noted earlier, the protection of
    martial harmony and the avoidance of the natural repugnance resulting from one
    spouse testifying against another are purposes governing both spousal
    incompetency and privilege: <em>Nguyen</em>, at para. 20. In <em>Sallituro</em>,
    Iacobucci J. observed, during his analysis of spousal incompetency, that the
    “conclusion that a divorced spouse should not be a competent witness because of
    his or her former marital status is contrary to common sense”: <em>Salituro</em>,
    at p. 677. In his view, the policy justification for the spousal incompetency
    rule disappeared in the context of divorced or irreconcilably separated spouses,
    and he concluded that irreconcilably separated spouses were competent witnesses
    for the prosecution: <em>Salituro</em>, at pp. 671 and 677; see also <em>R.&nbsp;v.
    Nguyen</em>, 2010 ONSC 5843, 278 C.C.C. (3d) 490, at para. 18, aff’d 2015 ONCA
    278, 125 O.R. (3d) 321, leave to appeal refused, 2015 S.C.C.A No. 365. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[203]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As the policy goals underlying the spousal incompetency rule were
    said to disappear in the context of divorcees, I consider this relevant in
    determining whether these same policy goals warrant extending spousal privilege
    to that same group. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[204]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Third, I note that even if the privilege was extended to divorced
    spouses, it could still be waived by the recipient of the communication at any
    time. Extending the privilege to divorcees would not meaningfully address the
    risk raised by the appellant, namely that marital harmony will be undermined if
    the privilege did not apply to divorcees, as spouses cannot be certain, should
    they divorce, that their communication will remain confidential. This risk will
    still exist regardless of whether the privilege can be claimed by divorcees, as
    the recipient can always simply waive the privilege.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[205]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While I agree with the appellant that society’s interest in
    promoting harmony between spouses may not necessarily end with the dissolution
    of their marriage, I am of the view that extending the privilege to divorcees
    is a legal reform best left to the legislature. I am persuaded by Iacobucci J’s
    comments in <em>Salituro</em> on this point. I do not consider an
    interpretation of a statute that effectively amounts to a rewriting of it to be
    the kind of incremental change to the law that Iacobucci J. spoke of as
    permissible for courts to undertake: <em>Salituro</em>, at p. 670. Nor do I
    think reading into s. 4(3) the phrase ‘divorced spouse’ is necessary to keep
    the law in step with the dynamic and evolving fabric of our society: <em>Salituro</em>,
    at p. 670. This is particularly so, given the arguable legal trend away from
    recognizing spousal privilege at all, or at least not significantly expanding
    its scope: <em>R. v. Oland</em>, 2015 NBQB 247, 446 N.B.R. (2d) 317, at para.
    18, aff’d 2016 NBCA 58, leave to appeal refused, [2016] S.C.C.A. No. 188.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[206]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>My conclusion that the policy underlying the privilege does not
    justify the appellant’s interpretation is strengthened when I consider that
    this privilege does not apply to common-law spouses. The goals governing the
    privilege were insufficient to warrant this court extending the privilege to
    such spouses, who in my view have a greater interest in protecting marital
    harmony and avoiding the repugnance of testifying against one another than
    divorcees: <em>Nero</em>, at para. 185. While I acknowledge that these
    determinations were made in different analytical contexts from that in the
    present case, I find these cases helpful in resolving this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[207]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In conclusion, an examination of the language of s. 4(3) and the
    policy goals underlying spousal privilege demonstrate that spousal privilege
    cannot be claimed by an individual where his or her marriage ended by divorce. </span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Admitting the Communication Does not Perpetuate the Initial Trial’s
    Miscarriage of Justice</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[208]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I also disagree with the appellant’s argument that admitting the
    appellant’s communications with his spouse would perpetuate the miscarriage of
    justice occasioned by the first trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[209]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As I understand the appellant’s position, he argues that: i) at the
    time of his first trial, he was married to his spouse; ii) his subsequent divorce
    was a direct result of his original overturned conviction; iii) a new trial was
    ordered as a result of a miscarriage of justice; iv) and, at the time of this
    new trial, the appellant was no longer married and the communications became
    admissible. Since this admissibility is only possible because there was an
    initial miscarriage of justice and the subsequent ordering of a new trial, to
    admit the evidence would perpetuate the miscarriage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[210]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I do not agree. The reasoning inherent to this argument is strained,
    and in any event the appellant adduced no evidence before the trial judge to
    demonstrate a causal connection between the appellant’s first conviction and
    his subsequent divorce. Given the centrality of such a causal connection to the
    appellant’s reasoning on this issue, I cannot accept the argument. The trial
    judge did not err by refusing to exclude the communications on the basis of
    this unproven assumption.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[211]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In conclusion, the trial judge did not err in her interpretation of
    section 4(3) of the <em>Canada Evidence Act</em>, nor in refusing to exercise
    her discretion to exclude the communications. I would dismiss this ground of

    frank, and fair disclosure in the ITO for the first authorization, and the
    following authorizations were therefore tainted. According to the appellant, if
    the issuing justice had been aware of certain inconsistencies in the evidence
    of Mr. Khaleyi, the initial authorization would never have been issued; and </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the requirement of investigative necessity had
    not been established, as other reasonable alternative methods of investigation
    existed, including searching for the murder weapon and searching a possible
    location of the shooting. As the intercepts were unlawful, the appellant argued
    that his s. 8 <em>Charter</em> rights had been violated and the evidence should
    be excluded under s. 24(2).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[218]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In response, the Crown argued that, while Sergeant Pirt had failed
    to include some details in the ITO, he was not expected to include every
    detail. And, even if the information had been included, it would not have
    resulted in the authorizations being denied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[219]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge ruled that the two conditions precedent to granting
    a wiretap authorization under s. 186(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> were met.
    Our court has referred to these conditions precedent as the “probable cause”
    and “investigative necessity” requirements: <em>Nero</em>, at para. 114.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[220]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>With respect to the probable cause requirement, the trial judge
    found that it was met given the evidence that a crime had been committed and
    that granting the interception would afford evidence of the offence. In
    reaching this conclusion, the trial judge observed that the affiant had not
    been cross examined and therefore had no opportunity to correct errors or
    address questions relating to the credibility of Mr. Khaleyi or Ms. Morales. <a
name="_Hlk60655391"></a></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[221]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While the trial judge acknowledged that the affiant made some
    errors, she concluded there was no basis to excise anything in the ITO or to
    find that he was intentionally or grossly negligent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[222]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also found that the investigative necessity
    requirement was met. She found that, while it was possible that the reasonable
    alternative methods of investigation proposed by the appellant may have yielded
    some useful evidence, “it was unlikely or unrealistic that those searches would
    solve the murder”. The purpose of the wiretaps was to develop a viable
    prosecution of the persons believed to have murdered Mr. Zalal. While other
    techniques would continue, the police were forced to resort to other
    techniques, such as the wiretaps, to develop a “proper foundation for any
    effective prosecution of the murder”. The authorizing justice therefore had a
    sufficient basis to grant the initial authorization. The trial judge concluded
    that there was no breach of the appellant’s s. 8 rights. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Arguments on Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[223]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the authorization should have been set
    aside on two bases.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[224]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, the affiant did not make full, frank, and fair disclosure
    regarding the substance of Mr. Khaleyi’s various police interviews. The
    affiant’s summary of the witness’ statements were inaccurate and minimized the
    inconsistencies in his account. The appellant references <em>R. v. Booth</em>,
    2019 ONCA 970, at para. 56, to argue that the trial judge should have
    recognized the obligation on the affiant to include all information that
    challenges the reliability and credibility of the evidence used to support the
    application. The affiant’s errors were not minor or technical and they deprived
    the authorizing justice of the opportunity to properly address the witness’
    evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[225]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second, the trial judge erred in finding that the ITO satisfied the
    requirement for investigative necessity. Before seeking wiretap authorization,
    the police should have investigated the information provided by Mr. Khaleyi
    regarding the location of the murder and the location of the murder weapon. The
    ITO failed to explain why these leads were not followed up on. If the police
    had been able to locate the murder weapon or the location of the murder, they
    may have been able to find evidence that could have advanced the case. These
    were reasonable alternative options that should have been pursued. The
    appellant further submits that the trial judge erred in finding that he had to
    show that these methods were likely to solve the murder; they only needed to be
    likely to advance the investigation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[226]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argues that, if this court holds that the
    appellant’s statements to the police were not voluntary, the corresponding
    portions of the ITO should be excised and a reassessment should be undertaken. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[227]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Given these errors, the appellant argues that his s. 8 rights were infringed
    and the evidence should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>.
    The affiant’s conduct was not in good faith and the state conduct was serious.
    The impact on the appellant’s privacy interests was extreme. Both factors
    favour exclusion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[228]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The respondent submits that the trial judge did not commit any error
    and that this ground of appeal should be dismissed.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[229]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The legal basis for the issuance of a wiretap authorization is set
    out in Section 186(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. It states the following:</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>that other investigative procedures have been tried and have failed,

  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>The probable cause

    acquire: future communications, not yet in existence, perhaps not even in
    contemplation at the time the authorization is sought or granted. These
    communications may never take place. But if they do, the likelihood of anything
    said affording evidence of a listed offence is enhanced by their probable
    participation in that offence. It is in that sense that interception of what
    they say will afford evidence of the offences. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>It is also important to

  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[236]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, the trial judge made no error in law or fact that that
    would warrant this court’s interference with her findings. She considered the
    relevant record and concluded that the affiant did not breach his obligation to
    make full, fair, and frank disclosure, and that the ITO satisfied investigative
    necessity. I see no errors in these conclusions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[237]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, the trial judge did not err in concluding that the affiant
    met his obligation to make full, fair, and frank disclosure. The trial judge
    specifically noted that the affiant did not fail to supply evidence that was
    germane to a proper assessment of Mr. Khaleyi’s credibility. The ITO set out relevant
    and pertinent information, such as Mr. Khaleyi’s age and criminal background, as
    well as his demands for financial benefits, among others. It also highlighted
    Mr. Khaleyi’s animosity towards the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[238]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While there were some inconsistencies in Mr. Khaleyi’s statements, I
    agree with the trial judge’s assessment of the law that the affiant is not
    required to include every detail. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[239]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Furthermore, the issuing justice did not have to assess whether all
    the information provided by Mr. Khaleyi was true, but only whether the ITO
    established “<em>a reasonably grounded belief</em> in the commission of the
    offence and the collection of evidence about it” (emphasis added): <em>Nero</em>,
    at para. 117.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[240]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I also agree with the trial judge that any errors in the ITO were
    not fatal. The trial judge made specific findings that errors within the
    affidavit were not intentional or the result of gross negligence. This finding
    is entitled to deference. Reviewing justices are not to microscopically review
    the ITO for errors. Instead, they must determine whether the issuing judge
    could have been satisfied that the information in the affidavit made out a
    reasonably grounded belief in the prerequisites for issuance. The trial judge
    did not err in her conclusion on this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[241]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge was also entitled to conclude that the investigative
    necessity requirement had been met. Wiretap authorizations are not a measure of
    last resort. They can also be used when other investigative methods appear to
    have little chance of success. As noted in<em> Nero</em>, the requirement is to
    be interpreted in a practical, common sense fashion with due regard to the
    nature of the investigation and the objectives of the investigators: at para. 110.
    In this case, the trial judge correctly assessed what would be required to
    solve the murder and determined that, while other methods may assist, the
    wiretap was necessary to gather evidence demonstrating who was responsible for
    Mr. Zalal’s murder. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
