  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal considers the role of “public
    correction” in a shareholder’s proposed class action for misrepresentation in
    the secondary securities market, pursuant to s. 138.3 of the <em>Securities Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That same issue was considered by this court in
    a decision released in February of this year<em>: Drywall Acoustic Lathing and Insulation,
    Local 675 Pension Fund v. Barrick Gold Corporation</em>, 2021 ONCA 104 (“<em>Barrick
    OCA</em>”), leave to appeal refused, [2021] S.C.C.A. No. 202, and rev’g 2019
    ONSC 4160, 148 O.R. (3d) 755 (“<em>Barrick SCJ</em>”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge in this case, who followed his
    own decision in <em>Barrick SCJ</em>, did not have the benefit of <em>Barrick
    OCA</em> when he dismissed the appellant’s motion for leave to pursue the
    statutory remedy under s. 138.8 of the <em>Securities Act</em>. After the
    release of that decision, and before argument of this appeal, this court requested
    additional written submissions from the parties on the impact of <em>Barrick
    OCA</em> on this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal and remit the leave motion to the Superior Court for determination.</span></p>

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The facts necessary for the disposition of this
    appeal can be briefly stated.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent Imperial Metals Corporation
    (“Imperial”) is a reporting issuer in Ontario. Its shares trade on the Toronto
    Stock Exchange.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant is an individual shareholder. She
    pleads that she acquired shares of Imperial during the class period (defined as
    August 15, 2011 to August 4, 2014, inclusive) and held some or all of those
    shares at the end of the class period.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 4, 2014, Imperial issued a press
    release, reporting that the tailings storage facility (the “TSF”) at its Mount
    Polley gold and copper mine in British Columbia had been breached, releasing an
    “undetermined amount of water and tailings”. The press release stated that the
    cause of the breach was unknown.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following this disclosure, Imperial’s share
    price declined by 40% and the company lost about $500 million in market
    capitalization.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As a result of the failure of the TSF, millions of cubic metres of liquid
    mining waste were released into the surrounding environment. Government
    authorities and independent commissions investigated and produced reports on the
    circumstances of the TSF breach.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This action pursuant to s. 138.3 of the <em>Securities Act</em> was
    commenced by notice of action filed three days after the failure of the TSF.
    The statement of claim was issued one month later, on September 8, 2014. The
    appellant alleged that the breach of the TSF was caused by deficiencies in its design,
    construction, and operation.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Statutory Cause of Action</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Section 138.3, contained in Part XXIII.1 of the <em>Securities Act</em>,
    creates a cause of action for misrepresentation in the secondary securities
    market. It complements ss. 130 and 131, contained in Part XXIII, which create statutory
    causes of action for misrepresentation in the “primary” market, in a prospectus,
    offering memorandum, or take-over bid circular.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Section 138.3(1) provides:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Where a responsible issuer or a
    person or company with actual, implied or apparent authority to act on behalf
    of a responsible issuer releases a document that contains a misrepresentation,
    a person or company who acquires or disposes of the issuer’s security <span
class=Underline>during the period between the time when the document was
    released and the time when the misrepresentation contained in the document was
    publicly corrected</span> has, without regard to whether the person or company
    relied on the misrepresentation, a right of action for damages against, [the
    responsible issuer, directors, certain officers, influential persons and
    experts.] [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Section 138.8(1) contains a screening mechanism: no action may be
    commenced under s. 138.3 without leave of the court and the court shall only
    grant leave where it is satisfied that (a) the action is being brought in good
    faith; and (b) there is a reasonable possibility that the action will be
    resolved at trial in favour of the plaintiff. In <em>Theratechnologies inc. v.
    121851 Canada inc.</em>, 2015 SCC 18, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 106, Abella J. stated
    that the leave requirement was intended to be more than a “speed bump” and
    requires a reasoned consideration of the evidence to ensure the action has a
    reasonable possibility of success.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>For the purpose of this appeal, it is unnecessary to describe the
    genesis or content of the statutory scheme in any detail. This ground has been thoroughly
    covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Canadian Imperial Bank of
    Commerce v. Green</em>, 2015 SCC 60, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 801, at paras. 63-69 and
    the decision of this court in <em>Rahimi v. SouthGobi Resources Ltd.</em>, 2017
    ONCA 719, 137 O.R. (3d) 241, <em>per</em> Hourigan J.A., at paras 35-49, leave
    to appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 443.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Based on the recommendations of the Allen Committee in 1997,<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Part XXIII.1 was aimed at
    deterring corporate non-disclosure, protecting investors, and incentivizing
    accurate and timely disclosure by public issuers, while avoiding the American
    experience of predatory “strike suits”. It was designed to be implemented
    through class actions, so as to realize the goals of access to justice for
    shareholders and behaviour modification in relation to public issuers of securities.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Unlike the common law action for misrepresentation, which requires
    the plaintiff to prove that they relied on the misrepresentation, the statutory
    remedy does not require the plaintiff to prove reliance. A causal link between
    the misrepresentation and the plaintiff’s damages is presumed, and the
    defendant bears the onus of proving that some or all of the damages are
    “attributable to a change in the market price of securities that is unrelated
    to the misrepresentation or the failure to make timely disclosure”: <em>Securities
    Act</em>, s. 138.5(3). The statute contains caps on corporate and individual
    liability (s. 138.7(1)) and a defence of “reasonable investigation” (s.
    138.4(6)).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There has been some debate in the case law concerning the role of
    “public correction” in the statutory scheme. Section 138.3(1) provides the remedy
    to anyone who “acquires or disposes of the issuer’s security during the period
    between the time when the document [containing the misrepresentation] was
    released and the time when the misrepresentation contained in the document was
    publicly corrected”. The case law diverges on the question of whether public
    correction is an element of the statutory cause of action or simply a time-post
    to identify and delimit the members of the class.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In <em>Barrick OCA</em>, Hoy J.A. did not find it necessary to
    resolve this question, finding that in any event public correction is a
    “necessary part of the statutory scheme”: at para. 41. Later in her reasons,
    she observed that the Allen Committee “appears to have viewed a public
    correction simply as part of the statutory scheme — a necessary time-post for
    the proposed class period and any eventual damages calculation”: <em>Barrick
    OCA</em>, at para. 66. She noted that the Committee appears to have assumed
    that the misrepresentation would be corrected or that the necessary disclosure
    would be made. She concluded that “[i]f the Committee intended to limit the
    proposed statute’s applicability only to those misrepresentations later
    explicitly corrected, it is surprising that it did not so indicate in its
    otherwise extensively canvassed report”: <em>Barrick OCA</em>, at para. 67.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Allegations in the Statement of Claim</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In her second fresh as amended statement of claim, the appellant
    seeks, among other things, leave to commence a statutory action pursuant to s.
    138.3 of the <em>Securities Act</em>, and an order certifying the action as a
    class action under the <em>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</em>, S.O. 1992, c. 6
    and appointing her as the representative plaintiff.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant asserts that Imperial was negligent in the design,
    construction, and operation of the TSF. She claims that Imperial’s disclosure
    documents contained untrue representations, omitted material facts that were
    required to be stated, and omitted material facts that were necessary to make
    other statements not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they
    were made. She alleges that “the truth was revealed” by the breach of the TSF
    and the press release on August 4, 2014, which she pleads were “corrective” of
    the misrepresentations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>On behalf of herself and all other class members, the appellant
    asserted the statutory remedy in s. 138.3(1), the remedy for primary market
    misrepresentation in s. 132.1(1) of the British Columbia <em>Securities Act</em>,
    R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 418 in relation to an offering memorandum, negligence <em>simpliciter</em>,
    and common law negligent misrepresentation.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Relying on his reasons in <em>Barrick SCJ</em>, the motion judge
    dismissed the appellant’s motion for leave under s. 138.8(1) of the <em>Securities
    Act</em>. He found that to obtain leave under the <em>Act</em>, the plaintiff
    must allege not only a misrepresentation but also <span class=Underline>some
    discrete and identifiable public correction</span>. That correction, he said,
    must be reasonably capable of revealing to the market the existence of an
    untrue statement of material fact or an omission to state a material fact. At
    the outset of his reasons, he stated, at para. 1:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In a motion for leave under s. 138.8 of the <em>Securities
    Act</em>, it is not enough to allege a secondary market misrepresentation.
    There must also be some evidence of a public correction. Absent a public
    correction, the statutory action for damages is not available and the motion
    for leave must be dismissed. [Footnote omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Later, the motion judge observed that s. 138.3(1) makes it clear
    that the statutory right of action does not arise unless the plaintiff can
    point to <span class=Underline>both</span> an alleged misrepresentation <span
class=Underline>and</span> a public correction of the misrepresentation.
    Relying on his decision in <em>Barrick SCJ</em>, he stated, at para. 10:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Absent a discrete and identifiable public
    correction (whether provided by the defendant company or a third party) there
    is no basis for a s. 138.3 misrepresentation action – the absence of a public
    correction is “dispositive” and there is no need to proceed further and consider
    whether leave should be granted under s. 138.8. [Footnotes omitted.]</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In the <em>Barrick Gold</em> leave motion, I
    summarized how this court has defined &quot;public correction.&quot; It is
    sufficient for the purposes of this motion to focus on what in my view is the
    key requirement: the public correction must be reasonably capable of revealing
    to the market the existence of an untrue statement of material fact or an
    omission to state a material fact.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In other words, there must be some indication
    in the alleged public correction (when compared to an earlier material
    disclosure) that the earlier material disclosure contained a misstatement or
    was misleadingly incomplete.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If the alleged public correction, on a fair
    reading (and in comparison to an earlier disclosure) does not provide some
    indication that the earlier disclosure was not truthful or was misleadingly

lang=EN-CA>The motion judge did not find it necessary to determine whether
    Imperial’s public statements about the safe design, construction, or operation of
    the mine contained misrepresentations, because Imperial argued – and the motion

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The motion judge found that the press release issued on August 4,
    2014 could not be a public correction because it said nothing more than (1) the
    TSF had been breached; (2) the cause of the breach was unknown; and (3) the
    company was working with the authorities to assess the damage. There was
    nothing in the press release to indicate that the breach of the TSF was caused
    by deficient design, defective construction, or problems in operation. There
    was nothing to correct any misrepresentation or to indicate to an informed
    reader or analyst that what the company had previously said about the subjects
    was untrue or misleading. Nor was there anything in the press release that, on
    a fair reading, could be linked to any of the alleged misrepresentations. “Put
    simply”, the motion judge said, “the news that the TSF has failed for reasons
    that are unknown does not amount to a correction of anything that was stated
    previously”: at para. 28.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The motion judge said that the press release could only have served
    as a correction if the earlier misrepresentation had stated, “The TSF is built
    to be failproof, and will never, ever fail.” Had that been the misrepresentation,
    the press release advising that the TSF had indeed failed would arguably have
    been a public correction of the earlier misstatement.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In <em>Barrick SCJ</em>, as in this case, the motion judge dealt
    with a motion for leave under s. 138.8 of the <em>Securities Act</em>. The
    plaintiffs sought to bring a class action against Barrick Gold on the basis of alleged
    misrepresentations and omissions in its public disclosures concerning a mining
    project in Chile and Argentina. The motion judge denied leave for most of the
    alleged misrepresentations on the basis that they had not been publicly
    corrected.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The motion judge observed that public correction plays an important
    role in the statutory scheme under Part XXIII.1. It not only serves to identify
    the nature and extent of the misrepresentation allegation, but also gives
    notice to the defendant of the case it has to meet, and acts as a “time-post” for
    the proposed class period and the calculation of damages: <em>Barrick SCJ</em>,
    at para. 15.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In the motion judge’s view, expressed at paras. 16 and 19 of <em>Barrick
    SCJ</em>, public correction is also a constituent element of the statutory
    cause of action:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In the absence of a discrete and identifiable
    public correction (whether provided by the defendant company or a third party)
    there is no basis for a s. 138.3 misrepresentation action - the absence of a

    consider whether leave should be granted under s. 138.8.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If the alleged public correction, on a fair
    reading, does not arguably reveal to the market the existence of the alleged
    misrepresentation - that is, the existence of the allegedly untrue assertion or
    the alleged omission in the impugned representation - then there is no public
    correction and no basis for the proposed s. 138.3 action. [Footnotes omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As he did in this case, the motion judge said that the leave
    application could be determined by assuming misrepresentations had been made
    and focusing on whether the public correction requirement had been satisfied.
    He dismissed most of the claims on the basis that there was nothing in the
    alleged corrections that provided a link to the alleged misrepresentations or
    omissions or that was capable of revealing their existence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This court, speaking through Hoy J.A., allowed an appeal from the
    motion judge’s order: <em>Barrick OCA</em>. It directed that the issue of leave
    with respect to certain alleged misrepresentations should be remitted to a
    judge of the Superior Court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As mentioned, Hoy J.A. did not find it necessary to determine
    whether “public correction” is an element of the statutory cause of action, but
    she observed that it is a “necessary part of the statutory scheme”: <em>Barrick
    OCA</em>, at para. 41. She said that the approach taken by the motion judge –
    assuming the alleged misrepresentations are made out and denying leave on the
    basis that there is no reasonable possibility that a trial court would find that
    there was a public correction – “is an approach that should be used rarely” and
    with “great caution”: <em>Barrick OCA</em>, at para. 46. She added, at para.
    48, that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Judicial economy likely only outweighs the
    interests of an issuer and its shareholders in a finding as to whether there is
    a reasonable possibility that the trial court would find a misrepresentation
    and the risks entailed in assuming a misrepresentation when: the motion judge
    is faced with an overwhelming record; and the motion judge is confident that
    there is no material overlap between the evidence relevant to whether there is
    a misrepresentation, and the evidence of the context in which the alleged
    public correction was made and how the alleged public correction would be
    understood in the secondary market.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Hoy J.A. also found that the motion judge erred in engaging in a
    purely textual reading of the proposed public correction: <em>Barrick OCA</em>,
    at paras. 53-54. A proper analysis would also require an examination of the
    context in which the alleged public correction was made and how the alleged public
    correction would have been understood in the secondary market if it does not,
    on its face, reveal the existence of the alleged misrepresentation: <em>Barrick
    OCA</em>, at para. 48.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Moreover, Hoy J.A. found that assuming the falsity of the
    misrepresentation may not be appropriate where the misrepresentation is not
    facially obvious. That may require the judge to consider evidence relevant to
    whether there is a reasonable possibility that a trial court will find a
    misrepresentation: <em>Barrick OCA</em>, at para. 48.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Hoy J.A. explained that the same reasoned consideration of the
    evidence is necessary when the alleged misrepresentations are
    misrepresentations by omission. She disagreed with the motion judge’s statement
    that the alleged public correction, on a fair reading, must arguably reveal to
    the market the alleged omission of the material fact. She stated, at para. 76:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The public correction need not specifically
    identify the omitted material fact or specifically relate the information in
    the correction to the omitted material fact. As stated earlier, if the alleged
    public correction does not, on its face, reveal the existence of the alleged
    misrepresentation, the motion judge must engage in a reasoned consideration of
    evidence concerning the context in which the alleged public corrections were
    made and how the alleged public corrections would be understood in the
    secondary market. The critical question for the motion judge is whether the
    alleged public correction was reasonably capable of being understood in the
    secondary market as correcting what was misleading in the impugned statement.

    of the correction, without regard to the evidentiary context of the
    misrepresentation and of the public correction. He construed public correction

lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that there is at least a reasonable

    namely, the risk that the TSF might fail. The statutory right of action should
    be read in a manner that will incentivize both the avoidance of
    misrepresentations, and their prompt and thorough public correction where

    submits that the issue of whether public correction is an element of the
    statutory cause of action was not disputed before the motion judge and should
    not be addressed in this court. The respondent submits that the motion judge’s

lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my respectful view, the motion judge set the bar too high by
    requiring that the public correction be express and directly linked to a
    specific misrepresentation, which, he said, would have to have been something
    like: “The TSF is built to be failproof, and will never, ever fail.” To paraphrase
    the observation of Hoy J.A. in <em>Barrick OCA</em>, there need not be facial
    symmetry between the public correction and the alleged misrepresentation or
    omission: at para. 76.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I adopt the observations of Hoy J.A. in <em>Barrick OCA</em> with
    respect to the role of public correction in the statutory cause of action.
    Unlike the common law action for misrepresentation, which is theoretically
    available in this case and in other claims for misrepresentation in the
    securities context, the plaintiff and class members asserting statutory claims
    for secondary market misrepresentation are not required to plead or establish
    causation – that is, that they relied on the misrepresentation in acquiring the
    securities. The statute effectively deems reliance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Absent the need to prove causation, misrepresentation does the heavy
    lifting in the statutory cause of action. It is the wrong at issue and it forms
    part of the context in which the public correction operates and would be
    understood by the market. In most cases, the trial judge (or the judge on the
    s. 138.8 leave motion) will be required to consider the misrepresentation(s) or
    omission(s), the alleged public correction, and the context of both to
    determine whether the misrepresentation was corrected. It will remain open to
    the defendant to establish that the drop in the share price was caused by
    general market conditions, or by a specific development in the issuer’s
    business or the industry that was not a consequence of the inadequate
    disclosure: see Committee on Corporate Disclosure, <em>Toward Improved
    Disclosure: A Search for Balance in Corporate Disclosure</em>, interim report (Toronto:
    Toronto Stock Exchange, 1995), at para. 6.43.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While public correction is a necessary part of the statutory scheme,
    its role, at least at the leave stage, is a modest one. Hoy J.A. clearly considered
    this to be the case when she observed in <em>Barrick OCA</em>, at para. 71,
    that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Where there is a reasonable possibility of a
    misrepresentation, the plaintiff’s claim can hardly be characterized as a
    strike suit. Furthermore, the clearing of the misrepresentation threshold,
    combined with the fact that the plaintiff brought an action, suggests that
    there was a public correction. The plaintiff must have learned of the misrepresentation
    somewhere. [Footnote omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The role of public correction was not set out by the Allen Committee
    and, as Hoy J.A. observed, the committee appears to have assumed that the
    misrepresentation would be corrected or the necessary disclosure would be made: <em>Barrick OCA</em>, at para. 67.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In many cases, perhaps most, the public correction will clearly
    reveal the existence of the alleged misrepresentation and the Allen Committee
    may have assumed that would be the case. Indeed, most of the secondary market
    misrepresentation cases that have come before the courts in Canada have
    involved express public corrections. But that does not necessitate an express
    correction or preclude the plaintiff from asking the court to infer a
    correction based on something other than an express statement by the company,
    coupled with the market’s response.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As the motion judge himself noted in <em>Swisscanto</em>, the public
    correction need not be a “mirror-image” of the alleged misrepresentation or a
    “direct admission that a previous statement is untrue”: at para. 62, citing <em>Ironworkers
    Ontario Pension Fund (Trustee of) v. Manulife Financial Corp.</em>, 2013 ONSC
    4083, at paras. 64-71. There need only be “<em>some linkage or connection</em> between the pleaded public correction and the alleged misrepresentation”: <em>Swisscanto</em></span>,<em> </em><span lang=EN-CA>at para. 65; <em>SNC-Lavalin</em>, at para. 147; <em>Cappelli</em>,
    at para. 143; <em>Kauf</em>, at para. 124. That linkage or connection will
    assist the judge in determining how the alleged corrective disclosure would be
    understood in the secondary market.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Moreover, as the motion judge also observed in <em>Swisscanto</em>, the
    public correction need not be issued by the company itself and can emanate from
    third parties: at para. 62; see also <em>Mask v. Silvercorp Metals Inc.</em>,
    2015 ONSC 5348, at para. 29.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The modest role of public correction in the statutory cause of
    action is consistent with s. 138.5(3) of the <em>Securities Act</em>, mentioned
    earlier, which places the onus on defendants to prove that some or all of the
    plaintiffs’ damages are attributable to a change in the market price of
    securities that is unrelated to the misrepresentation. This would leave it open
    to the defendants to prove that the alleged public correction is not a
    correction at all, because the change in market price was due to other factors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Focusing on the market’s understanding of the alleged correction is
    also consistent with one of the core purposes of the statutory framework – to
    incentivize fair and accurate disclosure by public issuers. Permitting an
    issuer to escape liability by making vague or general disclosures (“something
    has happened and we are looking into it”) is inconsistent with that core
    purpose. It would undermine confidence in the securities market and deprive
    shareholders of compensation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I conclude that, in light of <em>Barrick OCA</em>, the motion judge
    erred by imposing an unduly onerous standard for establishing public
    correction. This was an error of law and is reviewable on a correctness
    standard: see <em>Mask v. Silvercorp Metals Inc.</em>, 2016 ONCA 641, 132 O.R.
    (3d) 161, at paras. 36-37.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Furthermore, this was not one of those rare cases alluded to by Hoy
    J.A. in <em>Barrick OCA</em>, in which the motion judge could fairly and safely
    dispose of the requirement to determine whether the issuer released a document
    that contains a misrepresentation and conclude that there is no reasonable
    possibility that the action will be resolved at trial in favour of the
    plaintiff.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>As the motion judge observed, the record was voluminous, and the
    allegations of misrepresentations and omissions were hotly contested. The
    motion judge decided, however, that he did not have to deal with the
    misrepresentation issues because he found, based on a purely facial reading of
    the press release, that there was no public correction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>Without an examination of the evidence concerning the alleged misrepresentations
    or omissions – what they were, when they occurred, and the context in which
    they were made – it would be impossible for the motion judge to determine
    whether the alleged public correction was reasonably capable of being
    understood in the market as correcting what was misleading in the impugned
    statement. Depending on what had been said, or not said, in Imperial’s public
    disclosures over the years concerning its waste management practices and
    environmental compliance measures, and the context in which the representations
    and the alleged public correction were made, a motion judge could find that the
    press release could be understood by the market as corrective and that there
    was a reasonable possibility that the action would be resolved in favour of the
    plaintiff at trial.</span></p>
