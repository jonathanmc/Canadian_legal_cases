    S. Rasaiah of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, with reasons
    on sentence reported at 2018 ONSC 6747.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Thorburn J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><u><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nicholas Berto appeals from his conviction for dangerous
    driving causing bodily harm and failure to remain at the scene of an accident.
    He also seeks leave to appeal from the 18-month sentence imposed on him on the first
    count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, and the 6-month sentence on the
    second count of failure to remain at the scene of the accident, to be served
    consecutively. In support of this second ground of appeal he seeks leave to
    admit fresh evidence consisting of a report by a forensic psychiatrist, Dr.
    Rootenberg.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no dispute at trial that, after
    driving into a crowd of people assembled in a parking lot, the appellant stopped
    briefly and then turned his vehicle and exited the parking lot, hitting Mr. </span><span
lang=EN-CA>VanderGriendt</span><span lang=EN-CA> and seriously injuring him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant took the position at trial that, in
    addition to the charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, the lesser
    included offence of dangerous driving <em>simpliciter</em> should have been
    left with the jury. He claimed that while he initially drove toward the crowd
    in anger, he then stopped his vehicle. He said that after stopping his vehicle,
    the crowd yelled and kicked at his tires, prompting him to leave because he was
    afraid of the crowd.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He therefore took the position that his initial
    drive toward the crowd should be considered a separate incident from his decision
    to leave the parking lot. The appellant also requested that the defence of
    self-defence be left with the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge held that the driving was one
    transaction and there was no independent cause or reasonably unforeseen event
    such that the transaction should be viewed as two acts. She therefore declined to
    leave the lesser included offence of dangerous driving with the jury (although
    she did allow the appellant’s request to leave the defence of self-defence with
    the jury).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claims the trial judge erred in
    law by not leaving the lesser included offence of dangerous driving for the
    jury to consider. He therefore seeks a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also seeks leave to admit fresh
    evidence from a forensic psychiatrist and seeks leave to appeal both sentences.
    He submits that the fresh evidence renders both sentences unfit and asks that
    both sentences be varied to suspended sentences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the alternative, the appellant claims that the
    trial judge erred by failing to consider evidence of a psychologist as a
    mitigating factor on the sentence for the failure to remain. He argues that the
    six-month consecutive sentence for failure to remain at the scene of the
    accident should be set aside and replaced with a six&#8209;month sentence to be
    served in the community, or that the six-month sentence be concurrent to the
    18-month sentence for dangerous driving causing bodily harm, thereby reducing
    his global sentence to 18 months.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    conviction appeal, dismiss the fresh evidence application, allow leave to
    appeal the sentence but dismiss the sentence appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><u><span lang=EN-CA>THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT TRIAL REGARDING
    THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE</span></u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 11, 2016, the appellant had recently
    turned 18 years of age. He decided to go out with some friends. He drove his
    pickup truck and went to two bars. He returned to the first bar at around
    midnight, having had two beers over the course of the evening.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Approximately 20 members of the aviation
    community were also at the bar to celebrate the retirement of a friend. The
    appellant played pool with two of them: Mr. VanderGriendt and Mr. Gillanders. The
    appellant flirted with Ms. Traynor, another member of the aviation group.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Just before 2 a.m. the appellant went outside with
    Mr. Gillanders and told him that he might like to take Ms. Traynor on a date
    sometime. Mr. Gillanders responded that she would never date him because he was
    a “little punk”. The appellant and Mr. Gillanders began to fight and the
    appellant pushed Mr.&nbsp;Gillanders up against the window of the bar.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Traynor testified that when she saw that
    their conversation was becoming heated, she went outside and stepped between
    them. There were approximately 15 to 20 people outside the bar. Several
    witnesses testified that the appellant was really upset and other members of
    the group pulled the appellant off of Mr. Gillanders. A physical fight erupted
    between the appellant and members of the group.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant then walked back to his truck. After
    reaching the truck, the appellant turned back toward the crowd, gesturing angrily
    with a broken beer bottle. The appellant testified that someone had thrown the bottle
    from behind him, and that he picked it up in order to intimidate the crowd. Others
    testified that the appellant took the bottle from the truck and smashed it on
    the ground before advancing on the crowd.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant got into his truck and turned the
    engine on. He agreed that the crowd was not near his truck when he got in. This
    was confirmed by a surveillance camera. As such, he could have left unimpeded.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Instead, he rolled down his window to continue
    yelling at the crowd to get out of his way. According to the appellant, he was
    upset and mad. He decided that although there were several exits out of the
    parking lot, “that’s the exit I wanted to take and that’s the way I was going
    to go so, I was telling them to get out of the way.” He chose the exit that
    brought him into the crowd.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant reversed his truck out of the
    parking spot, turned and accelerated toward the crowd. He agreed that he was
    not driving slowly and a witness described his driving as “aggressive”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant then stopped his truck. The police
    pedestrian motor vehicle collision reconstruction expert watched the video of
    the events and calculated that the stop lasted between three and five seconds.
    The appellant and other witnesses to the event agreed the stop was brief.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified that the crowd was “not
    happy with me” and that members of the crowd were yelling vulgarities and his
    vehicle was being kicked. No one but the appellant testified that his truck was
    being kicked.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant said that at this point, his
    natural instinct was to leave, and he made an “aggressive motion just to get
    out of there”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He quickly accelerated the truck. Although he
    looked to his left where most members of the crowd were, he did not look to his
    right before turning. One witness testified that as the driver hit the gas, he
    appeared to almost lose control of the truck and “turned really sharply,
    erratically”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified that he was worried
    about being punched or pulled out of his truck. As he accelerated out of the
    lot, he felt a bump, and figured he had hit something or someone. The appellant
    did not slow down or stop. Instead he accelerated out of the lot at a high rate
    of speed. The other witnesses agreed that the appellant drove quickly and the
    police collision reconstruction expert opined that the appellant’s truck did
    not brake as it left the parking lot.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After leaving the parking lot, the appellant testified
    that he felt shaken up. He hid his vehicle overnight before turning himself in
    to police the next day.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. VanderGriendt was 25 years old. He and Mr. Dolman
    were both standing in front of the truck. Mr. Dolman who was on the left-hand
    side of the truck, was able to get out of the way, but Mr. VanderGriendt who
    was on the right-hand side of the truck, was not. He was run over by the truck.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. VanderGriendt was rendered tetraplegic and
    remains dependent for all activities of daily living.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the pre-charge conference, the appellant's
    trial counsel argued that the included offence of dangerous driving </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>simpliciter </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>should be left with the
    jury as an available verdict because:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There's one transaction here, but there's two
    - within the one transaction there is two separate driving incidents [<em>sic</em>],
    and the intervening act is the stoppage of the vehicle and the conduct which
    occurs between the accused and the crowd at that time.... [E]ven under s. 249
    [of the <em>Criminal Code</em>], in the circumstances the argument from the
    defence is, well, that could have been dangerous driving at that point in time,
    but when the driving occurred that caused the death, that was a result of fear,
    and you have to put yourself in those circumstances in which he was in.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[I]t's the defence position is that you have
    to leave with the jury the underlying offence, so that I can say to the jury, “Well,
    you know, if you accept - if you have a reasonable doubt about what he says was
    going and what he felt like - what was going on in his mind at the time he made
    the right turn that resulted in causing the bodily harm, you can find him not
    guilty of that, but you may find him guilty of, you know, the actual rolling
    down the window and driving that vehicle in and coming to a stop. That could be
    dangerous driving there.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel submitted that the jury could find

    counsel filed a psychological assessment of the appellant by Dr. M. Keith Lefave.
    Dr. Lefave concluded that the appellant “is currently functioning in the very
    low range of cognitive ability” and suffers from social anxiety disorder. Dr.
    Lefave found that for individuals with social anxiety disorder,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Social situations almost always provoke fear
    or anxiety and they are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The
    fear is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation
    and may give rise to instinctual and frantic fight and/or flight reactions.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge “was not persuaded on a
    balance of probabilities to give Mr. Berto’s cognitive assessment weight in
    terms of contextualizing what was going on in his head in respect of his moral
    blameworthiness at the time of the offence”. Instead, she attributed his decision
    to drive toward the crowd to “his anger and upset with the crowd”. While she
    referred to the report in imposing her sentence for dangerous driving causing
    bodily harm, she did not specifically refer to the report in imposing her
    sentence for the failure to remain charge.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claims the psychological report
    provided support for the appellant's position that he left the scene because he
    was scared and worried. The appellant claims his reaction was a plausible
    manifestation of his social anxiety disorder.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant concedes that the trial judge was
    entitled to reject the psychological evidence as mitigating but claims her
    failure to consider it altogether in relation to the failure to remain count, constitutes
    an error in law. He submits that this failure to consider a mitigating factor
    materially affected the sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He claims that, taking into account the fact that
    he ultimately turned himself in, a six-month sentence served in the community
    is appropriate. Alternatively, given the unique circumstances, a concurrent
    sentence is adequate to address the principles of denunciation and deterrence
    while recognizing the appellant's youth.</span></p>

    diminished intelligence may be important in identifying moral fault and degree
    of responsibility”. However, she also noted that the appellant knew he had hit
    someone or something, he did not report the accident, he knew someone was hurt
    after he spoke to his friend following the incident, and he continued to drive
    his truck to his parents’ property and hid it overnight because he was scared
    and wanted to think things through.</span></p>
