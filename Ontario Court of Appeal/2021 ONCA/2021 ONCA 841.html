  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Benotto J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:200%'>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November 2018, Premier Doug Ford (“Ford”) announced that an OPP
    Commissioner had been appointed. Interim Commissioner Brad Blair (“Blair”) was
    not chosen. The new Commissioner was a friend of the Ford family. Blair wrote a
    scathing letter on official police letterhead to the provincial Ombudsman alleging
    improprieties in the selection process and requesting an independent review. The
    letter was made public.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When reporters questioned Ford about the letter, Ford suggested that
    Blair had breached the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Police Services Act</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;font-style:normal'> R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15 (“</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>PSA</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%;font-style:normal'>”)</span></em>. Blair sued Ford for defamation.
    Ford brought a motion under the provision of s.137.1 of the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Courts of Justice Act</span></em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43. Section
    137.1 was designed to address lawsuits against individuals who speak out about
    an issue of public interest. This type of motion is often referred to as an anti-SLAPP
    motion. SLAPP is the acronym for <span lang=EN-CA>Strategic Lawsuit Against
    Public Participation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The action against Ford was dismissed. Blair now appeals. Ford
    cross-appeals the motion judge’s determination with respect to costs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal in part.</p>

lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The background facts are not in dispute.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 5, 2018, the then OPP Commissioner
    announced his retirement effective November 2, 2018. The appellant Brad Blair
    became the Interim Commissioner. A job competition for the permanent position was
    publicly posted, seeking applications from police officers at a rank of Deputy
    Police Chief or higher or Assistant Commissioner or higher in a major police
    service. Within days, the job requirements were amended to remove the minimum
    rank requirement. On November 29, 2018, the province announced who the new OPP
    Commissioner would be. The new appointee was known to be a friend of Premier
    Ford. The appointee would not have qualified for the job but for the amendment
    to the qualifications.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On December 11, 2018, Blair sent a nine-page
    letter to the provincial Ombudsman and released a copy to the public. The
    letter was sent on OPP letterhead and alleged several improprieties in the
    appointment process of the OPP Commissioner as well as general misfeasance by
    Ford. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Ministry of the Attorney General (MAG)
    briefed Ford. The Briefing Note concluded that aspects of Blair’s letter could
    arguably constitute breaches of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>PSA</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:
200%;font-style:normal'> </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:

font-style:normal'>which prohibits police officers from communicating to the
    media without proper authority and from disclosing confidential information. </span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>The Briefing Note was subject to several qualifications and
    unknowns, including whether Blair acted in good faith and whether he had proper
    authority to write the letter. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ford received the Briefing Note and was made
    aware of the conclusion some time before December 18, 2018. Within a few days, a
    retired police officer (unrelated to this action) also filed a complaint with
    the Ontario Independent Police Review Director. The officer accused Blair of
    breaching the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>PSA</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> on substantially the same grounds as those listed in the MAG
    Briefing Note.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On three occasions, reporters questioned Ford
    about the letter from Blair. Ford said the following:</span></p>

    motions on November 23 and 30, 2020. He heard the s. 137.1 motion on December 4,
    2020 and dismissed the action. The motion judge deviated from the presumptive
    award of full indemnity costs and awarded Ford partial indemnity costs based on
    the motion judge’s own calculations. He also ordered that half of the costs be
    paid immediately with the other half payable when Blair’s separate action was
    settled or disposed of. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN>Section 137.1 was meant to address SLAPP
    lawsuits. These lawsuits are described as follows in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>1704604 Ontario Ltd. v. <a name="_Hlk87867605">Pointes Protection </a>Association</span></em><span
lang=EN>, 2020 SCC 22, 449 D.L.R. (4th) 1, at para. 2:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>SLAPPs are generally
    initiated by plaintiffs who engage the court process and use litigation not as
    a direct tool to vindicate a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>bona fide</span></em><span
lang=EN> claim, but as an indirect tool to limit the expression of others. In a
    SLAPP, the claim is merely a façade for the plaintiff, who is in fact
    manipulating the judicial system in order to limit the effectiveness of the
    opposing party’s speech and deter that party, or other potential interested
    parties, from participating in public affairs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 137.1 allows a defendant to move at an
    early stage to dismiss such a lawsuit. A motion under s. 137.1 to dismiss such
    a lawsuit involves a shifting burden and a framework that was set out in <em>Pointes
    Protection</em></span><span lang=EN>, at para. 18:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In brief, s. 137.1
    places an initial burden on the moving party – the defendant in a lawsuit – to
    satisfy the judge that the proceeding arises from an expression relating to a
    matter of public interest. Once that showing is made, the burden shifts to the
    responding party – the plaintiff – to satisfy the motion judge that there are
    grounds to believe the proceeding has substantial merit and the moving party </span><span
class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>has no valid defence</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>, and that the </span><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>public
    interest in permitting the proceeding to continue outweighs the public interest
    in protecting the expression</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>. If the responding
    party cannot satisfy the motion judge that it has met its burden, then the s. 137.1
    motion will be granted, and the underlying proceeding will be consequently
    dismissed. It is important to recognize that the final weighing exercise under
    s. 137.1(4)(b) is the fundamental crux of the analysis … legislative debates
    emphasized balancing and proportionality between the public interest in
    allowing meritorious lawsuits to proceed and the public interest in protecting
    expression on matters of public interest. Section 137.1(4)(b) is intended to
    optimize that balance. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Often a SLAPP is used to protect speech and combat
    a power imbalance sometimes present in defamation cases, where the plaintiff has
    significant resources and the defendant is vulnerable.</span></p>

    strictly speaking, a SLAPP suit” because Blair was not a large and powerful
    organization using litigation to intimidate and silence a vulnerable opponent.
    He determined that, nonetheless, because Ford’s expressions relate to public
    interest, s. 137.1 was engaged. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the motion judge’s
    overall approach to s. 137.1 was flawed because, though the motion judge found
    that the appellant’s claim did not have the indicia of a SLAPP, he did not use
    this finding in his analysis of s.&nbsp;137.1. In my view, the appellant is implicitly
    submitting that s. 137.1 did not apply at all. But he further says that even if
    it did apply, the fact that it did not possess all the indicia of a SLAPP
    should have been considered in the analysis by the motion judge. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fact that the usual indicia of a SLAPP were
    not present does not mean that s. 137.1 does not apply. In this regard the
    appellant is importing a requirement that does not exist in the statute or in the
    jurisprudence. The Supreme Court has clarified that s. 137.1 should be broadly
    construed to apply to proceedings that arise from expression. As the motion
    judge articulated, the legislature specifically avoided reference to the term “SLAPP”
    in the provision. In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Pointes
    Protection</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;font-style:

lang=EN-CA>at para. 24 the Supreme Court specified the following:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>What is crucial is
    that many different types of proceedings can arise from an expression, and the
    legislative background of s. 137.1 indicates that a broad and liberal
    interpretation is warranted at the s. 137.1(3) stage of the framework. This
    means that proceedings arising from an expression are not limited to those<em> directly</em> concerned with expression, such as defamation suits. A good example of a type
    of proceeding that is not a defamation suit, but that nonetheless arises from
    an expression and falls within the ambit of s. 137.1(3), is the underlying
    proceeding here, which is a breach of contract claim premised on an expression
    made by the defendant … <span class=Underline>Indeed, the [Anti-SLAPP Advisory
    Panel: Report to the Attorney General] explicitly discouraged the use of the
    term “SLAPP” in the final legislation in order to avoid narrowly confining the
    s. 137.1 procedure … and the legislature obliged</span>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor do I accept the appellant’s submission that
    the indicia of a SLAPP should have been specifically addressed at each step in
    the judge’s analysis. This too has been clarified in <em>Pointes<a
name="_Hlk87268902"> Protection</a></em>, at paras. 78-79:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I note that in<a name="_Hlk87268757"><em> Platnick
    v. Bent</em>, 2018 ONCA 687, 426 D.L.R. (4th) 60</a>, at para. 99, Doherty J.A.
    made reference to recognized “indicia of a SLAPP suit” (emphasis omitted). He
    recognized four indicia in particular: (1) “a history of the plaintiff using
    litigation or the threat of litigation to silence critics”; (2) “a financial or
    power imbalance that strongly favours the plaintiff”; (3) “a punitive or
    retributory purpose animating the plaintiff’s bringing of the claim”; and (4)
    “minimal or nominal damages suffered by the plaintiff” (para.99). Doherty J.A.
    found that where these indicia are present, the weighing exercise favours
    granting the s. 137.1 motion and dismissing the underlying proceeding…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I am of the view
    that these four indicia may bear on the analysis<em> only to the extent</em> that
    they are tethered to the text of the statute and the considerations explicitly
    contemplated by the legislature. This is because the s.&nbsp;137.1(4)(b) stage
    is fundamentally a public interest weighing exercise and not simply an inquiry
    into the hallmarks of a SLAPP. Therefore, for this reason, the only factors
    that might be relevant in guiding that weighing exercise are those tethered to
    the text of s.&nbsp;137.1(4)(b), which calls for a consideration of: the harm
    suffered or potentially suffered by the plaintiff, the corresponding public
    interest in allowing the underlying proceeding to continue, and the public
    interest in protecting the underlying expression. [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Importantly, the

    the equation in favour of a theoretical assessment by a “reasonable trier” …
    The clear wording of s. 137.1(4) requires “the judge” hearing the motion to
    determine if there exist “grounds to believe”. Making the application of the
    standard depend on a “reasonable trier” improperly excludes the express

    judge ignored his affidavit evidence outlining the emotional harm and the
    damage to his reputation. The motion judge found only bald assertions of
    emotional or psychological harm, and found no evidence of any resulting
    financial or economic harm. There is no evidence that the plaintiff was
    disciplined by the OPP for “breaching the<em> PSA</em>”, that he was suspended
    from his duties because of these allegations, or that he lost any pay. The
    claim of a lost job opportunity because of the defendant’s<em> PSA</em> allegations

    statement of claim has now been issued. Although the motion judge referred to
    it as a wrongful dismissal action, the issued claim includes damages for
    misfeasance in public office, negligence, negligent misrepresentation,
    intentional infliction of mental suffering, <em>Charter</em> breaches, and
    damages of approximately $15 million including special, punitive, and exemplary

    that the public interest in permitting the action to continue is outweighed by
    the public interest in protecting that expression – is a discretionary finding

    unnecessary “deep dive” into the evidence that greatly increased costs.
    Applying the considerations of r. 57.01 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>,

    was added by the motion judge in the last substantive paragraph of his reasons.
