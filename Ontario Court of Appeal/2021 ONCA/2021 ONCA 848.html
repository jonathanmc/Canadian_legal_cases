<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>I.        Introduction </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was charged with sexual
interference and sexual assault. The three complainants, who are sisters, are
the nieces of the appellant. They alleged that the appellant committed the
sexual offences between 1993 and 2000, when they were each between the ages of
four and nine. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found the appellant guilty of
one count of sexual assault and one count of sexual interference. The sexual
assault charge was stayed pursuant to the <em>Kienapple</em> principle: <em>Kienapple
v. R.</em>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to
nine months’ imprisonment.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her reasons for judgment, the trial judge
focused on the issue of “collusion”. She found that there had been “far more
discussion of the details of the allegations” between two of the nieces than
either was prepared to admit in their testimony. These discussions gave rise to
a “real concern that the similarities of their accounts are the product of
collusion, whether conscious or unconscious.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><sup><sup><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a>
The trial judge was thus unable to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the
appellant sexually assaulted or interfered with either of these two nieces. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Rejecting the appellant’s evidence as
“unreliable and suspect”, the trial judge ultimately convicted the appellant of
the offences committed against the third niece. The third niece shared her
memories of the appellant’s sexual offences via a text to one of her sisters,
before either of her two sisters told her about their experiences with the
appellant. Therefore, the trial judge found that the third niece’s memory was
not tainted. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals his conviction. He does
not take issue with any aspect of the trial or with the trial judge’s reasons
for judgment. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s sole ground of appeal is based
upon proposed fresh evidence in the form of two affidavits, submitted by his
sister, who is the aunt of the three complainants. The appellant argues that
the fresh evidence directly contradicts the credibility of the third niece.
Accordingly, he seeks a new trial. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the following reasons, we are not persuaded
by the appellant’s arguments and refuse to admit the fresh evidence.
Consequently, we dismiss the appeal. </span></p>

<p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>II.       Proposed Fresh Evidence</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s sister swore two affidavits: one
dated October 22, 2019 and the second dated November 21, 2020. In her first
affidavit, the appellant’s sister claimed that the third niece had told her
that she discussed the appellant’s sexual offences with her two sisters much
earlier than the third niece indicated at trial. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The facts surrounding the alleged admission of
collusion are as follows. The appellant’s sister stated that on May 18, 2017,
the day before the appellant was charged, she was working at the family
business and observed a meeting between the three nieces and their father.
After the meeting, the three nieces and their father left the premises and
seemed upset. The appellant’s sister said she called the third niece later that
evening to ask if she was all right. The third niece shared that there were
“serious allegations about a member of the family” and the appellant’s sister
guessed that the member of the family was the appellant. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s sister swore that she spoke with
the third niece again on May 19, 2017. According to the appellant’s sister, the
third niece told her that two to three weeks earlier, the three complainants
had spent the evening together drinking wine and had discussed the appellant’s
sexual offences. Finally, the appellant’s sister said that she did not offer
this evidence earlier because she was not aware that collusion between the
three sisters was a relevant issue until she read the trial judge’s reasons for
decision. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her second affidavit, dated some thirteen
months after the first, the appellant’s sister submitted additional evidence,
claiming that “we kind of rushed the [first] affidavit” and that the purpose of
the second affidavit was to “fill in the blanks”. According to the appellant’s
sister, the third niece told her on May 19, 2017 that “she couldn’t remember
anything” about the appellant’s sexual offences. The appellant’s sister then
asked the third niece “why, if she couldn’t remember anything, she wanted to
put [the appellant] in jail”.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that his sister’s fresh
evidence directly calls into question the third niece’s credibility on a key
issue of evidence – that is, the existence of collusion between the third niece
and her two sisters. In essence, the appellant submits that the conversation
that the three nieces allegedly had over wine, two to three weeks before police
charged him, tainted the third niece’s memory.  </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court has broad discretion to receive fresh
evidence on appeal where “it considers it in the interests of justice”: <em>Criminal
Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s.&nbsp;683(1). The Supreme Court of Canada
established the test that governs the admission of fresh evidence in <em>Palmer
v. The Queen</em>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p.&nbsp;775. This court has since
reformulated the <em>Palmer</em> test: <em>R. v. Truscott</em>, 2007 ONCA 575,
225 C.C.C. (3d) 321, at para. 92. The inquiry consists of three questions: </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>What is the explanation offered for the failure

admissibility of the evidence? (due diligence criterion)</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits the fresh evidence to
demonstrate that the third niece, a Crown witness, made a prior inconsistent
statement. The respondent concedes that the proposed fresh evidence meets the
admissibility criterion.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The cogency criterion consists of three prongs: <em>Truscott</em>,
at para. 99. In considering cogency, this court asks the following questions:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Is the evidence relevant in that it bears upon a
decisive or potentially decisive issue at trial? </span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Is the evidence credible in that it is
reasonably capable of belief? </span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Is the evidence sufficiently probative that it
could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be
expected to have affected the result? </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the respondent acknowledges, the adduced
evidence is relevant because it bears on the decisive issue of the third
niece’s credibility. The trial judge’s finding that the third niece was
credible was central to the ultimate conviction of the appellant. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, the proposed fresh evidence is not
credible for the following reasons. First, the appellant’s sister was less than
forthright in her affidavits. During her cross-examination, she declared that
she was able to submit her second affidavit over a year after the first
affidavit because she had a “very good memory”. Yet she failed, in either
affidavit, to mention a text message that she had sent to the three
complainants on May 19, 2017, when the three nieces were at the police station.
In that text, the appellant’s sister pleaded with the nieces to not “go to the
police,” since “putting [the appellant] in jail is not going to change anything
and when my mom finds out and if he goes to jail, she will die”. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, the appellant’s sister refused to
admit the extent of her knowledge of the allegations against the appellant. In
cross-examination, she denied that she knew anything about the nature of the
complainants’ allegations against the appellant. Yet in her May 19, 2017 text
message to the complainants, she seemed to appreciate that the appellant had
committed a wrong and might go to jail and suggested that the involved family
members seek help from a psychiatrist. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, despite her professed neutrality, we
find that the appellant sister’s evidence was tainted by her evident desire to
keep her brother out of jail. During cross-examination, she declared that she
still did not believe that the appellant ought to go to jail. She also agreed,
when questioned, that she disbelieved the complainants and believed the
appellant “without knowing any information”. Clearly, the appellant’s sister
was an interested and partial affiant.  For these reasons, we conclude that the
appellant has not met his onus to establish that the fresh evidence is
credible.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally on the credibility point, it should be
noted that in addition to her testimony on collusion, the appellant’s sister
testified in her second affidavit that the third niece stated that she had no
memory of the appellant’s sexual offences. It is difficult to believe that the
appellant’s sister would not have appreciated the significance of this admission
when it was provided to her. The appellant’s sister has offered no credible
explanation as to why she did not immediately bring the third niece’s alleged
admission to the attention of defence counsel or her brother.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, we are also not persuaded that the
fresh evidence is sufficiently probative. The key piece of evidence upon which
the trial judge relied was the text conversation between the third niece and
one of her sisters. In that conversation, the third niece described how the
appellant would sit her on his lap and engage in “dry humping”. The trial judge
reasonably concluded that the text conversation was the first occasion on which
the third niece described her experiences to her sister and that her evidence
was untainted by collusion. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In contrast, the appellant sister’s claims
beggar belief. If her central claim – that the three nieces colluded by
discussing the appellant’s sexual offences at a conversation over wine – is
taken as true, then the only logical conclusion is that the three complainants
anticipated that collusion would become an issue at trial. The third niece
would have had to fabricate a narrative in her text conversation with her
sister in the hopes that the trial court would see her evidence as reliable and
untainted. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Such conclusions are implausible, and we see no
basis to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that the third niece was a
credible and reliable witness. Her text conversation with her sister was a
critical piece of evidence, and nothing in the appellant sister’s affidavits
successfully contradicts that evidence. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In conclusion, we refuse to admit the proposed
fresh evidence and consequently dismiss the appeal.</span></p>

class=FootnoteTextEmphasisChar>R. v. C.G</span><i>.</i>, 2021 ONCA 809, at
paras. 28-32, Nordheimer J.A. </span>explained the analytical difference
between “conscious” or “advertent collusion”, on the one hand, and
“unconscious” or “inadvertent collusion”, on the other. Specifically,
“advertent collusion” is a form of conspiracy between witnesses that undermines
their credibility. In contrast, inadvertent collusion caused by innocent
exposure to another’s version of events undermines the reliability of a
witness’s evidence by confusing their memory. He recommended that since the
word “collusion” connotes conspiracy, it is preferable to refer to “inadvertent
tainting”. </p>
