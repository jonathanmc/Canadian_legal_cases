lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After a trial by judge and jury, the appellant
    was convicted of assault causing bodily harm. The appellant appeals from his
    conviction. He has abandoned the appeal against his sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Brief Summary of Facts</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and the complainant were in a
    long-term relationship. Around 12:30 p.m. on January 30, 2017, the complainant
    called 911 to report that the appellant had choked her. The police responded to
    the call and arrested the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant went to the hospital and photos
    were taken of her injuries. The complainant disclosed to the nurse that the appellant
    had choked her. The nurse examined the complainant and observed that she had
    numerous bruises and abrasions on her face and body. The nurse did not detect
    any signs of impairment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After leaving the hospital, the complainant
    attended a police station and provided a videotaped statement. In that
    statement, the complainant told the police that she had an argument with the
    appellant over money. After the complainant swore at the appellant, the
    appellant grabbed her from behind, choked her and then sexually assaulted her. In
    that statement, she told the police that she had called 911 and that she went
    to her daughter’s residence. She told the police that she had told her daughter
    about being choked. However, the complainant told the police that she had not
    disclosed the sexual assault to either her daughter or the nurse at the
    hospital.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Complainant Recants</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the preliminary hearing and the trial, the
    complainant recanted all of the allegations. At trial, the complainant
    testified that she had spent the weekend consuming drugs and that she had a
    poor recollection of the events. She testified that on the morning of the
    incident, the appellant came to her house while she was still under the
    influence of the drugs. She yelled at the appellant, tried to punch him, and
    then lost consciousness. When she awoke, she was sitting on the floor against
    the couch and the appellant was tending to her. She and the appellant then had
    consensual sex. The complainant testified that she did not recall calling 911
    or going to her daughter’s residence, the hospital, or to the police station.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge made several rulings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s previous conviction for
    assaulting this complainant – a guilty plea to assault causing bodily harm in
    2012 – was admitted for the purpose of helping the jury understand the nature
    of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant and to support
    the inference of animus.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The 911 call was admitted not for the truth of
    its contents but only to help the jury assess the complainant’s credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the complainant’s police statement was
    admitted for the truth of its contents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant advances three grounds of appeal:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge erred in not instructing the
    jury on prior consistent statements;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge erred in admitting prior
    disreputable conduct evidence; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge erred in admitting the
    complainant’s statement to the police.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>No “Prior Consistent Statement” Instruction</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge should
    have given a limiting instruction on the use of prior consistent statements
    because there was a real danger that the jury would have looked to the
    complainant’s prior statements <span class=Underline>before</span> she spoke to
    the police as confirmatory of her statement <span class=Underline>to</span> the
    police because they were all consistent. A “prior consistent statement”
    instruction is given to warn jurors that consistency between statements made by
    a complainant, on its own, provides no insight into the credibility of the
    complainant because repetition does not make a statement more likely to be true.
    The appellant acknowledges that his trial counsel did not ask for this limiting
    instruction, but nevertheless argues that it was required in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, the trial judge did not err by
    failing to give such an instruction. There was no real risk in this case that
    the jury would err in its reasoning, namely, by finding the complainant was
    telling the truth in the police statement about being choked because it was
    consistent with what she had told people earlier.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the Crown did not argue at trial that the
    consistency of the complainant was a factor to consider in assessing the
    complainant’s credibility. The consistency of the complainant’s statements was
    not a live issue at trial, and it was not necessary for the trial judge to
    comment or provide an instruction that would highlight the consistency of the
    complainant’s statements. This case is not similar to the cases cited by
    counsel for the appellant where the consistency of the complainant’s account was
    at risk of being used to bolster the complainant’s credibility or corroborate
    the complainant’s trial testimony: see e.g., <em>R. v. Warren</em>, 2016 ONCA
    104, 26 C.R. (7th) 390; <em>R. v. Dinardo</em>, 2008 SCC 24, [2008] 1 S.C.R.

    mid-trial and final instructions to the jurors on prior inconsistent statements.
    The trial judge explained that the jury could only use prior inconsistent
    statements to assess credibility and could not use the complainant’s earlier
    statements, such as the 911 call, as evidence of what actually happened unless
    they were satisfied that the complainant accepted the earlier version as true. Of
    course, the complainant had recanted her prior statements and did not adopt them
    during trial. The jury would have understood that the prior statements
    (specifically, the 911 call and the police statement) were diametrically
    opposed to the complainant’s trial testimony and that only the inconsistency
    could be used to assess her credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, in another area of her charge, the trial
    judge specifically instructed the jury that it should only rely on the police
    statement if the contents of the statement were confirmed by evidence <span
class=Underline>not connected</span> to the complainant. The jurors would have
    understood that they needed to seek out independent evidence of confirmation of
    the police statement before they could act on it. Logically, prior statements
    made by the complainant were not independent sources of confirmation and would
    not have been improperly used by the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The adequacy of a trial judge’s instructions
    must be assessed in the context of the particular case on a functional basis. There
    was no realistic risk that the jury would have looked for confirmatory evidence
    in any consistencies between the earlier statements to find that the
    complainant must have been telling the truth in the police statement. The fact
    that defence counsel did not ask for the specific instruction, now sought on
    this appeal, demonstrates that the trial counsel was not concerned about the
    risk that is now complained of by counsel for the appellant.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Admitting Prior Disreputable Conduct</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    by admitting evidence of the appellant’s prior assault of the same complainant.
    We do not accept this submission.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The details of the prior assault were admitted
    for the purposes of understanding the nature of the relationship between the appellant
    and the complainant and to determine whether the appellant had animus toward
    the complainant. The trial judge held that the two incidents were similar in
    that they showed the appellant’s disposition to assault the complainant when
    she disrespected him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge noted that, “for the jury not to
    know about the prior assault would present an artificially sanitized and
    antiseptic picture of the nature of the relationship” between the two. The
    trial judge also found that there was little danger of moral prejudice if an
    appropriate caution was given. In our view, the prior conviction is probative
    of the nature of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant and
    was properly admitted, especially in light of the trial judge’s caution to the
    jury that they must not use the prior conduct to conclude that the appellant is
    a person of general bad character who was more likely to commit the alleged
    assault.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge ruled that the complainant’s
    police statement was admissible pursuant to the principled exception to the
    hearsay rule enunciated in <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Khelawon</em>, 2006 SCC 57,
    [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787. Given the complainant’s recantations, the necessity
    component of the exception was made out and conceded. The trial judge ruled
    that the statement was procedurally reliable because (a) the complainant knew
    the statement was being recorded; (b) she gave the statement under a solemn
    affirmation to tell the truth; (c) her statement appears to be voluntary; and
    (d) the complainant was a witness at trial and available for cross-examination,
    and it was not fatal to the admissibility of the statement that the complainant
    later claimed a lack of memory. The trial judge found that the probative value
    of the statement was “extremely high” because it was a statement from the
    alleged victim made very soon after the alleged events. The trial judge found
    that its probative value highly outweighed its prejudicial effect and admitted
    the statement for the truth of its contents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that because the
    complainant claimed to have no memory of the majority of the weekend, calling
    911, going to the hospital, or making the statement to police, defence counsel
    could not cross-examine the complainant effectively at trial and the trial
    judge erred in finding the contrary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, the trial judge grappled with this
    issue and found the opportunity to cross-examine the complainant was not
    illusory. She found that, while the complainant claimed no memory of making the
    statement, the complainant did have a memory of the events of the morning in
    question. She also found that the appellant’s trial counsel had shown that he
    could effectively cross-examine the complainant on a prior <em>voir dire</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The admissibility of hearsay evidence is a
    question of law. The factual findings that go into that determination are
    entitled to deference. A trial judge is well placed to assess the hearsay
    dangers in a particular case and the effectiveness of any safeguards to assist
    in overcoming them: see <em>R. v. Chretien</em>, 2014 ONCA 403, 309 C.C.C. (3d)
    418, at paras. 43-55. We would defer to the trial judge’s decision in the
    absence of any error.</span></p>
