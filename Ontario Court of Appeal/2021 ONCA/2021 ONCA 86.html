lang=EN-CA>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentence,
    and if leave is granted, appeals his sentence imposed for his convictions for armed
    robbery and wearing a disguise with intent to commit an indictable offence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant pleaded guilty. He was sentenced
    to six months’ imprisonment for the robbery count, three months’ imprisonment for
    the wearing a disguise with intent count, to be served concurrently, and 12
    months’ probation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The offences were committed when the appellant
    was 21 years old. At the time of sentencing, the appellant was 24 years old and
    a first-time offender without any prior criminal record. His sentence appeal is
    based on two main grounds. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant submits that the sentencing
    judge failed to properly apply the principles relevant when sentencing Indigenous
    offenders, set out in <em>R. v. Gladue</em>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, as the judge
    permitted denunciation and general deterrence to improperly overwhelm the
    analysis. The appellant claims that this error led to the arbitrary conclusion
    that no jail sentence less than six months was appropriate in the
    circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant submits that there has
    been a new development in the law since the appellant’s sentencing, allowing this
    court to impose a conditional sentence on the robbery count. Due to <em>R. v.
    Sharma</em>, 2020 ONCA 478, 152 O.R. (3d) 209, leave to appeal granted, [2020]
    S.C.C.A. No. 311, a recent decision from this court striking down s. 742.1(c)
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, conditional sentences are now available for
    offences where the maximum penalty is 14 years or life imprisonment, including
    robbery. The appellant effectively argues that this development entitles him to
    a conditional sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the following reasons, I would not interfere
    with the sentence imposed. However, I would allow the appeal for the limited
    purpose of permanently staying the execution of the appellant’s remaining
    period of incarceration. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>FACTS</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 5, 2016, at approximately 11:24 a.m., the
    appellant entered a branch of the Bank of Montreal in Ottawa. His face and head
    were covered by a shirt. He walked over to a teller, produced an eight-inch
    knife, and, while brandishing the weapon at the teller, demanded money. The
    appellant made these threats in the presence of other patrons, including a
    mother and her two young children. He managed to flee the scene with $5,000. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The robbery went unsolved for quite some time. On
    August 11, 2016, the police distributed a media release to try to identify the
    perpetrator of the robbery. However, it was not until January 2018, almost a
    year and a half after the robbery, that the appellant was arrested. At that
    time, the ex-girlfriend of the appellant’s brother identified the appellant,
    leading to his arrest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In October 2018, the appellant pleaded guilty to
    the offences of robbery and wearing a disguise, two weeks before his three-day
    trial on November 13, 2018. A <em>Gladue</em> report and a pre-sentence report
    were prepared for the sentencing hearing, which took place in August 2019. The imposition
    of the sentence was adjourned to September 2019. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the sentencing hearing, the appellant,
    through his lawyer, filed various materials documenting his positive attributes
    and post-plea rehabilitative steps. In addition, both the pre-sentence report
    and the <em>Gladue</em> report were presented to and relied on by the
    sentencing judge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown sought a global sentence of one-year
    incarceration, followed by probation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence requested a sentence which the
    sentencing judge described as “nuanced”. They sought either a non-custodial or intermittent
    sentence on the robbery charge, and a conditional sentence followed by
    probation for the offence of wearing a disguise. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence pointed to the significant progress
    that the appellant had made since the offence; his work history; and the fact
    that at the time of the offence, he was affected by a drug addiction that he received
    treatment for by the time of sentencing. The appellant also had a close and
    supportive relationship with his mother. In addition, he was remorseful, had
    made full restitution, and was willing to participate in a sentencing circle, although
    the victims were not interested. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of six
    months’ incarceration for the robbery count and three months’ concurrent for
    the wearing a disguise count, followed by 12 months’ probation. He gave a very
    thorough decision in which he fully considered the applicable principles of
    sentencing. He recognized that as the appellant was an Indigenous offender, he
    had to be sentenced with reference to the<em> Gladue</em> principles and s.
    718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The sentencing judge also observed that
    a fit and appropriate sentence must be guided by the fundamental principle that
    a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree
    of responsibility of the offender. He then specifically addressed the
    mitigating and aggravating factors and crafted a sentence which was responsive to
    the circumstances of the appellant. In arriving at what the sentencing judge
    deemed a fit sentence for the appellant on the robbery offence, he made the
    following observations:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There is no minimum sentence for robbery, so
    in - at least, in theory, I could consider a suspended sentence and a period of
    probation. Although a blended sentence of probation on the robbery and a
    conditional sentence on wearing disguise is theo - theoretically available, in
    my view, it would be an error in law to impose a conditional sentence on a
    lesser-related offence, and one cannot do this simply to avoid parliament’s
    intention. A pure suspended sentence on - on both counts is - is theoretically
    available, but in my view, suspending sentence on both counts and just placing
    the accused on probation <span class=Underline>would not address the
    seriousness of the offences, or the principles of sentences</span>; and, in
    fact, defence counsel has essentially conceded this by suggesting a blended
    sentence - includes a - a conditional sentence.</span></p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It’s indicated there is no minimum sentence
    for robbery. However, I find that it would be an error in law to impose a
    suspended sentence and a period of probation, <span class=Underline>given that
    this was a bank robbery, and it involved a weapon. Thus, the sentence must
    involve custody in - in some fashion</span>. Parliament has directed that it
    cannot be conditional, with respect to the robbery offence. <span
class=Underline>I might add that, if a conditional sentence was available for
    the robbery, I would seriously consider it;</span> in my view, specific
    deterrence is not a factor in this case, and there are many mitigating
    circumstances. And, deterrence, in some cases, can be met by a conditional sentence.
    However, Parliament has directed that a conditional sentence is not available
    for a robbery. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    two motions for fresh evidence, dated June 17, 2020 and August 18, 2020. These
    motions seek to adduce evidence relevant to the appellant’s post-sentence rehabilitative
    efforts and steps taken to live a pro-social life. Both motions included the
    consent of the respondent to the admission of this fresh evidence. As a
    preliminary conclusion, I am satisfied that this evidence satisfies the
    criteria for the admission of such evidence set out in <em>Palmer v. The Queen</em>,

    and general deterrence to overwhelm the analysis?</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant does not argue that the sentence
    was unfit. Instead, he submits that the sentencing judge erred in principle in his
    application of the <em>Gladue</em> principles, by overemphasizing the
    principles of denunciation and general deterrence. He argues that this error enables
    this court to alter the sentence on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He contends that, had the sentencing judge
    properly applied the <em>Gladue</em> principles, he would have more heavily
    considered restorative justice principles and imposed a lower sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I disagree. The sentencing judge correctly
    weighed the relevant sentencing principles. He made proper reference to both the
    circumstances of the appellant and the <em>Gladue</em> principles as codified
    in s. 718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For this court to intervene in the sentence
    imposed, the appellant must establish that the sentence imposed is either
    demonstrably unfit, or that the judge made an error in law or principle that impacted
    the sentence. The seminal case of <em>R. v. Lacasse</em>, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3
    S.C.R. 1089, at paras. 10-11, 39-41, 44, 48-51, and 53, sets out the grounds upon
    which an appellate court may intervene and vary a sentence. Trial judges are
    afforded a wide discretion to impose what they deem to be an appropriate
    sentence. Sentencing is a fact-specific exercise, and each case must be
    considered contextually. This necessarily means that considerable deference is
    afforded to the sentencing judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    and the particular circumstances of the appellant. This was a reasonable
    finding in the circumstances. The offence of robbery is one of the most serious
    offences within the <em>Criminal Code</em>. This offence mandates sentences up

    was being sentenced. He recognized and accepted mitigating factors which inured
    to the appellant’s benefit. He concluded that specific deterrence was not a concern,
    given that the appellant’s post-offence and post-sentence conduct was positive

    analysis which led the sentencing judge to consider a sentence in the low

    general deterrence and denunciation, and proportionality of the gravity of the
    offence, even accepting the reduced moral responsibility of this offender; when
    one takes a look at the offence involved here, which is a bank robbery with a
    weapon</span>; in my view, a custodial period that would be required for
    robbery exceeds that available under an intermittent sentence, which is
    restricted to a term of 90 days. <span class=Underline>However, I must go on to
    consider what is the minimum sentence I can impose - the least restrictive
    sentence I can impose, that satisfies all the sentencing principles and factors
    I’ve outlined, considering importantly, his plea of guilty, the Gladue factors,
    the fact that he is a first offender, the positive pre-sentence report, the
    restitution his counsel is in possession of, and undertaken to pay, and very
    importantly, that there is no need for specific deterrence in this case</span>.
    I’ve concluded, after considerable thought, over a number of weeks not without
    some difficult moments, that the appropriate sentence and the shortest sentence
    that I can impose in this particular case, <span class=Underline>in compliance
    with my duty and responsibility to impose the least restrictive sentence, but

    2015 ONCA 462, 336 O.A.C. 95, at para. 62. Instead, those objectives can be met,
    without disrupting the appellant’s rehabilitative progress, by affirming the
    sentence initially imposed. Furthermore, the sentencing judge explicitly noted
    that specific deterrence was not relevant to the appellant, who in their view
    was not likely to reoffend. My view on the issue of reincarceration is
    strengthened when I consider the Supreme Court of Canada's guidance in <em>Gladue</em>.
    “The community is best protected if the [appellant] continues along [his]
    rehabilitative path”, and I would accordingly stay the remainder of his
    custodial sentence and substitute a total period of probation of two years: <em>R.
    v. Smickle</em>, 2014 ONCA 49, 317 O.A.C. 196, at paras. 18-20; <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Dufour</em>,
    2015 ONCA 426, 326 C.C.C. (3d) 52, at paras. 11, 13, 17, and 29; <em>Owen</em>,
    at para. 63.</span></p>
