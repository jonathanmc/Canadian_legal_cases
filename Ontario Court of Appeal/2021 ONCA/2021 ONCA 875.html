lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals his conviction for sexual
    assault under s. 271 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46.
    There were two issues in the judge-alone trial: whether the complainant
    consented to the act of fellatio – the trial judge found she did not; and
    whether the alleged act of intercourse, which the appellant denied, had
    actually occurred – the trial judge found it had.</span></p>

    for the analysis of the issues and the submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, a 36-year-old general contractor
    and occasional drug dealer, sold the complainant small quantities of cocaine
    from time to time. The complainant was an 18-year-old university student. The
    appellant was charged with sexually assaulting her in the early hours of September
    23, 2016.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to both the appellant and complainant,
    the appellant had texted the complainant on the previous evening and asked
    whether she wanted to meet for a drink. She replied affirmatively and asked him
    to bring some of his “product”. Prior to that occasion, they had met a few
    times, solely for brief drug transactions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant picked her up at her house and
    they drove to a local bar where they had a beer and a “shot”. After about 20 or
    30 minutes, they left the bar and the appellant drove to the parking lot of a
    school near the complainant’s house. She did a “line” of cocaine in the car.
    They got out of the car and smoked and chatted for a while. At this point,
    their stories diverged dramatically.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the complainant, after they got
    back into the car, the appellant grabbed her face and chin and began to kiss
    her aggressively. She tried to pull away and told him to stop. He told her not
    to worry, that they were just having fun. She continued to tell him to stop and
    tried to pull away. He started to undo his pants and she again asked him to
    stop. He placed his hand on the back of her head and pulled her down towards
    his penis and told her to suck it, or words to that effect. She resisted, but
    ultimately did what he asked. During the act, the appellant repeatedly said, “I
    don’t know what you’re doing but it feels good.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At some point, she said, the appellant put his
    hand into her pants and touched her vagina. She said “no, I don’t want to” and
    that she was on her period. He replied that it would feel “amazing”. She
    continued to protest, and he told her he would be gentle. He reclined the
    passenger seat, put the full weight of his body on top of her and forced his
    penis into her vagina. She attempted to close her legs, but he continued. He
    stopped, without ejaculating, after several minutes. He smoked a cigarette
    while she put on her pants and he told her that he would take her home.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the appellant’s evidence, the fellatio was
    consensual and there was no intercourse. After they got back into the car, they
    talked for a while and then began to “make out”. They stopped and discussed
    “where this was going and what [they] were expecting.” They agreed that they
    were not looking for a relationship and would just see what happened. They
    continued to kiss and fondle one another. She rubbed his penis and he fondled
    her breasts. He took his penis out and she began to stroke it while he rubbed
    her vagina outside her jeans. She told him that she was on her period and did
    not usually “give it up” on the first date. He said that she should not worry,
    he was not trying to have sex with her and was not trying to force anything on
    her. The fondling resumed and he asked her to kiss his penis. She began to
    fellate him, while he began to grab her breasts “harder and firmer”. After
    about 10 minutes, the complainant indicated she did not want to continue and
    stopped. He expressed his disappointment and pulled up his pants while she sat
    back in her seat. There was an awkward silence, and the complainant said that
    the second or third date would be a little different, but for now she did not
    want to go further. He lit a cigarette and said “okay, let’s just call it a
    night.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both parties agreed that the appellant then
    drove her home and kissed her when she got out of his car.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant said that when she got home, she
    threw up in the bathroom. She did not awaken her parents because she was
    ashamed and did not want them to know about her drug use. She called a friend,
    K.M., who she knew worked night shifts, and told him she had been “raped by [her]
    drug dealer”. He offered to leave work and come to see her, but she told him
    she would call someone else. She called another friend, S.F., who she knew from
    university and he came to see her. They went to the school near her house and
    talked until early morning, consuming some cocaine and alcohol. After returning
    home, the complainant went to her room, removed her clothing, put it in the
    laundry bin, showered, slept briefly, and went to work at her morning lifeguard
    shift.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>S.F. and K.M. confirmed the complainant’s
    disclosure of the sexual assault to them.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The following day, the appellant sent the
    complainant a text message. It stated: “Hey, how’s it going? I hope I wasn’t
    too rough with you last night. I apologize, but it’s just you’re too cutie.”
    The complainant did not reply. There was no further communication from the
    appellant, and he threw away his cell phone after he found out the police were
    investigating him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the appellant had put his penis in her mouth. She responded “no”. She also
    failed to mention it in her second police interview the next day. It was not
    until the preliminary hearing that she testified that the appellant had forced
    her to engage in fellatio. When asked at trial why she had not disclosed it
    earlier, she identified several reasons: she was ashamed about it and did not
    want to think about it; her memory was “foggy”; and she thought she could have
    prevented it because she could have kept her mouth closed, but she was “just

    the appellant. It was only at trial that she admitted she had used cocaine in

    assessed in light of the presumption of the correct application of the law,
    particularly regarding the relationship between reliability and credibility.
    What matters is not whether the judge used the words “credibility” and

    inferred that she was not sexually assaulted because she did not wash when she
    got home, did not change out of the clothes she had been wearing and, instead,
    returned to the place of the assault and “partied” with S.F. The inference counsel
    wishes us to make, it seems, is that a sexual assault victim would immediately

    afraid of the potential criminal consequences of her own cocaine use.</span></p>

    The alleged errors in the trial judge’s reasoning include: a failure to address
    the reliability of the complainant’s evidence; rejecting the appellant’s
    explanations as implausible and illogical; and using stereotypes, common sense

    specifically stated that he was “conscious of the potential pitfalls of

    avoided it. As to the latter, the trial judge also identified the complainant’s
    explanation that she did not initially disclose her purchase and use of cocaine
    because she was ashamed about it, did not want her parents to find out about it
    and was afraid about the criminal law consequences. The trial judge addressed
    this issue at length in his reasons, noting that the complainant had lied at
    the preliminary hearing. He accepted the complainant’s evidence about why she
    did not disclose her drug use. While the trial judge was obviously aware of the
    significance of lying under oath, and might have found that the falsehoods
    impacted her credibility and reliability, he did not do so. Instead, he found that
    these falsehoods were explained persuasively by the complainant and therefore did
    not impact the complainant’s credibility or reliability on the central issues.

    the evidence to suggest any reason why the complainant would have falsely
    alleged sexual assault. He considered the evidence of her disclosure of the

    complainant had two motives to fabricate: first, because she was concerned that
    the appellant would tell her friend, S.N. (who was not called as a witness),
    and she did not want “word to get around” that she had engaged in sexual
    activity with the appellant; and second, because she was afraid that her

    cross-examination and has no evidentiary foundation. The second is inconsistent
    with the evidence of the complainant, which the trial judge accepted. Moreover,
    it is illogical that the complainant would fabricate a complaint that her drug
    dealer sexually assaulted her if she did not want her parents to know about her
    drug use. The evidence of her gradual, reluctant disclosure – first to her
    friends, then to her mother, then to her father and finally to the police – is
    consistent with judicial experience. It is inconsistent with the motive

    of the <em>Code</em>, which places important limits on the defence of honest
    but mistaken belief in consent by providing that the accused’s belief that the
    complainant consented to the activity is not a defence where the accused did
    not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to him at the time, to
    ascertain that the complainant was consenting. The appellant gave no evidence
    that addressed this issue. Nor were questions put to the complainant on the
    issue.</span></p>

    support an air of reality to honest but mistaken belief in consent. In the face
    of the conflicting accounts of the appellant and the complainant, this is not a
    case where the trial judge could “cobble together” some of the complainant’s
    evidence and some of the accused’s evidence to provide a sufficient basis for
    the defence: see <em>R. v. Park</em>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at para. 25. Trial
    counsel did not suggest this could be done and we heard no submissions from
    counsel for the appellant to suggest how it might be done. We see no basis for
    it and would dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>

    reasons, the trial judge accurately set out the applicable principles,
    including the presumption of innocence, the concept of reasonable doubt and the
    burden of proof. He accurately set out the “test” in <em>W.D</em>. In applying
    those principles, he stated that: (a) he did not believe the appellant’s
    evidence; (b) the appellant’s evidence did not leave him with a reasonable
    doubt; and (c) on all the evidence which he did accept, the Crown had proven
    the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

    displayed bias towards him by quoting directly from his evidence and by placing
    quotation marks around the crude descriptions of the sexual activity that the
    appellant provided in his testimony. He also complains that the trial judge
    demonstrated bias when he said that “the defendant’s evolving explanation for
    sending [the text message the next day] lurched from one implausible
    explanation to another.” Counsel for the appellant suggested that the use of
    the word “lurched” may have been a disparaging comment on the appellant’s stature
    or physique.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not accept these submissions. Quoting
    directly from the language of the witness is sometimes the best way of
    describing their evidence and the meaning conveyed by their words, instead of
    substituting less vulgar language. The trial judge’s use of the appellant’s own
    language, in this case, does not demonstrate bias.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We see no basis at all to the submission that
    the use of the word “lurched” demonstrates bias or some personal insult to the
    appellant. The trial judge used this expression, after quoting directly from
    the appellant’s evidence in chief and in cross-examination, to describe the
    appellant’s “evolving explanation” for saying “I hope I wasn’t too rough with
    you last night” in his text to the complainant the following day. In his
    evidence in chief, the appellant said he sent the text because he felt badly
    for having “used her a little bit”: “Like, she gave me a blow job and then I
    just kind of brushed her off and I sent her home. So I messaged her and I told
    her, ‘I’m sorry, I hope I wasn’t too rough with you.’”</span></p>

    why he felt badly for “using” the complainant when he had testified in chief
    that he and the complainant had discussed what they were expecting out of the
    encounter, agreed that they were not looking for a relationship and decided to
    see what happened. The appellant acknowledged that had been the discussion and
    that they were going to have some fun and see where it went. The following
    questioning ensued:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. So in the morning you felt bad because she
    essentially gave you a blow job, you didn’t do anything, and you didn’t want to
    see her again? That’s why you felt bad?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. Well, that and grabbing her breasts really
    firmly and hard. I kind of felt a little bit bad about that.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. But why? You were having fun, she was
    giggling. Why would you feel bad?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. Maybe I was rough with her, I don’t know.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>As the cross-examination continued,
    the appellant acknowledged that the complainant never objected that he was
    touching her too hard, she never complained about it afterwards and everything
    seemed fine. His evidence shifted from sending the text because he was sorry
    that he had “used” her, to being concerned that he had squeezed her breasts too
    hard.</span></p>

    movement, a stagger, or a stumble. That was an apt description of the
    appellant’s attempts to explain his text message. After making this
    observation, the trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I find that the text was sent because the
    defendant was aware of what he had done and was feeling out [the complainant]
    to gauge his jeopardy. In my view, the fact that he sent the message and the
    way in which it is worded is evidence that tends to confirm [the complainant’s]
    account and also undermines the defendant’s evidence denying that he sexually
    assaulted the complainant.</span></p>
