  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the convictions entered on August 8, 2018
    and the sentence imposed on November 23, 2018 by Justice Kenneth L. Campbell of
    the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p><strong>B.W. Miller J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>Overview</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant had been prescribed marijuana for medical purposes and was
    licenced to possess marijuana under the <em>Access to Cannabis for Medical
    Purposes Regulations</em>,<em> </em>SOR/2016-230 (the “<em>Regulations</em>”).
    When he was arrested for possession of marijuana, he produced a card issued by
    his licenced supplier. The arresting officer was ignorant of the <em>Regulations</em> and believed the card to be a fake. Search incident to arrest produced a
    handgun with oversized magazine and a quantity of cocaine. The appellant
    applied for a declaration that his rights under ss.&nbsp;8 and 9 of the <em>Charter</em> had been violated, and that the gun and drugs be excluded from evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given below, I would set aside the rulings on s. 8 and
    s. 9, but uphold the ruling to admit the evidence under s. 24(2). Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the early morning of August 9, 2017, two police officers on routine
    patrol observed the appellant squaring up to four or five young men in a
    parking lot, and a tow truck parked in a live lane of traffic in an adjoining
    gas station. Concerned that a fight was about to break out, they pulled into
    the parking lot, causing the group of young men to disperse, and the appellant
    to return to his car. On speaking to the tow truck driver, they learned that
    the appellant had been driving recklessly, and had nearly “T-boned” the tow
    truck while turning into the gas station. The tow truck driver urged the
    officers to “go get him.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective Constable Kwang-Jae Lee approached the appellant’s vehicle to speak
    with the appellant. He could smell fresh marijuana coming from either the appellant
    himself or from the inside of the car. He also observed other indicia of marijuana
    possession and use, including grinders and loose marijuana flakes, inside the
    car. Det. Cst. Lee formed the opinion that the appellant was unlawfully in
    possession of marijuana and arrested the appellant for marijuana possession. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon learning of his arrest, the appellant said that he had a licence
    for medical marijuana. The appellant then produced a plastic card issued by
    MedReleaf bearing the appellant’s name, date of birth, and MedReleaf patient
    identification number. It also stated the name of the appellant’s physician and
    the prescription expiry date. The card indicated the appellant was authorized
    to consume 3 g of marijuana per day. The card also stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This card, when presented in conjunction with a valid piece of
    government issued photo identification serves to verify that the named
    individual is a registered patient of MedReleaf Corp.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>The front of the card displayed the MedReleaf logo with
    a phone number and website address.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Det. Cst. Lee did not believe that the card authorized the appellant to
    possess marijuana. His reasons for not believing the appellant were: (1) the
    card looked old, faded, and dirty; (2) the card looked similar to others he had
    seen that falsely asserted that the bearer was legally entitled to possess
    marijuana – cards issued by illegal dispensaries in Toronto and from suppliers
    outside of Canada; (3) the circumstances looked consistent with someone using
    marijuana recreationally rather than medicinally – multiple grinders in view,
    the spread of flakes of marijuana on the centre console of the car, and
    Blackwood cigars sticking out of the appellant’s pants; and (4) the appellant
    did not produce the type of documentation the officer expected – a government
    issued licence bearing the appellant’s photo, a prescription from a physician
    or product packaging referencing a prescription. He testified that he had come
    across many kinds of licenses in his police career, including licenses
    authorizing individuals to possess items that would otherwise have been
    illegal, such as firearms licenses. In his opinion, the card produced by the
    appellant did not resemble those cards. Det. Cst. Lee did not take any further steps
    to determine whether and under what conditions the appellant was authorized to
    possess marijuana. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the date of the incident, marijuana possession remained illegal in
    Canada, subject to an exemption for medical use as provided by the <em>Regulations</em>.
    The regulatory framework had been revised multiple times since the medical
    exemption was first established. The most recent regulations had been enacted
    within the 12 months prior to the incident. Det. Cst. Lee testified at trial
    that he knew marijuana could be legally possessed for medical use, but stated
    that he had not read the <em>Regulations</em> or been briefed on them.
    Consequently, he was unaware of the provisions of the regulatory scheme. He
    testified that he had not received any training on how to identify fake cards
    purporting to authorize marijuana possession.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On arrest, the appellant was subjected to a pat down search, and the
    officers located a plastic bag containing marijuana and a marijuana grinder in
    his pockets. There was no evidence on the <em>voir dire</em> as to whether this
    marijuana was obtained from MedReleaf. The appellant was handcuffed and
    detained in the police cruiser. The search of the vehicle did not produce any marijuana
    product packaging or copy of a physician’s prescription for marijuana use.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Det. Cst. Lee’s partner then searched the appellant’s car incidental to
    arrest. He discovered an after-market compartment in the car containing a
    loaded semi-automatic handgun with an overcapacity magazine. The appellant was
    again placed under arrest for unlawful possession of a handgun, oversized
    magazine, and ammunition. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was taken to the police station and strip-searched. A plastic bag containing
    packages of crack and powder cocaine was found between the appellant’s buttocks.
    The appellant was charged with possession of the cocaine for the purpose of
    trafficking.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a pre-trial application to exclude the gun, ammunition, magazine, marijuana,
    and cocaine from evidence, the appellant argued that the officer had lacked
    reasonable and probable grounds for arresting the appellant after being
    presented with the MedReleaf card, which rendered the arrest unlawful under s.
    9 and the searches incident to arrest unreasonable, contrary to s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown conceded that: (1) the appellant was legally entitled to possess
    marijuana for medical purposes; (2) the card the appellant produced was issued
    to him by MedReleaf, which had a licence to distribute marijuana for medical
    purposes in Canada; and (3) the card’s factual statements were all correct. The
    appellant was authorized to possess marijuana sourced from MedReleaf.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that Det. Cst. Lee’s subjective belief that the appellant
    possessed marijuana unlawfully did not become objectively unreasonable after the
    appellant produced the MedReleaf card. He found that the officer had considered
    the exculpatory explanation – the appellant’s assertion that he was authorized to
    possess marijuana, and the production of the MedReleaf card in support – and
    reasonably rejected it on the basis that he believed the card to be fake. The
    trial judge found that having disbelieved the appellant’s exculpatory explanation,
    Det. Cst. Lee was not required to take any further steps to find evidence that
    might support the appellant’s claim. He found, further, that Det. Cst. Lee would
    have been entitled to search the car and the accused’s person even if he had
    believed the appellant’s card to be genuine, because the card would not have
    excluded the possibility that the appellant possessed more marijuana than he
    was legally authorized to possess.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held in the alternative that even if the arrest had been unlawful,
    he would not have excluded the evidence because Det. Cst. Lee was acting in
    good faith and made “an honest and understandable mistake” in concluding he had
    grounds for the appellant’s continued detention. Although the breaches of the
    appellant’s <em>Charter</em> rights would have been significant, so was society’s
    interest in adjudication of the case on its merits. The trial judge concluded
    that a <em>Grant</em> analysis would have favoured admission. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Issues</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raised the following grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> the trial judge erred in concluding that the arrest did not become
    unlawful after the appellant produced the medical marijuana licence;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> the trial judge ought to have excluded the drug and firearm evidence.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=Heading>Overview of the regulatory regime</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the decriminalization of the possession of marijuana for non-medical
    purposes in 2018, the regulatory regime governing possession of marijuana for
    medical purposes was continually in flux. At the time of the appellant’s arrest,
    possession of marijuana remained an offence, with an exemption for medical use set
    out by the <em>Regulations</em>. The <em>Regulations</em> were repealed in 2018
    when Parliament enacted the <em>Cannabis Act</em>, S.C. 2018, c. 16.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Regulations</em> established a regime in which health care practitioners
    could authorize persons under their professional treatment to possess and consume
    specified quantities of cannabis as part of that professional treatment: <em>Regulations</em>,
    ss. 3, 7, and 8. Section 7 required health care practitioners to provide a “medical
    document” to persons under their treatment. Section 8 required the document to
    set out the practitioner’s contact and professional registration number, the
    name and contact details of the person under their care, and the daily quantity
    of marijuana that the person was authorized to use over a specified time
    period. Section 8(4) required the medical document to be signed and dated by
    the practitioner providing the document.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    person furnished with a s. 8 medical document authorizing use of marijuana
    would be eligible to apply to a licensed producer to be registered as a client
    of that producer: <em>Regulations</em>, s. 130. An applicant would be required
    to provide the producer with the applicant’s original medical document and
    certify the accuracy of the information it contained.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the applicant was accepted as a client, the producer would be required to
    provide the client with a “registration document” containing information
    including the name of the producer, the name of the client, the client’s date
    of birth and address, and a unique identifier number: <em>Regulations</em>, s.
    133.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Regulations</em> established labelling requirements to be attached to the
    container of the marijuana products provided to the client. This included a
    label stating, among other things, the name, telephone number, and email
    address of the producer: <em>Regulations</em>, s. 84(1). Additionally, the
    producer was required to attach a client label stating the client’s name, the
    name of the health care professional who provided the client’s medical
    document, the name of the licenced producer, and the authorized quantity as set
    out on the client’s medical document. The producer was also required to provide
    the client with a separate copy of the client label: <em>Regulations</em>, 87(1)(b).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    person authorized to possess marijuana under the <em>Regulations</em> was
    required, on demand, to “demonstrate to a police officer that the possession or
    production is authorized”: <em>Regulations</em>, s. 15. Similarly, a licenced
    producer was obligated, at the request of the police, to disclose whether a
    person was a client of the producer and what substance and daily quantity was authorized
    by the medical document issued to that person: <em>Regulations</em>, s. 121(1). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Regulations</em> did not specify what would constitute a sufficient
    demonstration that a person’s possession of marijuana was authorized. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Issue 1: the s. 8 and 9 violations </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge explained, police officers have the authority, under s.&nbsp;495(1)
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, to arrest a person
    without warrant if they have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the
    person has committed an indictable offence. The Crown bears the burden of
    establishing that the arrest was lawful: <em>R. v. Gerson-Foster</em>, 2019
    ONCA 405, 437 C.R.R. (2d) 193, at para. 75. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the arrest to be lawful, the officer must subjectively believe there are
    grounds for arrest, and those grounds must be “justifiable from an objective
    point of view”: <em>R. v. Storrey</em>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241, at pp. 250-51; <em>R.
    v. Canary</em>, 2018 ONCA 304, 361 C.C.C. (3d) 63, at para. 21. The officer’s
    belief will be objectively reasonable if a reasonable person, with the
    officer’s knowledge, experience and training, assessing the totality of the
    circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest, could have
    concluded that there were grounds to arrest the appellant: <em>R. v. Storrey</em>,<em> </em>at pp 250-51; <em>R. v. Debot</em>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, at p. 1168; <em>R.
    v. Canary</em>, at para. 22; and <em>R. v. Stairs</em>, 2020 ONCA 678, 153 O.R.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that Det. Cst. Lee believed the appellant to have committed
    the offence of unlawful possession of marijuana. The issue before this court is
    whether the trial judge erred by finding that the <a name="_Hlk89347871">officer’s
    belief was objectively reasonable </a>in light of the appellant’s exculpatory
    explanation and production of the MedReleaf card. The trial judge’s finding is
    reviewable on a standard of correctness: <em>R. v. Shepherd</em>, 2009 SCC 35, [2009]
    2 S.C.R. 527, at para. 20.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Det.
    Cst. Lee was ultimately wrong in concluding that the MedReleaf Card was
    inauthentic, and wrong in concluding that the appellant was not licenced to
    possess marijuana sourced from MedReleaf. Det. Cst. Lee’s mistaken conclusions
    did not necessarily render his belief objectively unreasonable. An officer is
    entitled to rely on conclusions based on a reasonable belief that certain facts
    exist even if that belief turns out to be mistaken: <em>R. v. Robinson</em>,
    2016 ONCA 402, 336 C.C.C. (3d) 22, at para. 40.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    was also under no obligation to accept or investigate every exculpatory
    explanation offered by the appellant: <em>R. v. Chehil</em>, 2013 SCC 49,
    [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, at para. 34, but he was obliged to consider all
    information before him, including the degree to which the MedReleaf card
    supported the appellant’s explanation, unless he had “good reason” to believe
    it to be unreliable: <em>R. v. Golub</em> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont.
    C.A.), at para. 21, leave to appeal refused, (1998), [1997] S.C.C.A. No. 571.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I explain below, the reasons given by Det. Cst. Lee for concluding that the
    appellant was unlawfully in possession of marijuana do not hold up to scrutiny.
    He admitted on cross-examination that what he believed to be indicia of
    recreational marijuana use – the presence of multiple grinders, flakes of
    marijuana on the console of the car, Blackwoods cigars – were equally
    consistent with use for medical purposes. Similarly, his reasons for concluding
    the MedReleaf card was “fake” – that it was old, dirty, did not have a user
    photo, and was similar to other fake licences in an unspecified respect – are
    not just incorrect, but unjustifiable. There was no explanation as to how the
    officer thought the physical condition of the card – old, dirty – could bear on
    its authenticity. Neither does the officer’s evidence that this card appeared
    similar to other fake cards he had seen provide good reason to believe the card
    was not what it purported to be. None of the specific indicia of inauthenticity
    that he had observed in his experience applied to this card: it was not issued
    by an American dispensary nor by one of the Toronto dispensaries known by Det.
    Cst. Lee to be operating illegally. Det. Cst. Lee’s belief that this card otherwise
    appeared similar to fake cards he had previously seen (based on criteria he did
    not articulate) presupposed that those comparators were in fact fake. But given
    Det. Cst. Lee’s ignorance of the content of the <em>Regulations </em>– and
    specifically the forms of documentation they contemplated – his prior judgments
    about the authenticity of cards he had seen did not offer a secure baseline for
    comparison and could not be safely relied on. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Det.
    Cst. Lee’s final reason for believing the card to be fake was his expectation
    that a licenced user of marijuana would be given a government issued licence
    with, in his words, a government logo and photograph. This was based on an
    incorrect assumption about the operation of the <em>Regulations</em>. In
    reality, the <em>Regulations</em> did not make any provision for a formal
    license to be carried by the user, as, for example, the <em>Firearms Licences
    Regulations</em>, SOR/98-199 make provision for a formal license to be
    possessed by a person possessing a firearm. Det. Cst. Lee applied an irrelevant
    criterion in assessing the authenticity of the MedReleaf card.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was
    his mistaken belief about the state of the law nevertheless reasonable?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is important to be precise about the nature of Det. Cst. Lee’s error. This was
    not an error about the state of the law similar to that in <em>R. v. Tim</em>, 2020
    ABCA 469, 21 Alta. L.R. (7th) 95, leave to appeal granted and appeal heard and
    reserved October 7, 2021, [2021] S.C.C.A. No. 11, where a majority of the
    Alberta Court of Appeal held that an officer could not be faulted for wrongly believing
    that a particular drug was one of the approximately 300 drugs listed on the Appendix
    of the <em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c. 19. Neither
    was it an error arising out of the competing interpretations of common law
    powers, or of the intricacies of applying law to novel situations. The officer
    was uninformed of how the <em>Regulations</em> functioned, and in the place of
    that knowledge, proceeded on the basis of what he assumed the law might be,
    based on what the Ontario legislature and Canadian Parliament had enacted in
    regulating other matters. Det. Cst. Lee made frequent reference in his
    testimony to his experience applying other regulatory regimes, including the
    firearms and prescription pharmaceutical control regimes. This experience was
    relied on by the trial judge to establish the reasonableness of Det. Cst. Lee’s
    mistaken assumption that a valid card would be government-issued with similar
    features. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    this chain of reasoning is relevant to the assessment of the officer’s conduct
    in the s. 24(2) analysis below, I do not agree that it renders his mistaken
    belief in the state of the law objectively reasonable. Although he was able to anticipate
    some aspects of the scheme – that a user would be provided with a prescription
    as well as personalized packaging from a licenced supplier, and this could be
    used to demonstrate authorized possession – he was entirely mistaken about
    others, particularly the government issue of a form of licence. Given the
    multiplicity of means that governments use to implement regulatory schemes, it
    was not objectively reasonable for the officer to proceed on the basis of
    assumptions about how the scheme might work. </p>
  <p class=LHeading11>The search of the car</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    that the arrest was unlawful, so too was the search incident to arrest. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded by the Crown’s argument that the search was justified because
    the officer needed to determine whether the appellant was in possession of more
    marijuana than he claimed to be entitled to possess. Such a search may have
    been justified if there were some reason to suspect that the appellant had more
    than the prescribed quantity in his possession. Here, there was no reason to
    suspect there was more marijuana to be found. Were the Crown’s argument
    accepted, it would authorize a search of any vehicles, premises, and the person
    of everyone asserting an authorization to possess controlled substances in
    limited quantities. Such a proposition has no support in the law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant’s arrest did
    not infringe his right to be free from arbitrary detention under s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>,
    or that the search of the vehicle and of the appellant consequent to arrest
    were unreasonable per s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em>.  As a consequence, both the
    search of the vehicle and the search of his person consequent to arrest constituted
    unreasonable searches per s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. </p>
  <p class=Heading>S. 24(2) </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the s. 24(2) analysis established that the handgun,
    ammunition, magazine, and drugs discovered should be admitted into evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    no deference is owed to the trial judge’s conclusion given his conclusion that
    there was no <em>Charter </em>violation, deference is owed to the factual
    findings he made relevant to that conclusion. Those factual findings should not
    be disturbed absent error in principle, palpable and overriding factual error,
    or an unreasonable determination. As I explain below, although I disagree with
    some of his analysis regarding the seriousness of the state conduct, I agree that
    the admission of the evidence would not, in the circumstances, bring the
    administration of justice into disrepute. I would dismiss the appeal on this
    ground.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    determining whether the evidence should be excluded, the three-part inquiry
    mandated in <em>R. v. Grant</em>, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, at para. 71
    applies: (1) the seriousness of the <em>Charter</em>-infringing conduct of the
    police, (2) the impact on the <em>Charter</em>-protected interests of the
    appellant; and (3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its
    merits.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Supreme Court of Canada held in <em>Grant</em>, at para. 70, “s. 24(2)’s
    focus is societal. Section 24(2) is not aimed at punishing the police or
    providing compensation to the accused, but rather at systemic concerns. The s.
    24(2) focus is on the broad impact of admission of the evidence on the
    long-term repute of the justice system.”  </p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Seriousness of the state conduct</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge noted, at this stage of the analysis the court must consider
    whether the admission of the evidence would send a message to the public that
    courts condone state deviation from the rule of law by failing to dissociate
    themselves from the fruits of unlawful conduct: <em>Grant</em>, at para. 72. The
    “more severe or deliberate the state conduct … the greater the need for courts
    to dissociate … by excluding [the] evidence”: <em>Grant</em>, at para. 72.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the arrest and the searches were performed “honestly
    and in good faith” and the breaches were based on “an honest and understandable
    mistake by the police.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the officers acted honestly and without bad faith – but an absence
    of bad faith does not necessarily equate to a finding of good faith: <em>R. v.
    Le</em>, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 147. The lack of training
    provided by the Toronto Police Service on the <em>Regulations</em> was an
    institutional failing. A police officer who uses his best guess at the content
    of <em>Regulations</em>, relying on his experience to form conclusions about
    what they likely provide, is not acting in a “manner…consistent with what [he]
    subjectively, reasonably, and non-negligently believe[d] to be the law”: <em>R.
    v. Le</em>, at para. 147. Viewed from the perspective of the “long-term repute
    of the justice system,” the officer ought to have been able to recognize the
    card as legitimate, ought to have understood its evidentiary value in the
    scheme of the <em>Regulations</em>, and ought to have known rather than assumed
    that there would be packaging and a client label associated with the marijuana
    in the appellant’s possession.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the police conduct, both institutionally and individually, cannot be described
    as good faith, the actions of Det. Cst. Lee nevertheless lie at the less
    serious end of the fault spectrum. The regulations governing the use of
    marijuana were not static but continually in flux during this period: <em>R. v.
    Spencer</em>, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at para. 77. His <em>Charter </em>breach
    was not deliberate, and Det. Cst. Lee applied what he genuinely believed the
    law would require based on his experience as a police officer. To a degree, his
    expectation of what the law would require – that the user would be provided
    with packaging and a prescription similar in nature to what a user of
    pharmaceutical drugs would be given - was correct. In this overall context, the
    breach is less serious. As in <em>R. v. Omar</em>, 2018 ONCA 975, 144 O.R. (3d)
    1<em>, per</em> Brown J.A. (dissenting), rev’d 2019 SCC 32, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 576,
    the trial judge’s key finding was not that the officer acted in good faith, but
    that the officer’s conduct fell at the less serious end of the spectrum.
    Accordingly, I conclude that this factor weighs towards inclusion of the
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Impact of the Charter violations</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the second prong of the <em>Grant</em> analysis, the court must consider the
    extent to which the breaches impacted the <em>Charter</em>-protected interests
    of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge rightly noted, the appellant “had a significantly reduced
    expectation of privacy” in his car, which supported the admissibility of the
    handgun, the magazine, and the ammunition. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in his analysis of the second prong
    by failing to consider the additional impact of the s. 9 violation in that
    analysis, and that had he done so, he would have concluded that the second
    factor also moved towards exclusion of the handgun, magazine, and ammunition. I
    do not agree. There was no adjudication of the question of whether the
    appellant would have been able to make an adequate demonstration of his
    authorization to possess marijuana purchased from MedReleaf. On the evidence presented
    on the <em>voir dire</em> it is unlikely that he could have. Presentation of
    the card by itself – unaccompanied by the product packaging with the client
    label – would not likely have been accepted as sufficient. The search of the
    vehicle did not produce any product packaging. Under these circumstances, there
    could well have been grounds for arrest, notwithstanding that the appellant had
    a valid client card. So although the trial judge did not expressly mention the
    s. 9 violation in his analysis of this step of the test, considering that
    violation would not change the result of the analysis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    low expectation of privacy the appellant had in the motor vehicle, coupled with
    the unlikelihood that the appellant could have demonstrated his authorization
    to possess the marijuana bears on the impact of the subsequent strip search on the
    appellant’s <em>Charter </em>rights. Typically strip searches imply a serious
    infringement of privacy and personal dignity: <em>R. v. Golden</em>, 2001 SCC
    83, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 679, at paras. 98-99. But given that the appellant would
    likely have been arrested in any event and subjected appropriately to a strip
    search after the discovery of the firearm and ammunition, the seriousness of
    this violation is significantly attenuated. </p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Truth finding function of the trial </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final prong of the <em>Grant</em> analysis “asks whether the truth-seeking
    function of the criminal trial process would be better served by admission of
    the evidence, or by its exclusion”: <em>Grant</em>, at para. 79. The
    reliability and importance of the evidence are serious considerations at this
    phase of the analysis. Here, there is nothing in the manner in which the
    evidence was obtained that undermines its accuracy or the fairness of the
    trial. It is real evidence and highly reliable. Exclusion of it would
    effectively terminate the prosecution: <em>Grant</em>, at paras. 79-84.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was alive to these factors and found it “important to recall … that
    the City of Toronto and the greater Toronto area continue to be troubled by gun
    violence and drug trafficking – offences which seem all too frequently to be
    committed in tandem, and often with tragic results.” The trial judge found that
    exclusion of reliable evidence, essential to a prosecution of very serious
    offences, would bring the admission of justice into disrepute, and that this
    factor favours the admission of the cocaine, the ammunition, the magazine, and
    the handgun. I see no basis to interfere with this finding.</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Conclusion on s. 24(2) </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge, taking all of the above factors into account, determined that the
    evidence ought to be admitted. Although I disagree with his characterization of
    the state conduct at the first stage of the analysis, I nevertheless come to
    the same conclusion that that step in the analysis favours admission of the
    evidence, and that a consideration of all the factors together in the
    circumstances of this case lead to the conclusion that the evidence be
    admitted. </p>
  <p class=Heading>DISPOSITION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would find that the trial judge erred in not finding a violation of the rights
    of the appellant under s. 8 and s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>, but did not err
    in admitting the evidence under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. Accordingly, I
    would dismiss the appeal against conviction. The appeal of sentence was not argued
    before us and I would dismiss the appeal of sentence as abandoned.</p>
