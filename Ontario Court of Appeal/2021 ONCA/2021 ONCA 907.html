  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>By the
    Court:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jack Ganz Consulting Ltd. (“JGC”) brought a claim for breach of contract
    against Recipe Unlimited Corporation, formerly known as Cara Operations Limited
    (“Cara”). JGC claimed that the respondent, Cara breached its signed and
    executed consulting agreement of March 10, 2006 (“the Agreement”). JGC claimed damages,
    including damages for lost stock options, and common law reasonable notice on
    the basis that JGC was a dependent contractor.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cara brought a motion for summary judgment. The motion judge granted the
    motion for summary judgment, dismissing JGC’s action for breach of contract and
    failure to provide common law reasonable notice and other ancillary relief. We
    do not agree with the conclusion that there is no genuine issue requiring a
    trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While it is clear that until October 31, 2014 there
    was a contractual arrangement in effect between the parties to engage the
    services of JGC, it is not clear whether and to what extent the terms in the March
    10, 2006 Agreement were still in effect, save for the fact that JGC would
    continue to bill for its services on the terms set out in the Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We find there is a genuine issue for trial as to the terms of the contractual
    arrangement between the parties at the time JGC’s services were terminated by
    Cara and the rights and obligations flowing therefrom.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, for reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal, set aside
    the summary judgment and remit the matter for trial.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE EVIDENCE</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jack Ganz was the principal of JGC which offered information technology (“IT”)
    services.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In March 2006, his firm was retained to assist Cara with IT
    infrastructure in accordance with the terms of a written consulting Agreement
    dated March 10, 2006. </p>
  <p class=Heading><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Relevant Terms of the
    2006 Agreement</span></u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>The Agreement stipulated that JGC was an independent
    contractor who</span> would be paid an annual consulting fee of $420,000 to
    provide IT consulting services and an additional $250 per hour for each
    additional hour that services were required in excess of 180 hours.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Agreement also provided that if Cara became a public corporation
    with shares listed on a public stock exchange and offered an employee equity
    incentive plan, JGC would have the opportunity to participate in the plan on
    the same terms and conditions offered to its other senior management level
    employees.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement contained an automatic renewal of the three-year term “<span
lang=EN-CA>unless terminated prior to the expiration date in accordance with
    this Agreement</span>”:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>2.01   </span><b><u><span lang=EN-CA>Term</span></u></b><span
lang=EN-CA>. The term of this Consulting Agreement shall commence on the date hereof
    and shall continue for a period of three consecutive (3) years thereafter. This
    Agreement shall automatically be renewed for additional three consecutive (3)
    year terms unless terminated prior to the expiration date in accordance with
    this Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>The relevant termination, amendment and waiver provisions in the Agreement
    are as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>5.03   <b><u>Termination upon expiration</u></b>.
    Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon the expiration
    of three (3) years from commencement by written notice to the other to be given
    at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of this
    Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Corporation
    terminates this Agreement, the Consultant shall have the right to extend this
    Agreement, with fees as detailed in section 2.01, for a further twelve (12)
    months following the date of expiration.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>5.04   <b><u>Continuing Obligations upon
    Termination</u></b>. […] The Corporation shall have no further obligations
    under this Consulting Agreement upon termination under Section 5.03 above,
    except to pay for services provided by the Consultant prior to termination.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[…]</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>6.06   <b><u>Amendments
    and Waivers</u></b>.    No amendment to this Consulting Agreement shall be
    valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the parties.
    No waiver of any breach of any term or provision of this Consulting Agreement
    shall be effective or binding unless in writing and signed by the parties, nor
    shall any such waiver be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or
    conditions at the same or at any prior to subsequent time.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Arrangement Between
    the Parties After August 2008</span></u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 29, 2008 (12 days before the deadline
    to give notice that the Agreement would not be renewed), Steve Smith,
    then-Chief Financial Officer of Cara, met with Ganz. According to Smith, the
    purpose of the meeting was “to discuss the existing agreement and next steps
    with respect to that agreement” because “if Cara wanted to change the contract,
    it had to be done prior to six months otherwise it was an automatic renewal clause.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following the meeting, Ganz sent an email to
    Smith advising him that,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It was a pleasure meeting with you today. I
    look forward to working with you and know the future is exciting. Let this
    email serve to remove the <b>auto renewal</b> from my contract. I look forward to
    our discussions, in early 2009, after the new HQ moves and Data Centre builds
    quiet down. [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ganz confirmed that the words “auto renewal”
    refer to s. 2.01 of the Agreement. He stated however that this served to remove
    all of s. 2.01 of the Agreement (including the first sentence, which provided
    that the agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue for a
    period of three consecutive years thereafter). He therefore takes the position
    that this was an agreement of indefinite term, terminable on 180 days’ notice pursuant
    to s. 5.03.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Smith responded to Ganz on September 2, 2008 that,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I too look forward to discussing with you the
    terms of our new arrangement that will take effect after your current agreement
    with Cara comes to an end in March 2009.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 2, 2008, Smith also sent an email
    to Cara’s in-house counsel, confirming that he and Ganz discussed the March
    2009 expiration of the Agreement and the 6-month notice period to avoid
    automatic renewal, and that “we will come to a mutually agreeable position on a
    new agreement closer to the expiration date.” Smith advised that he had also told
    Ganz that there was an immediate need for a waiver of the automatic renewal
    clause as a result of Cara’s changing needs or for an equivalent notice letter
    from Smith to Ganz indicating that the current agreement would not be renewed
    under its current terms and would be allowed to expire.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In early 2009, the parties met to discuss the
    terms of a new arrangement. Smith sent an email to Ganz on January 26, 2009
    saying that the “[c]urrent agreement between Jack and Cara expires as scheduled
    March, 2009” and summarizing terms for a new agreement. Smith asked Ganz to
    advise if there was anything that he missed and recorded that Ganz had “no
    additional comments to add.” No new agreement was signed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Draft terms were again communicated in May 2010,
    and March 2012. The recitals in those draft agreements which were never signed
    provide that, “the parties hereto and to the Original Agreement, hereby
    mutually agree that the Original Agreement terminated fully effective midnight
    March 5, 2010, save and except for the Continuing Obligations upon Termination
    set out in section 5.04 of the Original Agreement.” Ganz struck all references
    to the “Original Agreement” from the draft agreements exchanged by the parties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Throughout the eight-year relationship, Ganz
    submitted his invoices with the words: “As per Agreement dated March-10-2006”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At one point, Cara suggested that Ganz’s
    remuneration be reduced to approximately $10,416.66 per month and that his
    hours be reduced. However, the original amount set out in the Agreement
    continued to be paid to Ganz until 2014, when the services of JGC were no
    longer required.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><u><span lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>Evidence From
    Cara Representatives as to Whether the Agreement Was Terminated</span></u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Smith left Cara in 2013. He was examined
    pursuant to r. 39.03 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 194, by a Summons to Witness served by Cara.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When asked on examination, whether the Agreement
    was terminated, Smith said: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>A. This is definitely part of the grey
    area.</span></u></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. Part of the grey area. And what do you mean
    by grey area?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. <u>I mean that the question would arise,
    was the original agreement terminated or not</u>? What role does Sean Reagan
    [sic] play going forward? What does the new agreement with Jack Ganz look like? <u>There were a number of open-ended things and we continued to move along
    business as usual until we sorted that out</u>. So we were in a very grey area
    as to where exactly we stood with respect to that contract. That's what I mean.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. The grey area was the Robinson instruction
    to keep Ganz in place.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. And what that -- yes, and the ergo to that
    is what does that look like going forward and is it a continuation or is it a
    new contract or what is it? That was totally uncertain and Don left it that
    way. Our responsibility was to keep things going so we did in that time of
    uncertainty.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. So therefore, you and Mr. Ganz understood
    that post-March '09 nothing would change in relationship to his arrangements.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. No, I can't say that. That's part of the
    grey area. I don't know. We were not given clarity from Don. <u>All Don said
    was, &quot;Jack can’t<span style='color:black'> leave the business. I
    understand, Steve, you need to cut costs. Find a way to work with Jack to keep
    him in the business and keep IT running and you two sort out what that might
    look like going forward</span></u><span style='color:black'>.” [Emphasis

    that we should find a way of dealing with the cost of the contract.”</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Smith later testified that the termination of
    the Agreement and the development of a new agreement were “inextricably linked.”
    Smith agreed that it was a “fine line to walk” to try to modify Ganz’s
    agreement without allowing or enabling Ganz’s whole team to walk away at a
    crucial time. Neither he nor Robinson nor Regan wanted Ganz or his team to
    leave Cara.</span></p>

    senior vice-president and principal shareholder, did not want anything changed in
    Ganz’s contract at any time as Regan felt that Ganz was essential to the
    overall plan to build the company and become a public company.</span></p>

    2006 to the time JGC was advised their services were no longer required in October
    2014, JGC invoiced Cara monthly for the $35,000 monthly fee set out in the
    Agreement. Throughout that time, all of JGC’s invoices read, “As per the

    damages in the sum of $2,000,000 representing reasonable notice at common law

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge held that there was no genuine
    issue for trial and granted Cara’s motion for summary judgment, dismissing JGC’s
    action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the motion judge found the automatic
    renewal provision in s. 2.01 of the Agreement was waived by Ganz. The Agreement
    was therefore terminated on March 9, 2009, subject to JGC’s right to extend it
    for a period of 12 months to March 9, 2010.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At paras. 102-4 of her reasons, the motion judge
    held that after the termination of the Agreement in 2009 and the 12-month
    extension period ended in March 2010:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Based on the evidence on this motion, the
    arrangement appears to have been </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>ad hoc</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. The only terms that are evidenced by the parties’ conduct is that
    JGC would continue to provide services and Cara would continue to pay the
    amount under the Consulting Agreement, until the parties agreed otherwise.
    Those were the essential terms. The parties’ conduct does not evince a mutual
    intent to be bound beyond those terms, for example, on the length of the
    engagement or when and how the arrangement could be terminated. There is no
    evidence of any agreement that further terms from the Consulting Agreement
    would apply, specifically, JGC’s ability to participate in the employee
    incentive plan.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There is little evidence to support Cara’s
    position that the parties agreed to a month to month arrangement. Mr. Ganz
    referred to the NetOps Group’s arrangement as month to month. However, there
    was never any contract for the NetOps services. There was no mention of “month
    to month” in relation to JGC in the documentary evidence until an email from
    Mr. Grondin dated September 3, 2014. By that time, Cara was transitioning JGC
    out. In his examination, Mr. Smith acknowledged that if the parties had a month
    to month arrangement, JGC could have left with a month’s notice.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Contrary to JGC’s position, however, Cara is
    not required to demonstrate no genuine issue requiring a trial as to whether
    there was a month to month arrangement in order to succeed on its motion. It is
    sufficient that Cara demonstrate that, due to the waiver of the Renewal Clause,
    the Consulting Agreement expired in March 2010 and that no other written
    agreement was struck to take its place.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge also found that Ganz was not a
    dependent contractor, and, in any event, his claim for common law reasonable
    notice was statute barred under s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act</em>, <i>2002</i>,
    S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched. B, because it was commenced more than two years after
    the cause of action arose. The motion judge noted that neither JGC’s original
    nor amended pleadings alleged a breach of the duty of good faith, which served
    to demonstrate that the dependent contractor claim was very different from
    JGC’s original breach of contract claim, and thus statute barred.</span></p>

    choice has full knowledge of the right and makes an unequivocal and conscious
    decision to forego that right with full understanding of the consequences. The
    court must apply a stringent test before finding unilateral waiver of a
    contractual right because “no consideration moves from the party in whose
    favour a waiver operates. An overly broad interpretation of waiver would

    waiver by JGC of the auto renewal provision in the Agreement and that the waiver
    was accepted by Cara in Smith’s email of September 2008. She found that as a
    result, the Agreement was terminated effective March 2010 (including the

    Further, it is clear from the record, in particular the email exchange quoted
    at paras. 13 and 15 above, as well as the internal email quoted in para. 16,
    that in his discussion with Smith, Ganz was asked to remove the provision as a

    recognized that it was important to preserve the relationship with Ganz and JGC.
    What is not clear is whether and to what extent other terms in the Agreement
    were still in effect, other than the payment terms. For example, was the stock
    option provision still in effect? Was there a notice requirement and if so,
    what was it?</span></p>

    the contractual negotiations in the record and, in particular, evidence that
    verbal agreements were reached but not memorialized in correspondence or
    crystalized in a contract, there was simply not enough evidence to summarily

    at trial, the issues of whether Ganz was a dependent contractor, whether there
    was a breach of good faith, whether the limitation period expired, and what right
    to remuneration may flow from these determinations, should be addressed by the
    trial judge once all of the evidence has been adduced and assessed.</span></p>
