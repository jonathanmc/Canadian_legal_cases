  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A discharge from bankruptcy releases the insolvent
    debtor from pre-bankruptcy debts or liabilities<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
    subject to certain exceptions. One exception, under s. 178(1)(e) of the <em>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
    B-3</span></em> (the <em>BIA</em>) is any debt or liability resulting from
    obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent
    misrepresentation. That kind of debt or liability is not released, and thus
    remains enforceable against the debtor post-bankruptcy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent, Shaver-Kudell Manufacturing
    Inc., successfully sued the appellant, Alexander Knecht, and others, for
    misappropriating the respondents trade secrets and confidential information. The
    quantum of the damages and the granting of other relief was to be determined at
    a subsequent hearing. However, before that could occur, the appellant made a
    proposal to his creditors under the <em>BIA</em>, which automatically stayed the
    proceedings. The proposal was rejected by a majority of those creditors; the
    appellant was, as a consequence, deemed to have made an assignment into
    bankruptcy, continuing the stay.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the decision under appeal, the motion judge declared
    that the debt or liability under the trial judgment arose from the appellant
    having obtained property or services by false pretences, and thus would survive
    the appellants discharge from bankruptcy. He also declared that the stay that
    the <em>BIA</em> imposes on proceedings or enforcement steps against a bankrupt
    did not apply to the respondents claims against the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the
    motion judge erred in law in coming to the conclusion that the debt or
    liability arising under the trial judgment falls within s. 178(1)(e) of the <em>BIA</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the core of the concept of false pretences is
    the making of a deceitful statement  that is, a statement that is false to the
    knowledge of its maker (including through wilful blindness or recklessness). For
    s. 178(1)(e) to apply, the debt or liability to the creditor must have resulted
    from the bankrupt having obtained property or services by making such a
    statement. The nature and substance of the liability of the appellant reflected
    in the trial judgment is not one that arose from such a statement. Although the
    liability arose from morally unacceptable conduct of the appellant, that is
    insufficient to fit it within the exception in s. 178(1)(e) of the <em>BIA</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would therefore set aside the declaration that
    s. 178(1)(e) applies to the debt or liability arising under the trial judgment.
    I would vary the declaration concerning the stay to provide that it is lifted
    to the extent necessary to allow the respondent to quantify its claim for the
    purpose of proving it in the appellants bankruptcy and to permit enforcement
    of any injunction granted, as described below.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2013, the respondent, a corporation that
    manufactures electric motor sleeves, commenced an action against four
    defendants: Dusko Ballmer and Lucy&nbsp;Shaver, who were former employees of
    the respondent; the appellant; and Knight Manufacturing Inc., a corporation of
    which the appellant was the controlling mind. The thrust of the claim was that
    the defendants went into business together making use of misappropriated trade
    secrets and confidential information of the respondent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The action was directed to proceed in a
    bifurcated manner. The determination of liability issues was to take place
    first, with damages and other relief to be determined at a later date.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> On August 7, 2018, following a 13-day trial,
    the trial judge found the defendants jointly and severally liable to the
    respondent for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of confidence: <em>Shaver-Kudell
    Manufacturing Inc. v. Knight Manufacturing Inc. et al</em>, 2018 ONSC 5206. The
    trial judge found:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>the respondent had developed a manufacturing process for its
    products and tooling that were trade secrets with the necessary quality of
    confidence;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>the respondent's trade secrets were acquired by Ms. Shaver and Mr.&nbsp;Ballmer
    in circumstances giving rise to an obligation of confidence; Mr. Ballmer then
    communicated the trade secrets to the appellant and Knight Manufacturing who
    knew or ought to have known that Mr. Ballmer and Ms. Shaver were breaching an
    obligation of confidence to the respondent; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>c.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>the defendants made unauthorized use of the respondent's trade
    secrets to its detriment, and also benefitted from the breach by Ms. Shaver of
    her duty of confidence and good faith to the respondent through her use of the respondent's
    confidential information, including her knowledge of the respondent's customers
    and their purchasing patterns and payment history, to solicit the respondent's
    customers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 19, 2018, the trial judge awarded
    costs against all of the defendants in the sum of $83,493 for a summary
    judgment motion, and $307,028 for the trial. They remain unpaid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial of the issue of damages and other
    relief has not yet been held.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant filed a Notice of Proposal to
    Creditors under the <em>BIA</em> on March&nbsp;2, 2020. On April 27, 2020, at a
    meeting of creditors, the proposal was rejected, resulting in the appellants
    deemed assignment into bankruptcy.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Motion Judges Decision</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent brought a motion seeking: (a) a
    declaration that any discharge from bankruptcy granted to the appellant will
    not release him from any debts or liabilities arising from the claims in the
    action against him by the respondent; and (b) a declaration that the stay under
    s. 69(1) of the <em>BIA</em> no longer operates with respect to the
    respondents claim against the appellant in the action. The motion judge
    granted the relief sought.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge began his analysis by
    considering the meaning of false pretences, the ground relied on by the respondent
    for the declaration it sought. He held that the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 361(1)</span></em> definition of false pretences should not be adopted to ascertain its meaning in
    s. 178(1)(e) of the <em>BIA</em>. He said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The purpose of the [<em>BIA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>]</span></em> is to relieve an honest and unfortunate
    debtor of their debts and liabilities, unless it falls under an exception set
    out in section 178 of the [<em>BIA</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>]</span></em>.
    Moreover, section 178(1)(e) of the [<em>BIA</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>]</span></em> has been described as a morality concept where one must
    look at the conduct and determine if it is unacceptable to society. It is not
    an exercise of determining the criminality of the conduct, and I do not believe
    that raising the requisite level of conduct to that of criminality was
    Parliaments intent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After reviewing certain authorities, the motion
    judge settled upon the following interpretation of the term false pretences
    as it is used in the <em>BIA</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is my view that a dishonest bankrupt who
    has unlawfully obtained property by lying satisfies the requirements of false
    pretences in section 178(1)(e). Such conduct is deceitful and wrong. It is
    this type of conduct that is morally objectionable to society. If the bankrupt
    engages in such a behaviour, they should not be shielded by bankruptcy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge then turned to a review of the
    pleadings and the trial judges findings. He noted there was no plea of fraud,
    but that the statement of claim described wrongful and morally unacceptable
    conduct, and that it was unnecessary that there be an exact plea in the
    statement of claim of circumstances described in s. 178(1). He then went on to summarize
    what he took from the trial judges reasons about the conduct of the appellant
    that brought it within s.&nbsp;178(1)(e) of the <em>BIA</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>He set up a business with individuals, [Mr.] Ballmer and [Ms. Shaver],
    who had proprietary knowledge of the [respondents] clients, manufacturing

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

    applies to both: see <em>Montréal (City) v. Deloitte Restructuring Inc.</em>,
    2021 SCC 53, at&nbsp;paras. 24-25. To the extent that they are not identical
    concepts, if any, it may be that fraudulent misrepresentation requires the creditor
    itself to have relied on a false statement made to it, while false pretences
    may extend to cases where a false statement was made by the debtor to, and
    relied on by, a third party, depriving the creditor of property to which it was

    bankruptcy legislation is to encourage the rehabilitation of an honest but unfortunate
    debtor by providing, subject to reasonable conditions, a discharge of their
    debts. Section 178(1) provides for certain debts to survive bankruptcy as exceptions
    to the general principle, stemming from different policy considerations. For
    example, the provisions of s. 178(1)(b) and (c), which provide that debts for
    support obligations are not released by bankruptcy, are rooted in an overriding
    social policy to protect spouses and children. Others, like ss. 178(1)(a.1), (d),
    and (e), are based on considerations of morality. Section 178(1)(e) is a moral
    sanction against the bankrupt for obtaining property through deceitful means,
    and prevents a bankrupt being rewarded for such conduct by a release of
    liability: <em>Simone v. Daley </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(1999)</span></em>,

    a whole supports reading s.&nbsp;178(1)(e) as applying to debts or liabilities

    it does not follow that all morally objectionable behaviour involves false

    statements by which property was obtained is not covered by s. 178(1)(e):</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In his judgment, Lederman, J., equated
    fraudulent removal by a tenant of his own property with false pretences or

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There is nothing in the record before either

    premises and removing stock. One can sympathize with Lederman, J.s, desire to
    give s. 178(1)(e) a broad interpretation as it is remedial legislation.
    However, such an interpretation must be anchored in the conduct proscribed by
    the provision. That conduct is false statements which the landlord did not

lang=EN-CA>The Motion Judge Did Not Find False Statements Within the Meaning of
    s. 178(1)(e) And Therefore Erred in Finding That the Debt or Liability Came
    Within It</span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judges list of findings by the trial
    judge (reproduced in para. 16 above) refers to only one incident of lying. The
    reference was to the appellant having lied on his examination for discovery.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although lying on examination for discovery
    reflects on whether the appellant was honest, it is not the type of false
    statement that satisfies s. 178(1)(e), which requires a deceitful statement by
    which the debtor obtained property or services, causing the debt or liability of
    the creditor to arise. By focusing on a lie told on examination for discovery,
    the motion judge failed to focus on whether false statements were the source of
    the liability.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A false statement on discovery may have damaged
    the appellants credibility in his unsuccessful attempt to fend off liability,
    but it is not the source of his liability. It is not a statement on the basis
    of which he obtained property or services. It could not make the liability one arising
    from obtaining property by false pretences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The balance of the motion judges list refers,
    to be sure, to morally objectionable commercial conduct  wrongfully
    appropriating and using trade secrets and confidential information. But, there
    is no suggestion that the misappropriation was committed by the appellant in a
    fiduciary capacity attracting s. 178(1)(d), and a misappropriation in another
    capacity cannot be brought within s. 178(1)(e) unless effected by deceitful
    statements. As was the case in <em>Buland</em>, conduct, although wrongful, that
    does not involve false statements is not captured by s. 178(1)(e).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The only other passage of the motion judges
    reasons germane to whether the liability reflected in the trial judgment was
    one that arose from the appellant obtaining property or services by false
    pretences is the motion judges observation that [m]anufacturing a sleeve that
    was copied and then selling it on the market as his own creation is clearly an
    attempt at making something that is not the case appear to be true.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the motion judge did not attribute the observation
    that the sleeves were sold as the appellants own creation to the trial judge.
    I can find no reference in the trial judges findings, and we were not pointed
    to anything in argument, that the appellant ever said anything to anyone in any
    manner about where the processes that led to making the sleeve came from in the
    course of manufacturing or selling the product. There was no finding that the
    appellant made a false statement to a customer to effect a sale, or that any
    customer relied on any such statement. Although a false statement need not be
    made expressly, and can be made by means other than words, the motion judge did
    not identify how a false statement on the basis of which the appellant obtained
    property or services could be implied here.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In effect, the motion judge took morally
    objectionable behaviour <a name="_Hlk90472166"></a> misappropriation of trade
    secrets  and implied deceit. But that approach does not respect the proper
    scope of s. 178(1)(e), which requires a deceitful statement as the source of
    the liability. If it were to be implied that every sale of a manufactured item
    carries with it an implicit representation that no third partys rights were
    infringed by the manufacturing process used, the scope of s. 178(1)(e) would be
    inappropriately expanded.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the absence of deceitful statements from
    which the liability arose, the motion judges findings that the appellant is not
    an honest but unfortunate debtor, or that his conduct was morally
    objectionable, are insufficient to bring the matter within s. 178(1)(e). I
    would therefore set aside the declaration the motion judge made that s.
    178(1)(e) applies to prevent the release of any debts or liabilities arising from
    claims in the action, including any outstanding or future costs award.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Did the Motion Judge Err in Declaring That the Stay Under s. 69 of
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>BIA</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> No Longer
    Operates?</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An order under s. 69.4 of the <em>BIA</em> declaring that a stay no longer operates is discretionary: <em>Fiorito v.
    Wiggins</em>, 2017 ONCA 765, 415 D.L.R. (4th) 562, at&nbsp;para.&nbsp;35, leave
    to appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 466. However, here the premise of the motion
    judges order was the erroneous legal conclusion that s.&nbsp;178(1)(e) applied
    to the appellants liability for the respondents claims. The declaration that
    the stay does not apply at all to the proceedings in the action as against the
    appellant or to enforcement of any judgment against the appellant cannot stand.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant agrees that the stay as it
    pertains to the claim in the action against him should nonetheless be lifted
    subject to conditions. The appellants proposed conditions would allow the respondents
    claim in the action to continue against him, but would prevent enforcement,
    other than as a claim in bankruptcy against the bankrupt estate, of any
    judgment against the appellant. The conditions would also insulate the
    appellant from any costs, production or discovery obligations if he does not
    further defend the action. The respondent takes issue with the extent of these proposed
    conditions, including because they would interfere with enforcement of the
    respondents claim against the appellant for return of equipment and injunctive
    relief against ongoing use of the trade secrets.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree that the stay should be lifted to allow
    the action to proceed against the appellant for the purpose of quantifying any
    damages or accounting of profits owing by the appellant, establishing the
    identity of any property still in the possession of the appellant that incorporates
    the trade secrets, and for any forward-looking injunctive relief against the
    appellant. Any monetary judgment shall only be a claim in bankruptcy against
    the bankrupt estate of the appellant and may not be otherwise enforced against
    the appellant. Any order for the return of any equipment in the possession of
    the appellant that was made using the trade secrets, and any injunctive relief
    that is granted against the appellant restraining any future use by him of the
    trade secrets may be enforced against him. The questions of whether the stay
    should be lifted to permit the respondent to seek any documentary or oral
    discovery from the appellant, or to enforce any future costs awards that arise
    from his continued participation in defending claims against him, are dependant
    on circumstances in the continuing action as they evolve. Accordingly, those
    issues are best left for determination by the Superior Court on a future
    motion, if required.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set
