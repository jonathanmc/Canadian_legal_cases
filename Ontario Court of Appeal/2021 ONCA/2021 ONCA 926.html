  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In May 2018, the applicant was charged with
    sexual assault, contrary to s.&nbsp;271(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. At the time of the alleged offence, he was on probation following
    a youth robbery conviction. He was released pending trial on house arrest bail
    (later varied to a midnight curfew) with his father as surety.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>His bail pending trial was not without incident.
    In September 2020, he was arrested in Thunder Bay for being unlawfully in a
    dwelling-house, drug trafficking, obstructing a peace officer, resisting a
    peace officer, and failing to comply with his release order. Following the
    September 2020 charges, he was again released on bail, under stricter house arrest
    conditions and with his mother as surety.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On December 10, 2020, the applicant was
    convicted of the sexual assault charge which is the subject of this appeal. On
    February 11, 2021, he was sentenced to two years less a day in custody,
    followed by two years’ probation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant appealed his conviction to this
    court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On February 11, 2021, the applicant was released
    on bail pending appeal on consent, on house arrest terms with exceptions for
    medical emergencies, while in the presence of one of his sureties, and for
    work, with his mother and his sister as sureties. At that time, he raised two
    grounds of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 3, 2021, the applicant pleaded guilty to
    the September 2020 charges (except that his plea was to the lesser offence of
    drug possession instead of trafficking). He was given a 7-month conditional
    sentence order followed by 12 months’ probation. These orders included the
    following term: “Do not attend the District of Thunder Bay”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 13, 2021, the applicant was arrested
    in Thunder Bay and charged with resisting a peace officer, uttering a forged
    document, failing to comply with his release order, and failing to comply with
    his probation order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 21, 2021, the applicant’s bail
    pending appeal was revoked as a result of the new charges.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 24, 2021, the applicant was granted
    bail on the October 2021 charges by a Justice of the Peace on terms whereby the
    applicant is to reside with his stepfather, who is to be his surety, with a
    financial commitment of $20,000, on house arrest terms.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant now applies for bail pending
    appeal on terms that mirror those put in place by the Justice of the Peace, but
    with a fivefold larger financial commitment ($100,000) by his surety, and a
    requirement that he wear an ankle bracelet so that he is subject, at his own
    expense, to GPS monitoring on a 24-hour basis.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown opposes the order, on the basis that

    his detention is not necessary in the public interest, having regard to both
    public safety and public confidence.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To obtain bail pending appeal, the applicant
    must establish that: (1) the appeal is not frivolous; (2) he will surrender
    himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the release order; and (3)
    his detention is not necessary in the public interest: <em>Code</em>, s.
    679(3)(a), (b) and (c).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the applicant has not established
    that the appeal passes the merits hurdle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant puts forward one ground of appeal
    as viable, having abandoned his other ground of appeal following the Supreme
    Court’s decision in <em>R. v. G.F.</em>, 2021 SCC 20, 71 C.R. (7th) 1. He argues
    that the trial judge erred in the manner in which he addressed the defence of
    honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent. Specifically, he argues
    that the trial judge approached the issue as a question of whether the defence had
    an air of reality, but applied the wrong test when he determined that it had no
    air of reality and was thus not a defence he would have left with a jury if he
    had been sitting with one.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant argues that in doing so, the trial
    judge confused the questions of threshold and ultimate reliability. The air of
    reality test does not ask whether there is credible evidence to support a defence.
    It asks whether there is any evidence which, if believed, could give rise to a
    reasonable inference that the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain the
    complainant’s consent. Only if there is no evidence concerning a defence can it
    be kept from the jury or rejected without further consideration. The applicant argues
    that his own evidence provided an ample evidentiary foundation which, if
    believed, could give rise to a reasonable doubt about whether he knew the
    complainant was not consenting.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are two problems with this argument.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the trial judge concluded that the
    defence did not apply for two independent reasons, only one of which was
    expressed in terms of an air of reality. His comments on the air of reality
    were expressed in the alternative to his primary conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge first held that the defence did
    not apply because he found as a fact that the only communication the applicant received
    from the complainant was of non-consent. Section 273.2(c) of the <em>Code</em> precludes
    belief in consent being a defence where </span><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>“</span><span lang=EN-CA>there is no evidence that the
    complainant’s voluntary agreement to the activity was affirmatively expressed
    by words or actively expressed by conduct.” In coming to his conclusion that
    there was no evidence of communicated consent (and in fact, only the opposite),
    the trial judge did not refer to the air of reality test. Accordingly, the
    suggested misapplication of that test does not affect this independent reason for
    rejecting the defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, this was a judge-alone trial. The trial
    judge was the arbiter of threshold and ultimate reliability. The trial judge
    applied the test in <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 741 and found that
    he did not believe the applicant; the applicant’s evidence did not give rise to
    a reasonable doubt; and that on the evidence he did accept, the Crown had
    proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is in that context that one must consider the
    applicant’s remaining argument. The trial judge as a second, alternative reason
    for rejecting the defence, held that the reasonable steps precondition to its
    application, found in s. 273.2(b) of the <em>Code</em>, was not met. He found
    that the applicant</span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> “</span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>did not take any steps, let alone
    reasonable ones, to determine whether [the complainant] was consenting to the
    sexual activity in question.” He observed that the applicant, on his own
    evidence, had taken no such steps. It was in respect of this basis for rejecting
    the defence that the trial judge stated that the defence had no air of reality and
    that he would not have left it with a jury if he were sitting with one.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>But assuming for the sake of argument that the trial
    judge did not respect the distinction between threshold reliability and
    ultimate reliability in stating whether the defence had an air of reality, the
    arbiter of ultimate reliability in this case was the trial judge. Even if as a
    threshold matter there was evidence of the applicant which, if believed, could
    show reasonable steps were taken, as an ultimate matter, there was no such
    evidence, as the trial judge made a clear finding that he did not believe the applicant’s
    evidence, and that it did not raise a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>G.F.</em>, the majority of the Supreme
    Court stressed the importance of a functional and contextual reading of a lower
    court’s reasons and directed appellate courts to resist the temptation to
    finely parse a judge’s reasons in search of error: at para. 69. In my view, a
    functional and contextual reading of these reasons can only lead to the
    conclusion that notwithstanding the use of the air of reality terminology, the
    reasonable steps precondition to the availability of the defence was rejected
    on the evidence that it was the trial judge’s job to ultimately assess.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant also argued that the trial judge
    had the wrong focus when considering the defence. The trial judge found that
    the <em>actus reus</em> had been made out because the complainant lacked
    capacity to consent. Therefore, the trial judge should have looked at whether
    the applicant had an honest but mistaken belief as to the complainant’s capacity
    to consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Capacity is a precondition to consent: <em>G.F.</em>,
    at para. 43. The defence is an honest but mistaken belief in communicated
    consent, not just a belief that the precondition to consent existed. Accordingly,
    the basis on which the trial judge found the <em>actus reus</em> was met did
    not restrict what had to be present for the defence to apply. The trial judge’s
    findings negated the defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Whether an appeal meets the standard of “not
    frivolous” is a low bar: <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Oland</em>, 2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1
    S.C.R. 250, at para. 20. However, in my respectful view, the applicant’s ground
    of appeal does not meet it.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>CONCLUSION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In light of my conclusion on the merits of the
    appeal, it is unnecessary to consider whether the applicant has satisfied the other
    aspects of his onus. The application is dismissed.</span></p>
