  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>The Convictions Under Appeal </span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The events which give rise to the convictions
    under appeal occurred on two separate occasions in 2018. The complainant was the
    applicant’s then domestic partner.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Three of the counts on which the applicant was
    convicted arose from events on May 28, 2018 — sexual assault, uttering threats to
    cause bodily harm (including a threat to choke the complainant to
    unconsciousness), and assault (involving hitting the back of the complainant’s
    head and breaking one of the complainant’s fingers). The fourth count related
    to events that took place in or around August&nbsp;2018 — an assault involving headbutting
    of the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant was charged with these offences on
    February 12, 2019. He was convicted on September 24, 2021 after a trial before
    a judge alone. (The applicant was acquitted on a fifth charge). On December 3,
    2021, the applicant was given a global sentence of two years less a day and
    three years’ probation.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>Other Offences Committed by the Applicant</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant has a criminal record with
    offences that both predate and postdate those at issue on his appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2005, he was convicted of obstruction of a
    peace officer and assault causing bodily harm. In 2006, he was convicted of
    uttering threats to cause death or bodily harm. In 2012, he was convicted of
    assault. In 2013, he was convicted of assault causing bodily harm, failure to
    comply with a probation order, and mischief under $5,000.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On December 3, 2018, the applicant pleaded
    guilty to other offences against the complainant: assault, forcible confinement,
    uttering threats, and mischief under $5,000. He was sentenced to 25 days in
    custody (in addition to 117 days of credit for pre-sentence custody), a 12-month
    conditional sentence order, and two years of probation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In May 2020, the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge
    that, in March 2020, he assaulted his current domestic partner, J.L. He also
    pleaded guilty to two counts of failure to comply with a probation order, and to
    one count that he failed, in April&nbsp;2020, to comply with a condition of his
    release order relating to J.L., namely the no-contact provision. He was
    sentenced to 18 days in custody followed by 18&nbsp;months of probation (with
    42 days of credit for pre-sentence custody).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 17, 2021, the applicant pleaded
    guilty to and was convicted of one count of breaching a no-contact order in
    relation to the complainant. He was sentenced to 45 days in custody.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>The Application for Bail Pending Appeal</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant applies for bail pending appeal to
    be effective when he is released from custody on the sentence he is currently
    serving for breach of the no-contact order relating to the complainant. He
    proposes J.L., his common-law partner, as his surety.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To obtain bail pending appeal, the applicant
    must establish that: (1) the appeal is not frivolous; (2) he will surrender
    himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the release order; and (3)
    his detention is not necessary in the public interest: <em>Code</em>, s.
    679(3)(a), (b) and (c).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown opposes the order, on the basis that
    the applicant has not met his onus to show that his detention is not necessary
    in the public interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The public interest ground requires
    consideration of two matters: public safety and public confidence in the
    administration of justice. The two are not completely independent. In some
    cases, even though the applicant may satisfy the public safety threshold,
    residual public safety concerns may remain to be considered in the public
    confidence analysis. That latter analysis involves balancing the reviewability
    interest (that a person is entitled to a meaningful review process before
    having to serve all or a substantial part of their sentence) and the
    enforceability interest (that judgments should be immediately enforceable). The
    balancing of these interests is to be measured through the eyes of a reasonable
    member of the public: <em>R. v. Oland</em>, 2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 250,
    at paras.&nbsp;23-27 and 47.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>The Enforceability Interest</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The enforceability interest in this case is
    animated by three considerations — the seriousness of the crimes, residual
    public safety concerns, and the applicant’s failure to follow court orders and
    terms of release.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The seriousness of the crime, including the
    gravity of the offence and the circumstances of its commission, plays an
    important role in the consideration of the enforceability interest, as public
    confidence in the administration of justice will be undermined if the person is
    released on bail pending appeal: <em>Oland</em>, at para.&nbsp;</span><span
lang=EN-CA>37</span><span lang=EN-CA>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The convictions under appeal are for offences committed

lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counts 1-3 relate to a prolonged violent
    incident in May 2018: the trial judge found that when the complainant refused
    to have sex with the applicant, the applicant put his hands around her throat,
    and threatened to choke her to unconsciousness unless she had sex with him. He
    then struck her repeatedly in the back of her head while she covered her face
    with her hands. At one point, he tore her phone from her hands, breaking her
    finger. He then forced vaginal intercourse on her as she was crying, knowing
    that she did not consent. The other count relates to an incident that occurred
    in or around August 2018: the trial judge found the applicant headbutted the
    complainant when she tried to escape the camper/trailer they were living in,
    and while she was pregnant.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>public safety concerns that “fall short of the substantial risk mark
    … remain relevant under the public confidence component” as a factor in favour
    of enforceability: <em>Oland</em>, at para. </span><span lang=EN-CA>39</span><span
lang=EN-CA>. Although the applicant’s criminal record before 2018 is dated, it
    includes convictions for offences that involve violence. More recently, </span><span
lang=EN-CA>the applicant was convicted of offences against the complainant, including
    assault and threats, that are not the subject of the appeal. He also has an
    even more recent conviction for assault against his current domestic partner,
    J.L.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant’s counsel argues that the violent
    offences all occurred before May of 2020, when the applicant was addicted to
    cocaine, and that he has made significant strides to conquer the addiction
    since then. However, the Pre-Sentence Report for his sentencing, dated November
    10, 2021, found that “standardized risk assessment tools place him at a high
    risk of reoffending, particularly in the area of domestic violence.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These kinds of concerns are in some cases
    attenuated by a strong history of compliance with bail terms pending trial, and
    by the release plan.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>But in this case, the applicant committed an
    offence against J.L. while awaiting trial on the offences under appeal. As
    well, he has a number of convictions for breach of probation and breach of the terms
    of his release.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As for the applicant’s release plan, J.L is
    prepared to serve as his surety, under a release plan that contemplates them
    living together. They have a child together, and she has three children from a
    prior relationship. She advised the Pre-Sentence Report writer that she no longer
    fears he would resort to violence against her and that he has a good
    relationship with her children. He is a source of financial support for her and
    them. The applicant and J.L. also both depose that he has successfully
    abstained from cocaine use in part due to J.L.’s encouragement and support. The
    applicant has started receiving medical counselling for his cocaine addiction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown expresses particular and marked concern
    about the release plan proffered by the applicant, given that the surety, J.L.,
    has been a recent victim of domestic violence by the applicant for which he was
    convicted in May 2020 (see above, at para. 9). The Crown argues that, among
    other things, the fact that J.L. is a victim of violence and is dependent on
    him for financial and childcare support raises a concern as to whether the
    applicant would abide by J.L.’s directions and whether she would feel safe to
    report any breach. This is significant, including because he has a history of
    breaches of court orders and release terms.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Generally, a victim of a bail applicant’s
    violence should not serve as surety: The Honourable Justice Gary T. Trotter, </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Law of Bail in Canada</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 3rd ed.
    (Toronto: Carswell, 2021) at 7:10. The applicant argues that J.L. has shown a
    willingness to report prior misconduct by the applicant, including against
    herself, and the evidence indicates she is a positive force in the applicant’s life.
    Accepting this evidence and that each case must be judged on its own facts, I nevertheless
    do not consider the other concerns that animate the enforceability interest set
    out above to be materially attenuated by the release plan, when it is viewed from
    the perspective of public confidence in the administration of justice.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>The Reviewability Interest</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Where the enforceability interest is thus
    engaged, weighing the reviewability interest requires a “more pointed
    consideration” of the strength of the appeal beyond the “very low bar” set by
    the “not frivolous” standard: <em>Oland</em>, at paras. </span><span
lang=EN-CA>20 and 40-41</span><span lang=EN-CA>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the appeal grounds, although rising
    above the “low bar” of being not frivolous, cannot be considered as clearly
    surpassing it. They each take issue with the trial judge’s processing of the
    evidence; findings of fact and credibility attract significant deference on
    appeal: <em>R. v. Radcliffe</em>, 2017 ONCA 176, 347&nbsp;C.C.C. (3d) 3, at
    para. 23, leave to appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 294.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge believed the complainant’s
    evidence. He did not believe the applicant, and found his evidence did not
    raise a reasonable doubt. He was satisfied on the evidence he did accept that
    the Crown had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the four counts on
    which he convicted the applicant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant argues that the trial judge
    employed stereotypes in rejecting the applicant’s evidence that the only sexual
    contact was initiated by the complainant, who pushed the applicant onto a chair
    and, against his will, performed oral sex on him while he protested, “This is
    wrong”. In my view, this will be a difficult argument. The trial judge noted
    that this description of what occurred was a change from the applicant’s
    previous two descriptions of the events given earlier in his own evidence, and
    that the applicant “was making this up”. Moreover, he found it difficult to
    believe that, given the size differential between them, the five foot one, 130-pound
    complainant could do this to an unwilling person who was approximately one foot
    taller and 100 pounds heavier. He considered the complainant’s version of the
    circumstances, including that the applicant had said, “This is wrong”, while he
    was sexually assaulting the complainant, to be believable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant also argues that one of the Crown
    witnesses contradicted the complainant’s evidence concerning whether she
    appeared to have injuries or look dishevelled after the May 2018 encounter, but
    that the trial judge failed to treat this as a direct contradiction. Again, I
    would not consider that a strong argument. The trial judge found that witness
    not to be reliable, noting his recollection for detail was lacking. Although
    the applicant complains that the trial judge speculated that the lack of
    ability to recall was due to the passage of time, in my view, this argument
    still faces the same significant obstacle that confronts those directed at a
    trial judge’s factual findings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant also argues that a Crown witness
    who testified about the August incident said she did not see any violence, and
    this contradicted the complainant and justified an acquittal on this charge.
    The trial judge, however, accepted the complainant’s evidence that the
    applicant headbutted her, rejected that of the applicant, and noted that “[s]imply
    because [the witness] may not have seen this does not mean it didn’t happen”; the
    trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it did happen.
    Although the applicant argues that this was not a proper application of <em>R.
    v. W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, I am not satisfied that is a strong
    argument.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>The Final Balancing</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the essential factors here are that
    the applicant has been convicted of serious crimes of domestic violence; he has
    other convictions and committed an offence of domestic violence while awaiting
    trial on these charges; he has been identified as having a high risk of
    re-offending in the area of domestic violence; he has a history of
    non-compliance with probation orders and terms of release; and the grounds of
    appeal, while not frivolous, do not clearly surpass that standard.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When considered from the standpoint of public
    confidence in the administration of justice viewed through the eyes of a
    reasonable member of the public, the enforceability interest in this matter
    outweighs the reviewability interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant has not established that his

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>CONCLUSION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the application is dismissed. Upon
    perfection of the appeal, the applicant may apply for an expedited hearing date.</span></p>
