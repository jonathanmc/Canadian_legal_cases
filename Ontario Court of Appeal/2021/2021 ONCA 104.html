  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>I.        OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal arises out of secondary market
    misrepresentations allegedly made by Barrick Gold Corporation during the
    construction of Pascua-Lama, a multi-billion-dollar gold mining project in the high
    Andes of Chile and Argentina. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants  the proposed representative
    plaintiffs in a putative securities class action  appeal the order of the
    motion judge, granting them leave to proceed under s. 138.3 of the Ontario<em> Securities Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5 (OSA) with one proposed
    misrepresentation claim against Barrick and the individual respondents, but
    denying them leave to proceed with all other claims they proposed to assert
    under Part XXIII.1 of the OSA. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under s. 138.3(1) of the OSA, a person or
    company who acquires or disposes of securities during the period between the
    time when a document containing a misrepresentation is released and the time
    when the misrepresentation is publicly corrected has a right of action for
    damages against the responsible issuer, each director of the responsible issuer
    at the time the document was released, and each officer of the responsible
    issuer who authorized, permitted or acquiesced in the release of the document,
    among others. However, pursuant to s. 138.8(1) of the OSA, an action may not be
    commenced without leave of the court, which must be satisfied that the action
    is being brought in good faith and that there is a reasonable possibility that
    the action will be resolved at trial in favour of the plaintiff. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge denied leave to proceed with
    most of the alleged misrepresentations because, even if they were
    misrepresentations, they were not publicly corrected. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The primary issues on appeal are whether the
    motion judge erred in principle (i) by effectively assuming the falsity of most
    of the alleged misrepresentations and determining whether leave to proceed
    should be granted by focusing on whether the misrepresentations had been
    publicly corrected or (ii) by taking an impermissibly narrow approach to
    determining whether the alleged misrepresentations were publicly corrected. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A secondary issue is whether this court should
    interfere with his conclusion that four alleged environmental
    misrepresentations by omission were not even arguably misrepresentations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the following reasons, I would allow the
    appeal in part and return the issue of whether leave should be granted in
    respect of the categories of alleged misrepresentations  described below as
    the capital expense (or, capex) and scheduling misrepresentations, and the accounting
    and financial reporting misrepresentations  to the court below. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>II.       BACKGROUND </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In brief, Pascua-Lama, straddling the border of
    Chile and Argentina at the headwaters of the Estrecho river system, was a
    complex and environmentally sensitive project. The motion judge described the
    Estrecho as a life force for the thousands of people, including indigenous
    communities, that lived downstream from the mining site. Barrick began work on
    the project in October 2009. The estimated cost of the project escalated, and
    environmental issues arose. In October 2013, Barrick concluded that the project
    was no longer financially viable and decided to shut it down. Barrick recorded
    a write-off of around $5 billion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Over the proposed two-year class period, there
    were five negative disclosures of information that resulted in significant
    declines in Barricks share price. In total, shareholders lost billions of
    dollars. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The list of alleged misrepresentations and
    public corrections appended to the motion judges reasons is similarly appended
    to these reasons. The alleged misrepresentations were made in annual financial
    statements, interim financial statements, managements discussion and analysis,
    or in an annual information form (AIF). Some of the alleged
    misrepresentations are alleged untrue statements of material fact. Others are
    alleged misrepresentations by omission; that is, alleged omissions to state a
    material fact that was required to be stated or that was necessary to make a
    statement not misleading in the light of the circumstances in which it was
    made.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The subject matter of these alleged
    misrepresentations, set out in full in the Appendix, essentially falls into
    three categories.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, misrepresentations by omission relating
    to when Barrick expected initial gold production to commence at Pascua-Lama and
    to the estimated capital expense budget for Pascua-Lama. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Between October 27, 2011 and October 31, 2013,
    the date for first gold production moved from mid-2013, to mid-2014, and then
    to the second half of 2014. In the same period, Barrick increased its estimated
    capex budget for Pascua-Lama from $5.0 billion to $8.0 billion to $8.5 billion.
    Barrick argued that each of these changes reflected unanticipated increases in
    construction costs, including skyrocketing labour and commodity prices in the
    aftermath of an earthquake, unexpected currency fluctuations,
    government-imposed tariffs, and falling gold and silver prices. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants allege that Barrick knew that its
    scheduling and capex estimates were unreliable and misleading. The appellants
    argue that each of the statements Barrick issued about its scheduled date for
    initial gold production and its estimated capex budget omitted to state a
    material fact that was either required to be stated or that was necessary to
    make a statement not misleading in the light of the circumstances in which it
    was made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellants allege that Barrick made
    a series of misrepresentations relating to environmental compliance at the
    Pascua-Lama project. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge granted the appellants leave to
    proceed with what he described as their core environmental claim, namely that
    on July 26, 2012 the respondents misrepresented that Barrick had completed the
    comprehensive water management system, required by the Resolución de
    Calificación Ambiental 024/2006 (the RCA), the primary Chilean environmental
    permit, and was therefore able to commence the mining activity described as
    pre-stripping. The appellants allege that this was an untrue statement of a
    material fact. The motion judges grant of leave to proceed with this core
    environmental claim is not at issue on this appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>What is at issue are four alleged
    misrepresentations by omission with respect to environmental compliance set out
    in the Appendix and discussed later in these reasons. The motion judge denied
    leave in respect of those alleged misrepresentations on the basis that there
    was no reasonable possibility of success. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the appellants allege that Barrick made misrepresentations
    by omission relating to accounting and financial reporting. Essentially, the
    appellants claim that Barricks internal controls were ineffective, it should
    have written the project down more than a year before it did, and that it
    failed to record contingent liabilities. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The materials on the leave motion were
    voluminous. The total body of evidence exceeds 50,000 pages of materials. The
    motion was argued over seven days. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>III.      THE MOTION JUDGES REASONS ON
    PUBLIC CORRECTIONS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 138.3(1) of the OSA provides that: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Where a responsible issuer or a person or
    company with actual, implied or apparent authority to act on behalf of a
    responsible issuer releases a document that contains a misrepresentation, a
    person or company who acquires or disposes of the issuers security during the
    period between the time when the document was released <span class=Underline>and
    the time when the misrepresentation contained in the document was publicly
    corrected</span> has, without regard to whether the person or company relied on
    the misrepresentation, a right of action for damages against [the issuer and
    various related parties]. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge explained that the public
    correction serves as a time-post for the purposes of the proposed class period
    and any eventual damages calculation. He indicated that it is also a
    constituent element of the secondary market misrepresentation cause of action:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In the absence of a discrete and identifiable
    public correction (whether provided by the defendant company or a third party)
    there is no basis for a s. 138.3 misrepresentation action  the absence of a
    public correction is dispositive and there is no need to proceed further and
    consider whether leave should be granted under s. 138.8. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The interpretation of public correction under s.
    138.3(1) has not received significant consideration at this court. However, a
    body of jurisprudence has developed in the courts below. The trial judge cited
    his prior decisions, and the decisions of other class action judges in the
    Toronto region, at para. 17 of his reasons.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> He summarized the criteria for a proper public correction as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There must be some linkage or connection between
    the alleged misrepresentation and the alleged public correction; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The public correction must share the same
    subject matter and, in some way, relate back to the misrepresentation; and,</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The public correction must be reasonably capable
    of revealing to the market the existence of an untrue statement of material
    fact or an omission to state a material fact. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Expanding on the third criterion, he wrote:</span></p>

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>IV.     AN OVERVIEW OF THE ISSUES REGARDING
    PUBLIC CORRECTIONS RAISED ON APPEAL </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants make two main arguments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, they argue that the motion judge erred in
    principle by determining the public correction issue without first examining
    all the evidence and determining whether there was a reasonable possibility
    that Barrick made a misrepresentation. They say that only after ascertaining
    the nature, subject matter and falsity of the alleged misrepresentation can the
    court appreciate and analyze the extent to which a pleaded public correction
    relates to and corrects the misrepresented facts. They argue that the
    motion judges failure to engage in this process tainted his analysis of
    whether there was a public correction. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, while they do not take issue with the
    three criteria for a public correction summarized by the motion judge, they
    argue the motion judge erred in principle (i) by applying a narrow, purely
    textual, analysis of the alleged public corrections and (ii) by failing to
    consider evidence, including expert economic evidence, about the context in
    which the alleged public corrections were made and how the alleged public
    corrections would be understood in the secondary market. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In response to the first argument, Barrick
    advises that it did not suggest to the motion judge that he determine the leave
    motion based on whether the requirement for a public correction was met. It
    fully argued the issue of whether there was reasonable possibility that the
    appellants claim that it had made misrepresentations could succeed and
    candidly admits that it would have preferred that the motion judge decide the
    issue. However, it submits that that the motion judge was entitled to
    effectively assume that the alleged misrepresentations had been made out and
    proceed as he did.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As to the appellants second argument, Barrick
    submits that the motion judge, having heard seven days of argument, was fully
    alive to the context in which the alleged public corrections were made and to
    the appellants expert evidence. For example, at the beginning of his reasons, he
    referred to the fact that, during the proposed class period, five negative
    disclosures resulted in significant declines in the share price. This, Barrick
    says, was in the report of the appellants expert, Cynthia Jones. Barrick
    argues that the motion judge did not refer to the appellants experts evidence
    because it was not probative of whether there was a public correction. Rather,
    the motion judge properly considered the criteria for a proper public
    correction. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Barrick characterizes the appellants as seeking
    to interfere with a determination of mixed fact and law to which deference is
    owed. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>V.      ANALYSIS OF THE ASSUMED MISREPRESENTATIONS
    ISSUE</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I reject the appellants argument that a motion
    judge cannot assume that the alleged misrepresentations are made out and deny
    leave to proceed under s. 138.3 of the OSA on the basis there is no reasonable
    possibility that a trial court would find there has been a public correction of
    those misrepresentations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As Barrick argues, in several different contexts
    and different areas of the law, the court has assumed that one constituent
    element of a cause of action or legal test has been satisfied and disposed of
    the case on the basis that a different constituent element has not been
    established. For example, in the context of a claim in unjust enrichment,
    courts have assumed that there has been enrichment and determined the case on
    the issue of whether there is an absence of juristic reason for the enrichment: <em>Bank of Montreal v. i Trade Finance Inc.</em>, 2009 ONCA 615, 96 O.R. (3d)
    561 at para. 36, affd on other grounds, 2011 SCC 26, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 360. Whether
    or not a public correction is properly characterized as an element of the
    statutory cause of action of secondary market misrepresentation, as I discuss
    below, it is a necessary part of the statutory scheme. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I note that the motion judge in this case is not
    the only motion judge to have accepted that this approach is available. In <em>Drywall
    Acoustic Lathing and Insulation, Local 675 Pension Fund (Trustees of) v. SNC-Lavalin
    Group Inc</em>, 2016 ONSC 5784 (<em>SNC-Lavalin</em>), at para. 48, Perell J.
    accepted, albeit in the context of a summary judgment motion, that it is
    possible to assume the falsity of the alleged misrepresentations for the
    purpose of determining whether a corrective disclosure or public correction
    exists.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants offer no authority for their
    position. Contrary to their assertion, <em>Mask v. Silvercorp Metals Inc.</em>,
    2015 ONSC 5348, affd 2016 ONCA 641 does not stand for the proposition that
    justices deciding motions for leave to proceed under s. 138.8 of the OSA are
    required to determine whether the plaintiff has a reasonable possibility of
    establishing that impugned disclosures were misrepresentations, and only then
    consider whether the plaintiff also has a reasonable possibility of
    demonstrating the alleged misrepresentations were publicly corrected. <em>Mask</em>  a decision of the motion judge in this case  simply sets out the pleading
    requirements applicable to claims brought under s. 138.3(1) of the OSA. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants also rely on <em>Theratechnologies
    Inc. v. 121851 Canada Inc.</em>, 2015 SCC 18, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 106 and <em>Rahimi
    v. SouthGobi Resources Ltd.</em>, 2017 ONCA 719, 137 O.R. (3d) 241, leave to
    appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 443. As the appellants note, in <em>Theratechnologies</em>,
    at para 38, Abella J., for the Supreme Court, wrote that the leave requirement
    is more than a speed bump and that, at the leave stage, the court must
    undertake a reasoned consideration of the evidence to ensure that the action
    has some merit. This, as Hourigan J.A. wrote for this court in <em>SouthGobi</em>,
    must include some weighing of the evidence that both parties are required to
    proffer under ss. 138.8(2) and (3) [i.e. affidavit evidence setting forth the
    material facts on which the parties intend to rely] and scrutiny of the entire
    body of evidence, not just the evidence of the plaintiff viewed in isolation.
    Further, given the fact that at the leave stage full production has not been
    made, the motion judge must be cognizant of the fact that the defendant may
    have relevant evidence that has not been produced or tendered: <em>SouthGobi</em>,
    at para. 48. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Through this reasoned consideration of the
    evidence, a motion judge discharges the competing duties of protecting issuers
    from unmeritorious claims and frivolous strike suits and ensuring that the
    secondary market remedy is not rendered illusory through the elimination of
    potentially meritorious claims: <em>SouthGobi</em>, at para. 45. However, in my
    view, read in context, <em>Theratechnolgies</em> and <em>SouthGobi</em> do not
    prevent a motion judge from taking a plaintiffs case at its highest by
    assuming the falsity of the impugned misrepresentation, and denying leave to
    advance that misrepresentation claim on the basis that there is no reasonable
    possibility that a trial court would find that there has been a public
    correction of the misrepresentation. In a proper case, a motion judge could
    discharge the competing duties in this manner. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>But it is an approach that should be used rarely.
    The existence of a misrepresentation is at the heart of the statutory cause of
    action. When an issuers disclosures are impugned, both the issuer and the
    shareholders have an interest in a finding that restores confidence in the issuers
    ongoing disclosure. Assuming a misrepresentation  that is, assuming a wrong 
    and then finding a second wrong  a failure to correct the misrepresentation  would
    generally do little to restore market confidence.  As I discuss below, it is
    also an approach that should be used with great caution. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>VI.     ANALYSIS OF THE APPROACH TO
    DETERMINING WHETHER THERE WAS A PUBLIC CORRECTION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This leads to the appellants second argument on

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As I will explain, assuming the falsity of the alleged
    misrepresentation does not relieve a motion judge of the obligation to engage
    in a reasoned consideration of evidence of the context in which the alleged
    public correction was made and how the alleged public correction would be
    understood in the secondary market if the alleged public correction does not,
    on its face, reveal the existence of the alleged misrepresentation.</span></a><span
lang=EN-CA> </span><span lang=EN-CA>In some cases, that may require the motion
    judge to consider evidence which also goes to the issue of whether there is a
    reasonable possibility that a trial court will find that there was a
    misrepresentation. Thus, caution is required. In some cases, assuming the
    falsity of the alleged misrepresentations  an approach driven by concerns of
    judicial economy  may prove a false economy. Judicial economy likely only outweighs
    the interests of an issuer and its shareholders in a finding as to whether
    there is a reasonable possibility that the trial court would find a
    misrepresentation and the risks entailed in assuming a misrepresentation when:
    the motion judge is faced with an overwhelming record; and the motion judge is
    confident that there is no material overlap between the evidence relevant to
    whether there is a misrepresentation, and the evidence of the context in which
    the alleged public correction was made and how the alleged public correction
    would be understood in the secondary market. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, where the motion judge must engage in
    an analysis of the evidence of context, it cannot be said (as the motion judge
    did in this case) that there is no possibility that the matter could be
    improved by further and better evidence at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>SNC-Lavalin</em>, Perell J. correctly
    rejected a purely semantic and mechanical approach to the determination of a
    public correction (referred to, here, as a corrective disclosure). He reasoned,
    at para. 45:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he determination of whether a corrective
    disclosure is corrective depends not only on a semantic analysis of what the
    public correction means but also on an analysis of how the words would be
    understood in an efficient market and also a statistical analysis of the effect
    of those words on the markets evaluation of the value of the securities that
    had been misrepresented to the marketplace. Put somewhat differently, a
    semantic analysis of whether a corrective disclosure was made is necessary, but
    it is not sufficient to determine the existence or non-existence of a
    corrective disclosure. What is required is an analysis of the literal meaning
    of the words, which is in any event not a purely mechanical exercise but one
    that involves, evidence, opinion, and argument, and also an analysis of the
    perceived or effective meaning of the words in the secondary market, which once
    again is not a mechanical exercise, but rather one that involves evidence. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Perell J. wrote this in reasons concluding that
    whether there had been a public correction could not be determined on a summary

    not, on its face, clearly reveal the existence of the alleged
    misrepresentation, the judge must engage in a reasoned consideration of
    evidence of the context in which the alleged public corrections were made and
    how the alleged public corrections would be understood in the secondary market
     applies equally on a leave motion. </span></p>

    driven by his view that the public correction is an additional safeguard

    legislative history of the statutory scheme does not support his view that the
    public correction serves as an additional safeguard. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First and foremost, the Committee appears to
    have viewed a public correction simply as part of the statutory scheme  a necessary
    time-post for the proposed class period and any eventual damages calculation. The
    public correction delimits who may bring a claim for secondary market
    misrepresentation and makes damage calculations for secondary market claims
    standardized and predictable.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

    have assumed the misrepresentation would be corrected or that the necessary
    disclosure would be made. If the Committee intended to limit the proposed
    statutes applicability only to those misrepresentations later explicitly
    corrected, it is surprising that it did not so indicate in its otherwise
    extensively canvassed report. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the Committee did not list a public
    corrections requirement among the safeguards against open[ing] the floodgates
    to U.S. type securities litigation: Allen Report, at para. 6.72; see also
    paras. 4.18-4.20. The Committee considered sufficient the significant
    differences in class action procedures, the limitations on liability recommended
    (including the limited class of plaintiff, several liability, and monetary
    limits on liability); and other differences between US and Canadian legal
    culture and courts (including the comparative rarity of civil jury trials and
    the loser pays rule).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to the safeguards against unmeritorious
    litigation considered or proposed by the Allen Committee, the CSA Committee proposed
    requirements for leave to proceed and court approval of settlements. The regime
    subsequently enacted by Ontario as Part XXIII.1 of the OSA  and other Canadian
    provinces securities acts  closely followed the CSAs proposal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Not treating the public correction as an <span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, recall that, at the leave stage, a
    consideration of whether there has been a public correction of a
    misrepresentation follows a finding that there is a reasonable possibility that
    it will be found at trial that the defendant has released a document or made a
    public oral statement containing a misrepresentation (or, in rare cases, the
    making of an assumption that there was a misrepresentation). When that
    threshold has been cleared (or the misrepresentation assumed), the plaintiffs
    claim is potentially meritorious. Where there is a reasonable possibility of a
    misrepresentation, the plaintiffs claim can hardly be characterized as a
    strike suit. Furthermore, the clearing of the misrepresentation threshold,
    combined with the fact that the plaintiff brought an action, suggests that
    there was a public correction. The plaintiff must have learned of the
    misrepresentation somewhere.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the supposed public policy rationale identified
    at para. 21 of the motion judges reasons  that, in the absence of a strict
    public correction requirement, the cause of any decline in the market value of
    the security may be properly attributed to factors other than the correction of
    the alleged misrepresentation  is anticipated and addressed elsewhere in Part
    XXIII.1. Section 138.5(3) provides that assessed damages shall not include any
    amount that the defendant proves is attributable to a change in the market
    price of securities that is unrelated to the misrepresentation or the failure
    to make timely disclosure. The motion judge properly averted to the role of s.
    138.5(3) in his discussion of the core environmental misrepresentation claim
    for which he granted leave. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    was necessary to make the statement at issue not misleading in light of the
    circumstances in which it was made. </span></p>

    public correction does not, on its face, reveal the existence of the alleged
    misrepresentation, the motion judge must engage in a reasoned consideration of
    evidence concerning the context in which the alleged public corrections were
    made and how the alleged public corrections would be understood in the
    secondary market. </span></a><a name="_Hlk63327187"><span lang=EN-CA>The

    respect to the allegations of environmental misrepresentations. He granted the
    appellants leave to proceed with their core environmental claim. However, as
    indicated above, the motion judge concluded that leave to proceed with the four
    alleged environmental misrepresentations by omission should not be granted. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first three alleged environmental
    misrepresentations suffered from fatal chronology issues. In short, he
    concluded that the material facts that the appellants allege should have been
    disclosed to make the three representations at issue not misleading arose after
    the representations were made. Since they arose after the representations were
    made, Barrick could not have been required to state them at the time it made
    the representations. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I will explain, I would not interfere with

lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In their 50-page factum, the appellants
    concentrated solely on the motion judges approach to determining whether the

    by omission could not arguably constitute misrepresentations. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In its responding factum, Barrick noted that the
    appellants did not take issue with the motion judges conclusion that the
    alleged environmental misrepresentations by omission could not arguably

    supported by the evidence and was open to him. </span></p>

    errors they alleged that the motion judge had made, the appellants did not
    refer to his having erred in concluding that the alleged environmental

    They again focused on the public corrections issue. However, in response to
    questions from the panel, the appellants indicated that they take issue with
    the motion judges findings with respect to the alleged environmental
    representations by omission. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In their Notice of Appeal, the appellants refer
    to only two of the four alleged environmental misrepresentations for which the
    motion judge denied leave: those made November 1, 2012 and March 28, 2013. With
    respect to those two alleged misrepresentations, the appellants state at para.
    10(b) of their Notice of Appeal that the motion judge failed to properly
    consider the applicable principles to determine the existence of
    misrepresentation by omission. Their other articulated grounds of appeal in
    relation to those alleged misrepresentations relate to the public correction
    issue. </span></p>

    argue that the motion judge erred in concluding that the alleged environmental
    misrepresentations by omission could not arguably constitute
    misrepresentations. Barrick submits that it would be unfair to permit the
    appellants to challenge those findings at this juncture. Among other reasons,
    Barrick has not had the opportunity to respond to what the appellants now argue
    are errors. In any event, Barrick argues, the motion judges findings are not
    tainted by reversible legal error or palpable and overriding errors of fact. </span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>Some additional context</span></p>

    what he characterized as the key points of evidence relating to those alleged
    misrepresentations. Some additional background, drawn from that summary, will
    help understand his reasons for denying leave to proceed with the four alleged
    environmental misrepresentations by omission and the parties arguments. </span></p>

    headwaters of the Estrecho river system, was environmentally sensitive. In the
    motion judges words, [i]t was imperative that toxic by-products of the mining
    process, such as acid rain drainage, did not contaminate that river system. To
    this end, Chilean authorities required that Barrick construct a comprehensive
    water management system (WMS) as part of the RCA. </span></p>

    mountain water, using a system of horizontal channels and natural ravines, and carried
    that water around Pascua-Lamas waste dump and onward to the river system. The
    RCA required that the WMS be capable of receiving water flows equivalent to a
    1000-year flood. If the terrain carrying descending mountain water was not
    carved in rock, the RCA required that terrain to be lined with an appropriate material
    to prevent erosion and mudslides. </span></p>

    water hit the loose rock, soil and silt present at the outlet work that

    with the primary environmental agency, referred to as the SMA in the motion
    judges reasons, admitting that it had breached the RCA by not building the
    outlet work at the opening of Q-9 according to the RCAs specifications. The
    SMA rejected the self-report because it was incomplete and conducted its own
    investigation. It laid environmental charges against Barrick. In its charging
    document, released in March 2013, the SMA accused Barrick of 23 environmental
    violations. In a letter to the SMA in April 2013, Barrick acknowledged and
    accepted 13 of the 14 violations relating to the WMS. The SMA fined Barrick
    $16 million, which was reduced to $12 million for early payment. </span></p>

  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Barrick had decided to follow a highly risky strategy of commencing

lang=EN-CA>He concluded that the alleged omissions are precluded by obvious
    chronology problems:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The alleged omissions that pertain to the two
    March 28, 2012 representations relate to a pre-stripping event that actually
    took place several weeks later in May 2012. Therefore, there is zero chance that
    any of these alleged omissions (in a March disclosure about an event that did
    not occur until May) can even arguably be described as omissions that should
    have been disclosed to make the [March] representations not misleading.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I agree with Barrick that there is no basis to interfere with this
    conclusion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, to the extent that the appellants Notice of Appeal could be
    argued as having opened the door to the appellants making arguments that the
    motion judge erred in concluding that some of the alleged environmental
    misrepresentations by omission did not arguably constitute misrepresentations,
    the Notice of Appeal makes no reference to these alleged environmental
    misrepresentations by omission. The appellants at no point sought leave to rely
    on an error in concluding that the alleged March 28, 2012 misrepresentations
    did not arguably constitute misrepresentations as a ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second, and in any event, I reject the appellants argument that
    there is no chronology problem because, effectively, an issuer is deemed to
    make the impugned representation anew when related material facts requiring
    disclosure subsequently arise. This is contrary to s. 1(1) of the OSA, which
    defines a misrepresentation by omission as an omission to state a material
    fact that is required to be stated or that is necessary to make a statement not
    misleading <span class=Underline>in the light of the circumstances in which it
    was made</span> (emphasis added). The definition is clear. The circumstances
    in which it was made do not include circumstances which arose after the
    statement was made. The appellants framed their claim as one based solely on
    misrepresentation. Their argument confounds liability for failure to make
    timely disclosure under s. 138.3(4) of the OSA with liability for
    misrepresentation under ss. 138.3(1) and (2) of the OSA. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Finally, while alleged omission 1  and possibly 2, 5, 6 and 7 
    might appear to relate to Barricks alleged intention <span class=Underline>prior</span> to the May 2012 pre-stripping event to act in violation of environmental law by
    commencing pre-stripping in breach of the RCA, knowing of the risks of doing
    so, Barrick points to evidence that the decision to begin pre-stripping was not
    made until the day before pre-stripping began and the appellants do not point
    to any evidence to the contrary. </span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>The November 1, 2012 and March 28, 2013 misrepresentations

    financial statements for the third quarter of 2012 and of March 28, 2013 in
    Barricks 2012 AIF, set out in the Appendix and below. They report on the two

    Projects Chilean environmental approval. The Court declined to issue an

    misleading:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Barrick had commenced pre-stripping in violation of the RCA prior to
    the completion of the WMS;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The self-report had been rejected for failing to provide specific,
    truthful and demonstrable information on January 31, 2013 after an SMA
    investigation uncovered other serious RCA violations beyond those admitted by
    Barrick; and,</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Barrick had committed 13 of 14 of the RCA violations alleged by the
    SMA, which it admitted to on April 29, 2013.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>With respect to the November 1, 2012 statement, he concluded, again,
    that there were chronology issues:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The alleged omissions that deal with a
    supposed violation of the RCA, Barricks self-report about the WMS, the SMAs
    rejection of the self-report, and Barricks April 29, 2013 letter of
    acceptance all post-date the November 1, 2012 statement and would not have
    been known to Barrick at that time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The alleged March 28, 2013 misrepresentation by omission failed for
    a different reason: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The alleged omissions that pre-date the March
    28, 2013 AIF such as the self-report and its rejection by the SMA are not
    omissions that should have been disclosed to make the March 28, 2013 update
    about the constitutional rights litigation not misleading. There was nothing
    in this latter update that even arguably required information about the
    self-report or its rejection to make the constitutional rights update (that
    referred only to pre-stripping and not the WMS in any event) not misleading. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In their written submissions, the appellants argue that Barricks
    statements on November 1, 2012 and March 28, 2013, in which it claimed that it
    would vigorously defend these actions, could only be interpreted by the
    market as a denial of the allegations in the constitutional litigation that it
    had violated the RCA, which Barrick, in fact, knew to be true. In addressing
    the motion judges conclusion with respect to the November 1, 2012 statement,
    they say that the motion judge misapprehended the substance of the pleaded
    omissions, which was that in May 2012 Barrick violated the RCA  including by
    carrying out pre-stripping activities prior to full completion of the WMS, as
    alleged in the constitutional litigation  and knew it had violated the RCA,
    not that Barrick admitted to those violations a year later. This
    misapprehension, they argue, resulted because the motion judge failed to
    consider their omission claims through the lens of all the relevant evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I reject the appellants argument that the motion judge failed to
    consider their allegations of environmental compliance misrepresentation by
    omission in the context of the relevant evidence. It is apparent from his
    reasons (including the portion of his reasons granting the appellants leave to
    proceed with their core environmental claim) that he carefully considered the
    significant body of evidence relevant to the alleged environmental
    misrepresentations, including Barricks belief about the completion of the WMS
    and the right to start pre-stripping. The appellants point to no evidence that
    Barrick did not, in fact, intend to vigorously defend the constitutional
    litigation. The impugned statements were made in documents which, elsewhere,
    cautioned that the outcome of the constitutional litigation was uncertain and
    that if Barrick were unable to resolve these disputes favourably, it may have a
    material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations. The
    argument that the appellants now advance about the real substance of the
    alleged omissions is inconsistent with their having plead alleged omissions 2
    and 3 with respect to both the November 12, 2012 and March 28, 2013. </span></p>

    correction of a misrepresentation cannot constitute a public correction for
    the purposes of the statutory scheme. That issue was not argued on appeal and I
    should not be taken as endorsing his view. It remains an issue for another day.</p>
