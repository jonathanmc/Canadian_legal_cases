  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted by a jury on three
    counts of sexual assault against his wife, C.Q., and one count each of sexual
    assault and sexual interference against his daughter, C.L. The offences were
    alleged to have occurred in the City of Toronto between December 29, 2009 and
    December 19, 2014.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals his convictions on the
    ground that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of the appellant’s
    alleged prior sexual and physical abuse of the complainants. The appellant
    submits that the volume and extent of this evidence had significant prejudicial
    effect on the jury, particularly, but not exclusively, by way of reasoning
    prejudice. He asserts that the trial judge failed to properly weigh the
    prejudicial effect of the evidence against its probative value. Had that
    balancing occurred, he argues that the trial judge would not have admitted the
    evidence, or would have curtailed the evidence and given the jury a more
    appropriate instruction about its permitted and prohibited uses.</span></p>

    in China in 1995. They have two daughters: C.L., born in July 1995, and L.L.,
    born in October 2001.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both C.Q. and C.L. claim that the appellant
    abused them, physically and sexually, before and after the family moved to
    Canada. Some of their allegations of sexual abuse in Canada formed the basis of
    the indictment. However, most of the evidence of uncharged prior discreditable
    conduct related to events that occurred in China. I will describe the acts
    referred to in the indictment before I turn to (1) the Crown’s application to
    admit the evidence of uncharged prior discreditable conduct, and (2) the
    evidence that was eventually admitted pursuant to the trial judge’s ruling.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Allegations of C.Q.</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.Q. alleged that the appellant regularly forced
    intercourse upon her during their marriage. Most of these acts occurred when
    C.Q. was menstruating and had made it known to the appellant that she did not
    wish to have intercourse. Allegations relating to such acts in Canada after
    2009 formed count three, a global count of sexual assault.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The other two counts of sexual assault in
    relation to C.Q. concerned discrete incidents. The first was the subject of
    count four and occurred in the spring of 2011. C.Q. alleged that she was two
    months pregnant and asleep in bed when the appellant initiated intercourse. She
    asked him to stop because she was in pain. The appellant was not deterred and
    concluded the act some minutes later. The next morning, C.Q. felt pain in her
    abdomen and noticed that she was bleeding. She called an ambulance and was
    taken to Toronto East General Hospital, where doctors told her that she had
    suffered a miscarriage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second incident was the subject of count
    five and occurred in early 2014. C.Q. was in bed when the appellant lay on top
    of her and initiated intercourse. C.Q. was menstruating and asked the appellant
    to stop because she was in pain. The appellant ignored her pleas. As C.Q.
    continued to resist, the appellant held her hands above her head. The appellant
    eventually finished and fell asleep. The following morning, C.Q. found blood in
    her urine. She experienced abdominal pain for one month afterwards.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.Q. did not report these assaults to police.
    However, in December 2014, when she was visiting C.L. at the Centre for
    Addiction and Mental Health (“CAMH”) in Toronto, she read a leaflet about sexual
    assault and learned that non-consensual sex is illegal in Canada. This
    convinced her to report the abuse to police.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Allegations of C.L.</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.L. alleged that the appellant regularly
    sexually assaulted her after the family moved to Toronto in December 2009. This
    conduct was the subject of counts one and two.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to C.L., at nighttime, the appellant
    frequently came into the bedroom she shared with her sister. He read to L.L.
    until she fell asleep, and then moved to C.L.’s bed and lay on top of her. The
    appellant kissed C.L. “vigorously” as he rubbed his body up and down hers.
    Although there was a blanket separating them, C.L. said that she could feel his
    penis between her thighs. C.L. sometimes called for her mother, but the
    appellant got off her before her mother arrived.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2010, C.L. called 911 to report the
    appellant’s abusive behaviour. She recanted her allegations when the police
    arrived because her mother had expressed fear that the family would be
    deported.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The assaults ended when C.L. was approximately
    16 or 17 years old. C.L. asked the appellant what a future husband would think
    about his abuse of her. The appellant warned C.L. that if she told anyone about

lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s application to admit the evidence of
    uncharged prior discreditable conduct hinged on three grounds. First, the Crown
    argued the evidence was necessary to establish “<em>animus</em>,” specifically
    “a pattern of control [and] a pattern of possessiveness … to do the very acts
    that [the appellant] is alleged to have done.” Second, the Crown argued that
    the evidence would help contextualize the reason why C.Q. stayed in a
    relationship with the appellant. Finally, the Crown asserted that the evidence
    would explain why the complainants did not report the abuse to police. The
    Crown stated that the point of the evidence was to avoid “an antiseptic record”
    that left the jury without a “real sense” of the parties’ relationship.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel objected to the application,
    claiming that the Crown had not given formal notice of its intention to adduce
    this evidence. He also argued that the evidence was highly prejudicial to the
    appellant and that he had no opportunity to properly challenge the
    complainants’ allegations. Defence counsel asserted that the appellant denied
    both the counts in the indictment and the evidence of prior discreditable
    conduct.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In brief oral reasons, the trial judge granted
    the Crown’s application. The trial judge found that defence counsel had been
    aware of the Crown’s intention to adduce the evidence since the pre-trial
    conference. With respect to the actual content of the evidence, he observed
    that there was an “overwhelming body of case law” permitting the introduction
    of such evidence to flesh out the narrative, to show <em>animus</em>, and,
    depending on how the evidence unfolded, to explain why the complainant spouse
    may have stayed in the marriage and delayed her reporting the abuse. The trial
    judge mentioned that, depending on the issues raised by the defence, he might
    be required to instruct the jury about the limited use of some aspects of the
    evidence.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge subsequently gave written
    reasons for his ruling on the application and for his ruling on the Crown’s

lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He began by reviewing the complainants’
    allegations in relation to both the uncharged prior discreditable conduct and
    the counts on the indictment. He noted that the Crown sought admission of the
    former to explain: (a) the nature of the relationship, and the appellant’s <em>animus</em> in relation to the complainants; (b) the complainants’ fear of the appellant,
    specifically to explain why they had not previously reported their allegations;
    and (c) the reason why C.Q. had remained in the marital relationship.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge referred to <em>R. v. Handy</em>,
    2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, as the leading case on the admission of
    similar act evidence. He recognized that the Crown bore the onus of
    establishing, on the balance of probabilities, that the probative value of the
    evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. In particular, the evidence must
    show more than a general propensity to commit the offence and must be of
    significance to a live issue in the charges before the court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After identifying some of the factors to be
    considered when assessing the probative value of the evidence, the trial judge
    observed, at para. 51:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>These factors must be evaluated through the
    lens of prejudice. A court must consider whether the issue to be proven by the
    evidence can be established by evidence of a lesser prejudicial nature. In
    addition, the court must be mindful of the risk that the evidence becomes a
    distraction drawing focus away from the actual offence and consuming a
    disproportionate amount of time (&quot;reasoning prejudice&quot;).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge appreciated that this was not a
    case in which the similar act evidence was tendered to establish the identity
    of the offender. The question for the jury was whether the appellant had
    committed the <em>actus reus</em> of the offence. In a case such as this, the
    Supreme Court pointed out that “the drivers of cogency in relation to the
    desired inferences” will not be the same as they are in a case where the
    identity of the accused is in issue: <em>Handy</em>, at para. 78. The trial
    judge also referred to the observations of Watt J.A. in <em>R. v. J.M.</em>,
    2010 ONCA 117, 251 C.C.C. (3d) 325, at para. 91:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Where the evidence of similar acts is summoned
    in support of proof of the <em>actus reus</em>, it is not an invariable
    requirement that there be a strong peculiarity or unusual distinctiveness
    underlying the events being compared: <em>Handy</em>, at para. 81. The cogency
    of evidence of similar acts may arise from the repetitive and predictable
    nature of an accused’s conduct in closely defined circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then reviewed several of this
    court’s decisions in domestic violence cases, stating that the admission of
    uncharged prior discreditable conduct “has long been seen as a valuable tool in
    assessing the nature of the relationship between an accused and the complainant
    as well as providing a clearer picture of the context in which the allegations
    took place. It is on this basis that it often derives strong probative value”:
    see <em>R. v. Batte</em> (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.); <em>R. v. F. (D.S.)</em> (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 609 (C.A.); <em>R. v. R. (B.S.)</em> (2006), 81 O.R. (3d)
    641 (C.A.). The trial judge cited this court’s decision in <em>R. (B.S.)</em>,
    at para. 38, to explain that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence was admissible to explain the
    nature and dynamic of the relationship between the appellant and [the
    complainant], to demonstrate the appellant's animus toward [the complainant],
    to assist in explaining [the complainant]’s delay in fully disclosing the
    assaultive acts of her husband, and to rebut the appellant's claim of
    fabrication by [the complainant]. Moreover, unlike the facts in <em>Handy</em>,
    the evidence in this case was provided by [the complainant] herself, and not by
    a third party.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge concluded that the evidence the
    Crown sought to adduce was an essential part of the narrative of events, and
    that without the evidence, the jury would be left with an incomplete and
    misleading account of the relationship between the appellant and the
    complainants. The jury might speculate on why the abuse only began in Canada.
    The trial judge noted the observation of Hill J. in <em>R. v. S.B.</em>, [1996]
    O.J. No. 1187 (Gen. Div.), at para. 31, that denying the jury this evidence
    “runs the risk of presenting an entirely sterile and antiseptic record devoid
    of the realities of the individual circumstances of the participants.” The
    evidence was highly relevant, and while it was undoubtedly prejudicial, the
    prejudice was significantly outweighed by the probative value. The trial judge
    said that he would give a limiting instruction to the jury, informing them of
    the proper use of the evidence.</span></p>

    a “particularly violent sexual assault while C.Q. was menstruating” in February
    2014, which required medical attention.</span></p>

    dad. He went to bed the night before and slept until two or three in the
    afternoon the next day. [C.L.] went to wake him. I don’t know how he hit … my

    examination-in-chief, the trial judge called the morning break. Once the jury
    had left the court room, the trial judge expressed concern to the Crown about
    the manner in which the evidence had come out, “because the whole point of
    allowing this evidence in is to show the relationship between the two of them.
    And I’m concerned about this idea that we’ll be hearing evidence that he’s
    brutally beating his daughter, she’s covered in blood.” He reminded the Crown
    that the purpose of the evidence was to show the parties’ relationship, “not to
    have [the appellant’s] acts somehow in front of the jury.” He said to the
    Crown, “[y]ou painted this danger of showing that he’s this brutal assaulter,
    which I don’t think is, was the purpose of my ruling.”</span></p>

    returned, and the trial judge gave them a brief mid-trial instruction. He
    pointed out that the evidence heard to that stage of the trial related to
    events that had occurred before the counts on the indictment. He told them that
    the object of the evidence was to show them the nature of the relationship
    between the appellant and C.Q., and the state of their marriage prior to
    December 2009. He instructed that,</span></p>

    her on the ear:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When [C.L.] was around two or three years old,

    both my hands and forced my hands to the back. And he was stronger than me. He

    the children. In 2008 when I went back to China to visit my family, I saw that

    grabbed [C.L.’s] hair, my older daughter’s hair, and smashed her on the floor.

    that had occurred in Canada and were the subject of the indictment. The Crown
    asked C.Q. to listen carefully to her question and to only answer what was
    asked. The Crown observed that C.Q. had identified an incident in China when
    the appellant forced intercourse upon her while she was menstruating, and asked
    whether something similar had happened in Canada. C.Q. replied affirmatively, and
    the Crown asked her to describe the assault in further detail. C.Q. proceeded
    to give an unresponsive answer that related to count four. C.Q. described an
    event in 2011, when she was two months pregnant, and the appellant forced
    intercourse on her. She told him it hurt and asked him to stop, but he was
    undeterred. The next day, C.Q. felt a pain in her abdomen and noticed that she
    was “bleeding a little.” She called an ambulance and was taken to the hospital
    where she was told by doctors that she had suffered a miscarriage.</span></p>

    this response and asked C.Q. whether the appellant had ever forced intercourse
    on her in Canada while she was menstruating. C.Q. replied by stating that the
    appellant had told her that if he did not have sex regularly, he would “feel
    hurt” and “have [a] prostate infection or something like that.” He was “really
    intimidating.” C.Q. recounted that the appellant would assault her when she was
    menstruating, every month.</span></p>

    about an assault by the appellant in early 2014 (apparently, count five). C.Q.
    recalled that the appellant had been watching something on his computer,
    “something weird maybe”, when she went to bed. At some point, in the middle of
    the night, the appellant got on top of her. C.Q. asked the appellant to get off
    and informed him that she was having her period. The appellant did not stop.
    The next day, C.Q. had blood in her urine, “not period blood,” and abdominal
    pain.</span></p>

    incident of the 911 call in 2010. C.Q. recounted that C.L. called her to say
    that the appellant had assaulted her, and that C.L. had called police. C.Q.
    immediately spoke to a friend who told her not to engage with the police because
    they were new immigrants, and her family could be sent back to China.</span></p>

    information to C.L. After the police left the family home, C.Q. remembered that
    C.L. disclosed the appellant’s abuse to her. When C.Q. confronted the
    appellant, he became angry, smashed his computer mouse, and told C.Q. to “take
    [C.L.] to the hospital to check if she is still a virgin.”</span></p>

    appellant lying in the bed with C.L. on one occasion. C.Q. had heard C.L.
    yelling about the appellant being in her bed and went to see what was happening
    in her daughters’ bedroom. C.Q told the appellant to leave the bedroom and said
    that because the children were growing up, he had to be careful with his
    behaviour. C.Q. testified that the appellant threw a “temper tantrum.” He
    responded that “he would beat [C.L.] until she is handicapped … until she is
    mentally retarded.”</span></p>

    explanation of how she came to speak to police about her allegations against
    the appellant. According to C.Q., the appellant was ordered by the Children’s
    Aid Society to leave the family home in December 2014. Around the same time,
    C.Q. learned that her daughter, C.L., had become a patient at CAMH. C.Q.
    visited C.L. at the CAMH facility in Toronto and read a leaflet that explained
    that non-consensual sex was illegal in Canada. C.Q. testified that she
    ultimately reported her abuse to police in January 2015.</span></p>

    was relatively brief. C.Q. was a difficult witness, and she was not directly
    challenged in relation to her evidence concerning the appellant’s uncharged
    prior discreditable conduct or the counts contained in the indictment. Defence
    counsel suggested that C.Q. and C.L. had conspired to convict the appellant so
    that he would be put in jail and would not be able to access the proceeds of a
    house sale in China. He also suggested that C.Q. would not have left the
    children with the appellant if the appellant was really the abusive and violent
    person she had described. Defence counsel put to C.Q. that she had relatives in
    China who were police officers, presumably to imply that she could have
    reported the appellant’s conduct to police if it had actually occurred. In
    addition, defence counsel drew the jury’s attention to C.Q.’s pre-existing
    medical conditions to provide an explanation for her symptoms and doctors’
    visits after the alleged assaults.</span></p>

    referred to in the Crown’s application or the trial judge’s ruling, saying that
    the appellant punished her when she got low marks at school. C.L. recalled that
    on one occasion, the appellant had woken her up during the night and made her
    sit on her knees until morning.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown prompted C.L. to speak about her
    relationship with the appellant after her mother had left for Canada. C.L. said
    that when she reached puberty around the age of 12, she “learned nasty things
    from him that I wish I could have not.” C.L. described a particular incident in
    China that she “remember[ed] really well.” The appellant had asked her to sleep
    in the bed that he shared with her sister, L.L. After L.L. fell asleep, the
    appellant moved on top of C.L. claiming to look at the clock on the wall. C.L.
    said that she could feel his penis between her thighs.</span></p>

    assaults had occurred on multiple occasions. She said that one night, she
    panicked and threatened to tell her teacher about what the appellant was doing.
    The appellant replied that her teachers would not believe her and would think
    she was dirty. C.L. stated that “in the Chinese culture it’s, like, the victims
    are always blamed.”</span></p>

    took place in China while her mother was in Canada. The first occurred in the
    kitchen of their family home. The appellant kissed C.L. on the mouth and
    touched her “all over the place”, and she suddenly realized that her underpants
    were halfway down her thighs. The defence objected at this point to the
    evidence on the basis that it was detailed rather than “general.” The trial
    judge did not give effect to the objection, stating that the evidence simply
    showed how the assaults started happening before the family immigrated to
    Canada, and, as a result, was admissible pursuant to his ruling.</span></p>

    in China. According to C.L., the appellant came into the bathroom when she was
    taking a shower and began to wash her back. He proceeded to hug her from
    behind, and she saw his penis coming out from his briefs.</span></p>

    about the abuse in China because she was afraid how she would be perceived. In
    addition, C.L. started to receive an allowance after the appellant touched her
    inappropriately, and she was unsure whether “everybody goes through [it] or is
    it just me?” C.L. recalled that she wanted to protect her sister and simply did
    not have the mental energy to fight with the appellant.</span></p>

    her hair and hitting her head on the bed or the wall.</span></p>

    incident in Canada. C.L. recounted that the appellant had overheard her
    conversation with L.L. The appellant came into the bathroom where the sisters
    were, and pinched C.L.’s arm, “squeezing all of the blood out of my vein.” C.L.
    called 911, but she recanted her allegations because C.Q. was afraid that they
    would get deported.</span></p>

    continued to enter the bedroom she shared with her sister and get into her bed.
    When L.L. was asleep, the appellant would lie on top of her, kiss her, and move
    up and down on her body so that she could feel his penis. C.L. said that this
    occurred approximately once a week.</span></p>

    his wife and daughter. He stated that he was fearful of his wife, C.Q., because
    she came from a “powerful family” in China. He also claimed that his daughter
    hated him because he was strict, would not permit her to date, and disciplined
    her to make sure she did well at school. He mentioned that he was not entirely
    certain about why C.Q. and C.L. had made up the allegations against him, but he

    jury that the complainants’ allegations, both the uncharged prior discreditable
    conduct and the substantive offences, “never happened.” C.L. had fabricated a
    story to explain her bad grades, to hurt her father, and to establish her worth
    in the family. Defence counsel posited that C.Q. had made up her own stories of
    abuse to make C.L.’s evidence more believable. C.Q. wanted to have the
    appellant put in jail so that she could have sole access to the proceeds of the
    sale of a house that the couple owned in China.</span></p>

    an additional instruction regarding the limited use of the evidence of
    uncharged prior discreditable conduct. He explained that the evidence of events
    before the appellant’s move to Canada in 2009 had been adduced for a limited
    purpose:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The purpose is: (1) to allow you to understand
    the nature of and the state of the family relationship prior to the sexual

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Y]ou cannot use the evidence of that conduct
    to conclude or help you conclude that the offences with which [the appellant]

    because of that character or disposition. In other words, you cannot rely on

lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant concedes that the evidence in
    question had probative value in relation to three issues: (1) <em>animus</em>;
    (2) the complainants’ failure to report their allegations; and (3) C.Q.’s
    decision to remain in the marital relationship. He submits, however, that the
    trial judge erred in law by focusing almost exclusively on the probative value
    of the evidence of uncharged prior discreditable conduct, failing to consider
    the potential for prejudice, particularly reasoning prejudice, and failing to
    balance that prejudice against the probative value of the evidence.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant contends that in assessing the
    prejudicial effect of the evidence, the trial judge should have considered the
    volume and extent of the evidence and its impact on the jury. The evidence
    consumed approximately one-third to one-half of both complainants’
    evidence-in-chief. In addition, the allegations were unproven and spanned an
    eight-year period in China. The nature and the volume of the evidence, taken
    together with the unstructured manner in which it was presented at trial, could
    have distracted the jury’s attention from the offences with which the appellant
    was charged. The evidence could have also “inflamed their passions”, with the
    result that the appellant was tried, not on the counts in the indictment, but
    on his uncharged prior discreditable conduct. The appellant asserts that the
    trial judge’s limiting instruction was insufficient to deal with reasoning
    prejudice. He argues that his right to a fair trial was impaired, and a new
    trial is now required.</span></p>

    error in his analysis of the probative value and the prejudicial effect of the
    evidence. According to the Crown, the trial judge articulated the correct test
    and turned his mind to the possibility that both types of prejudice might arise.
    He ultimately determined that the probative value of the evidence outweighed
    its prejudicial effect. The Crown reminds us that the trial judge’s decision is
    owed substantial deference.</span></p>

    evidence was adduced at trial did not distract the jury. The trial was
    relatively brief, the evidence came from the complainants rather than from a
    third party, and the uncharged conduct was no more heinous than the offences
    with which the appellant was charged. The Crown points out that the trial judge
    intervened in the examinations of witnesses as needed and provided two limiting
    instructions to the jury, one mid-trial and the other in his final
    instructions. In the Crown’s submission, the trial judge took all the necessary
    steps to ensure that the appellant’s rights were not infringed. The Crown
    requests that the appeal be dismissed.</span></p>

    judge is a request by the Crown to introduce evidence of an accused’s uncharged
    prior discreditable conduct – sometimes called “extrinsic” discreditable
    conduct evidence, because it is extrinsic to the conduct on which the
    indictment is based. In a judge-alone trial, experience and training enables
    the judge to appreciate the purposes for which such evidence is proffered, and
    to self-instruct on its limited use(s). A jury obviously does not have the
    benefit of that training and experience to assist them in discriminating
    between permitted and prohibited logical thought processes when judging the
    conduct of an accused. The jury can all too readily use the evidence for an
    improper purpose. For example, the jury may conclude that the accused is a bad
    person who did bad things and ought to be punished, whether or not they
    committed the offences with which they are charged. And, as will be described
    below, there is a risk that evidence of uncharged allegations will confuse the
    jury and cause them to lose track of what the trial is all about – whether the
    prosecution has proven each of the counts on the indictment beyond a reasonable
    doubt.</span></p>

    care to ensure that such evidence goes before the jury only after a
    determination that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. If the
    evidence is admitted, the jury must be instructed, in an appropriate and timely
    way, about the proper and improper use(s) of the evidence. In order to make
    that distinction, the jury must be clearly informed of the purpose for which
    specific pieces of evidence may be used.</span></p>

    well-known dangers must be kept front and centre in a case-specific analysis,
    balancing the probative value and the prejudicial effect of the evidence. This
    analysis requires a close look at the evidence the Crown proposes to admit, the
    issues to which it will be directed, and the manner in which it will be
    presented.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the trial judge acknowledged the <span

    prejudice, and found that the evidence was undoubtedly prejudicial, he did not
    actually consider the nature and extent of the reasoning prejudice that could
    arise, or balance that prejudice against the probative value of the evidence.
    Returning to the factors identified earlier in the assessment of the
    prejudicial effect of the evidence of uncharged prior discreditable conduct, we
    see that: (a) the evidence was highly discreditable, and included the alleged
    sexual assault of C.Q. when she was recovering from childbirth, a physical
    assault of C.L. as a young child, and multiple sexual assaults of both C.Q. and
    C.L. in China; (b) the evidence gave rise to significant moral prejudice, and a
    risk that the jury would infer the appellant’s guilt based on bad character;
    (c) the evidence introduced the real risk of reasoning prejudice by confusing
    the jury about which acts the appellant was being tried for; and (d) the
    evidence limited the appellant’s ability to respond, because the events
    occurred many years earlier in China, and any attempt to challenge the
    complainants’ allegations would likely have simply emphasized them in the
    jury’s eyes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A proper consideration of the evidence and its
    potential prejudicial effect should have led the trial judge to consider
    whether there were ways in which to mitigate its impact while preserving its
    probative value. It might have persuaded him to give a more timely and
    effective mid-trial instruction that prepared the jury for the reception of the
    evidence, explained how the evidence should be used, and cautioned them against
    its misuse.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the trial progressed, however, the prejudice
    was amplified by the manner in which the Crown presented the evidence – priming
    the jury with a dramatic opening statement, and front-end loading the trial
    with C.Q.’s lengthy and graphic recitation of various sexual and physical
    assaults allegedly perpetrated by the appellant in China, distinct in time from
    the offences with which the appellant was charged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the submission of appellant’s
    counsel that the volume and extent of this evidence was significant. Much of it
    went well beyond the parameters contemplated by the Crown’s application and the
    trial judge’s ruling. Moreover, the mid-trial instruction (which occurred after
    some of the most prejudicial evidence had been admitted) did not provide the
    jury with an adequate framework in which to understand the permitted use of
    this evidence, and to protect against its improper use. Neither the mid-trial
    instruction nor the trial judge’s final instruction identified the serious risk
    of reasoning prejudice in this case, or explained to the jury how it could be
    avoided.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    assess and balance the prejudicial effect of this evidence was an error of law.
    It allowed the probative value to overwhelm his analysis, and led to a body of
    highly prejudicial evidence being admitted at trial, unfiltered and
    uncontrolled. The prejudice was significant, in part due to the Crown’s failure
    to lay an appropriate foundation for the jury’s reception of the evidence, and
    in part due to the manner in which the evidence unfolded at trial. There is a
    real risk that the jury convicted the appellant for his uncharged prior

    evidence is presumptively inadmissible, and its introduction is exceptional. It
    must be confined to cases in which the evidence is necessary, and where its
    probative value exceeds its prejudicial effect, having regard to both moral
    prejudice and reasoning prejudice. Vague terms, such as “narrative”, “context,”
    and “background,” cannot be permitted to serve as a substitute for a careful
    assessment of how the evidence will assist the jury in understanding other
    admissible evidence, what inferences the jury may properly draw from the

    reference to a record in the Crown’s factum in the court below, no reference to
    it in the parties’ submissions on the <em>voir dire</em>, and no reference to

    marital relationship. In response to the Crown’s application, defence counsel
    stated that he was not intending to cross-examine the complainants on why they
    had not reported the abuse earlier or why C.Q. had remained in the marital
    relationship. This commitment, had it been pursued, might have undermined a
    substantial part of the prosecution’s rationale for the admission of the

    both complainants’ explanations came up naturally and did not require reference
    to the prior abuse. C.Q. only discovered that non-consensual marital sex was
    illegal in Canada when she read a brochure at CAMH, which led to her reporting
    the abuse. And C.L. did not disclose the abuse because she was afraid that
    others would believe she was “dirty” and because of her mother’s fear they
    would be deported. An appropriate focus on eliminating or reducing prejudice
    might have foreseen this line of questioning and obviated the need for much of

    appropriate caution against inappropriate reasoning. For example, the trial

    final instructions to explain to the jury how they are to use, and how they are
    not to use, the evidence. It is not clear to me what the jury was expected to
    take from the instruction that the purpose of the evidence was to allow them to
    understand the nature and state of the family relationship prior to the
    allegations at issue, and to demonstrate the appellant’s “<em>animus</em> or
    dislike” of the complainants. If the evidence is being introduced as
    “narrative” – that is, as evidence that was not relevant and material in its
    own right, but to assist the jury in understanding admissible evidence – then
    it is incumbent on the trial judge to clearly instruct the jury on exactly how
    the evidence is to be used.</span></p>
