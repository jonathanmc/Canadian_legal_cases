    explicit material. The appellant and M.D. called each other pet names, had engaged
    in oral sex, and the appellant had sent the complainant sexually explicit

    prospects as mitigating. Specifically, it is submitted that the sentencing
    judge erred by considering the fact that the appellant had not engaged in
    counselling without also considering the practical availability of counselling.
    The appellant had been arrested in January 2018 and was held in pre-trial
    custody. There was no basis to believe he could receive counselling in
    provincial pre-trial facilities. He was released on very restrictive bail conditions
    in March 2018, which provided little, if any, opportunity to engage in
    counselling. The appellant argues that the sentencing judge effectively held it
    against him that he had not engaged in counselling, while not appreciating how
    difficult it was for him to actually obtain counselling. In doing so, the
    sentencing judge erred in law.</span></p>

    to consider the appellant’s rehabilitative prospects. When considering the
    evidence before the court in its totality, it was open to the judge to conclude
    that the appellant’s risk of re-offending was not so low that it comprised a
    separate mitigating factor. The judge’s treatment of this factor as neither
    mitigating nor aggravating was within his discretion and is owed deference on
    appeal. Furthermore, the appellant’s sentence is fit when measured against the
    gravity of the offence and moral culpability of the offender. </span></p>

    submits that the sentencing judge did not disregard Dr. Gojer’s expert opinion.
    Rather, he acknowledged Dr.&nbsp;Gojer’s finding that the risk of reoffending
    was in the low range. The sentencing judge declined to characterize the
    appellant’s risk level as mitigating because Dr.&nbsp;Gojer was careful to
    predicate his finding of low risk on the appellant’s participation in
    counselling. As of the date of the sentencing hearing, the appellant had not
    engaged in counselling or treatment. The respondent submits that this was not
    in error. The evidence indicated that there was some risk to re-offend, but
    again the risk would be lowered if the appellant made a strong commitment to
    his rehabilitation.</span></p>

    counselling under the appellant’s bail conditions. A finding that counselling
    was unavailable would have required speculation. There was no evidence about
    the availability of treatment while the appellant was on bail, either before or
    after the house arrest condition was considerably loosened to permit the
    appellant to pursue employment opportunities. Further, the respondent points
    out that defence counsel did not raise this issue in submissions at the
    hearing, despite affirming that the appellant had not yet engaged in treatment. </span></p>

    had not obtained counselling at the time of sentencing does not appear to have
    been of any overriding importance to the sentencing judge. It was only one
    consideration and related to the risk posed by the appellant. Moreover, the
