  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> The appellant appeals his convictions and
    sentence, following a judge alone trial on charges of sexual assault, assault,
    criminal harassment, and uttering threats to kill an animal. He was sentenced
    to a global term of five years and 11 months incarceration, less five months
    credit for pre-sentence custody. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 7, 2014, the complainant, then 21,
    accompanied the appellant, then 51, from Ottawa to a cottage near Bancroft. Both
    the complainant and appellant testified at trial and each gave differing
    versions of the events that transpired on the night in question. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified the appellant took her
    to the cottage under the false pretense she would be attending a family party. Instead,
    she found herself alone with the appellant, not knowing where she was, and with
    no way of leaving.</span><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
200%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif'> </span><span lang=EN-CA>That night,
    after becoming angry with her for resisting his sexual advances and after
    threatening to kill her dog, the appellant forced her to engage in sexual
    activity. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant gave a different version. He testified
    that he had a long-standing sexual relationship with the complainant and that,
    on the night in question, she had gone to the cottage with him willingly, and that
    they engaged in consensual sexual activity. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The following morning, the appellant and the
    complainant were involved in a car accident, resulting in the car going off the
    road and rolling into a ditch. The complainant, who was injured, crawled out of
    the sunroof, and asked residents of a nearby house to call 911. She was
    subsequently taken by paramedics to a hospital.  On two separate occasions,
    when asked if she was sexually assaulted, she denied she was sexually
    assaulted.  She was first asked by the paramedic who took her to the hospital,
    and then while at the hospital, she was asked by a nurse.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also left the scene.  He was
    located at a nearby gas station and arrested by the police, at which time he
    denied there was anybody else in the car with him. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;Upon returning to Ottawa, the appellant
    attempted to contact the complainant multiple times. He attended at her
    residence several times, once entering her apartment with keys she left at the
    cottage. He slipped disturbing notes under her door. The complainant
    subsequently contacted the police who advised her that they could take no
    action against the appellant unless she applied for a peace bond.  The complainant
    then applied for a peace bond, at which time, she disclosed the allegations of sexual
    assault for the first time.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>Discussion</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant
    submits that the trial judge failed to properly apply the </span></span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>W.(D)</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA> principle,
    reversed the burden of proof, and applied uneven scrutiny to the evidence. We
    do not accept these arguments. </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge
    set out his understanding of the principles of </span></span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. W.(D.)</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>,
    [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, in detail before beginning his analysis of the evidence,
    and structured his analysis accordingly. For example, he explained, at para.
    20, that he would deal with the appellant’s evidence first though he heard it
    last because he “would be bound to acquit [the appellant] if [he] found that
    evidence either completely compelling or at least sufficient to raise a
    reasonable doubt.” </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>The trial
    judge’s reasons when read as a whole demonstrate his understanding that the
    trial was not simply a credibility contest between the complainant and the
    appellant. In assessing the appellant’s evidence in light of all the evidence
    at trial, it was proper for the trial judge to compare the evidence of the
    appellant to the evidence of the complainant. </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>We are not
    persuaded that the trial judge applied an uneven scrutiny to the evidence of
    the appellant and of the complainant or otherwise erred in his assessment of
    the complainant’s credibility. The trial judge found the complainant’s 
    evidence about non-essential matters, such as when the relationship started and
    when the complainant had veterinary appointments, had discrepancies that “may
    give rise to concern about the accuracy of the unaided recollection of the
    complainant”. He found her forthright in acknowledging those discrepancies and concluded
    the discrepancies did not “undermine the important points in her evidence.” After
    carefully considering the defects in the complainant’s credibility and
    reliability, he was entitled to accept, as he did, her explanations for her
    initial denials she had been sexually assaulted and her testimony that the
    sexual activity at the cottage was not consensual.  A trial judge can accept
    some, none, or all of a witness’ evidence.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>By contrast, the
    appellant’s evidence was replete with many unexplained contradictions and
    inconsistencies. The number of times he claims to have had sex with the
    complainant ranged from less than 10 to between 66 and 107 times. He refused to
    admit and could not explain the discrepancy in his evidence on this point. He repeatedly
    claimed to have left the complainant’s cell phone in her apartment after the
    collision, and when confronted with cell phone records that placed the phone
    with him, he claimed there was a “well orchestrated plot” to frame him. The
    appellant did not point to any matter that made it clear the trial judge
    actually applied different standards of scrutiny in assessing the evidence of
    the appellant and complainant: see </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v.
    Radcliffe</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>, 2017 ONCA
    176, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 3, at paras. 23-25.  </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R.
    v. Kiss</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>, 2018 ONCA 184,
    on which the appellant relies, was an entirely different case. Here, the trial
    judge considered and accepted the complainant’s explanations for the
    discrepancies in her evidence while the appellant offered none. He did not, as
    the appellant argues, simply disregard the inconsistencies in the complainant’s
    evidence because she acknowledged them. On the other hand, the trial judge considered
    possible explanations for the discrepancies in the appellant’s evidence, such
    as confusion about dates, but found them inadequate. Unlike in <i>Kiss</i>, the
    trial judge did not “[expect] more of [the appellant] than he did of [the
    complainant].”: <i>Kiss</i>, at para. 96. </span></span></p>
