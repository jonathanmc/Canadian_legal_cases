  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondents, Floriano Daponte and Vivian
    Hamilton, were charged with several drug offences, possession of proceeds of
    crime and possession of a prohibited weapon (a “flick knife”). The trial judge
    found that their right to a trial within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Canadian Charter of
    Rights and Freedoms</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> had been infringed and stayed
    the proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge, relying on the framework set
    out by the Supreme Court of Canada in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>R. v. Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2016 SCC
    27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, held that the net delay was 30.5 months, which
    exceeded the presumptive ceiling of 30 months and was presumptively unreasonable.
    He held that the Crown did not rebut the presumption that the delay was
    unreasonable because it had not established the presence of exceptional
    circumstances or that the case was particularly complex. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown appeals on the basis that the trial
    judge erred in his application of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> framework. It
    argues that the trial judge erred in finding that a </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>certiorari</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> application brought by the respondents after they were committed for trial was
    not an exceptional circumstance. The delay caused by this proceeding (3 months)
    should have been subtracted from the net delay, resulting in remaining delay of
    27.5 months. Since the remaining delay fell below the presumptive ceiling, the
    onus was on the respondents to show that the delay was unreasonable. According
    to the Crown, the respondents have not established that this is one of the
    clear cases where a stay should be granted. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would allow the appeal. The trial judge erred
    in finding that the respondents’ </span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:
200%'>certiorari</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> application was not an exceptional
    circumstance. This court has previously held that when the defence brings a </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>certiorari</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> application in good faith, that proceeding is an exceptional circumstance
    because the decision to bring the application would be outside the control of
    the Crown, unless in opposing such an application the Crown is acting in bad
    faith, taking a frivolous position, or responding in a dilatory manner.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the trial judge improperly focused
    on the fact that the Crown took a frivolous position with respect to just one
    aspect of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>certiorari</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> application in order to find that the entire application was not an
    exceptional circumstance. While the respondents were partially successful on
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>certiorari</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> application because the prohibited weapon count was quashed, it is
    apparent that the trial judge lost sight of the fact that the balance of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>certiorari</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> application was dismissed. The committals for trial on the drug charges and the
    proceeds charge were upheld. The Crown did not act unreasonably in opposing the
    application and the proceeding should have been considered an exceptional
    circumstance. The time allocated for that proceeding (3 months) should have
    been deducted from the net delay, leaving remaining delay of 27.5 months that
    did not breach the presumptive ceiling. This case is also not one of the clear
    cases where a stay should be granted notwithstanding that the delay falls below
    the presumptive ceiling. </span></p>

    three days, the respondents were committed on a total of nine charges on
    November 17, 2017. The case was then adjourned to December 12, 2017 in the
    Superior Court of Justice. In the meantime, the respondents challenged the
    committals for trial by serving a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:

    ruling, the trial was scheduled for ten days starting on March 4, 2019 with
    pre-trial motions scheduled for December 10 and 11, 2018. The pre-trial motions
    filed by the respondents claimed that the police had violated their s. 8 </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Charter</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> rights
    against unreasonable search and seizure.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In response to the motion, the Crown made
    further disclosure to the respondents on December 3, 2018. That disclosure
    consisted of unredacted portions of the search warrant that was issued in this
    case. The Crown had previously withheld portions of the warrant based on
    changing levels of perceived harm to informants and based on the privacy
    interests of other individuals. Upon receipt of this disclosure, the
    respondents filed an additional pre-trial motion alleging a breach of s. 7 of
    the <em>Charter</em> and seeking the remedy of excluding this new disclosure.
    Both parties agreed that the s. 7 application logically had to precede the
    hearing of the s. 8 application since the relief sought by the respondents
    included the exclusion of evidence required for the s. 8 application. Both
    parties also agreed that four days instead of two were now required to argue
    the motions. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a result of these developments, the motions
    did not proceed on December 10, 2018 as originally scheduled. The parties met
    with the local administrative judge and the trial coordinator to reschedule the
    motions. However, there were no available dates to hear the motions until the
    originally scheduled trial date commencing March 4, 2019. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ultimately, the original trial dates scheduled
    for March were now scheduled as dates for the pre-trial motions and the trial
    dates were rescheduled to start on June 4, 2019. On May 13, 2019, the
    respondents filed the s. 11(b) application. The trial judge heard the
    application and granted a stay of proceedings on June 6, 2019. </span></p>

    of drugs and proceeds of crime. There is no suggestion in this case that the
    Crown acted in bad faith, took a frivolous position or responded in a dilatory
    manner in relation to the drug and proceeds charges. Indeed, the </span><span

    one single paragraph is devoted to the issue of the flick knife. Respectfully,
    the trial judge erred by concluding that the respondents’ application was not
    an exceptional circumstance because of the Crown’s conduct in relation to just
    one count, notwithstanding its appropriate conduct and successful defence in
    relation to all the other counts.</span></p>

    for ruling) is subtracted from the net delay, the remaining delay would be 27.5

    they desired for the case to move forward. His findings do not disclose
    palpable and overriding error and support the respondents’ submission that they
    took meaningful steps that demonstrated a sustained effort to expedite

lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, as noted above, the respondents must
    also meet a second pre-condition for obtaining a stay of proceedings in cases
    of delay falling under the 30-month ceiling. That pre-condition requires the
    respondents to show that the case markedly exceeded the reasonable time
    requirements of the case, which is a question of fact: </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, at
    para. 91. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As set out in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, determining
    whether a case has taken markedly longer is not a matter of precise
    calculation. The reasonable time requirements to get a case to trial depend on
    a variety of factors, including the complexity of the case, whether the Crown
    took reasonable steps to expedite the proceedings and local conditions. I turn
    to the application of those factors. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I see no basis to interfere with the trial
    judge’s finding that this was not a complex case. Although the case was set for
    two weeks of trial, the trial judge noted that the Crown’s witnesses were
    police officers, the issues to be litigated at trial were relatively narrow and
    the proceedings were straightforward. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also agree with the trial judge’s observations
    that the Crown exclusively had the control, power and obligation to
    periodically revisit and reassess the withholding of disclosure involving
    confidential informants and to be sensitive to timeliness in relation to the
    defence and their rights to full answer and defence. I agree with the trial
    judge that this did not happen and that the late disclosure was as a result of
    a somewhat late response to the s. 8 application. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to local conditions, </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> instructs trial judges to employ knowledge of their own jurisdiction, including
    how long a case of that nature typically takes to get to trial in light of
    relevant local considerations and systemic circumstances. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The question then becomes whether the delay of
    27.5 months for a ten-day drug trial involving two accused is markedly longer
    than was reasonable for London, Ontario. While the trial judge and the local
    administrative judge made some comments about the shortage of judicial
    resources, including judicial vacancies, nothing on this record would establish
    how long a case of that nature typically takes to get to trial in light of the
    relevant local and systemic circumstances: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, at para. 89. I
    also note that the trial judge specifically found that the case progressed
    normally while it was in the Ontario Court of Justice; the 11 months and 15
    days before that court was not impacted by the judicial vacancies in the
    Superior Court of Justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondents highlight the trial judge’s
    comments that significant ongoing limited judicial resources impacted this case
    and played a role in the difficulties encountered. I acknowledge that the trial
    judge expressed his concern that the Superior Court in London was under-resourced
    and did not have the luxury to address late-breaking unforeseeable
    circumstances. However, the trial judge’s comments do not assist in this regard
    because, as noted above, he proceeded on the erroneous premise that the presumptive
    ceiling had been breached. He did not turn his mind to whether this trial took
    markedly longer than it should have even with the late-breaking developments of
    the case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the Supreme Court of Canada, in
    determining whether a trial took markedly longer than it should have, it is
    necessary to “step back from the minutiae and adopt a bird’s eye view of the
    case”: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at para. 91. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the trial judge, the parties agreed
    that up until December 7, 2018, the case was on track for the trial which was
    initially scheduled to proceed on March 4, 2019 for 10 days. The trial judge
    explained that it was only after this point that the “critical and problematic
    circumstances in this case then arose”. If the trial had proceeded as initially
    scheduled, the remaining delay would have totalled approximately 24.5 months.
    While the respondents had indicated availability for earlier trial dates, they
    accepted the dates in March, and no complaint was made that 24.5 months meant
    the case was taking markedly longer than it should have. Although the Crown’s
    late disclosure and respondents’ s. 7 </span><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>Charter</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> application
    served on December 7, 2018 led to a further delay of 3 months, the net delay of
    27.5 months remained well below the ceiling. Taking a bird’s eye view of the
    case, I have concluded that this is not one of the clear cases where a stay
    should be granted for delay. </span></p>
