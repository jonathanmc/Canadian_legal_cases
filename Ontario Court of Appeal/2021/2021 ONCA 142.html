  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The applicant, Kevin
    Lenihan, is the father of two-year old M. The respondent, Indira Shankar is the
    mother. They have been involved in high conflict custody litigation for M.’s entire
    short life. Ultimately, the trial judge awarded sole custody to Mr. Lenihan and
    the right for him to move to Oregon with M. Ms. Shankar appeals. Mr. Lenihan
    brought a motion for security for costs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>At the original return
    of the motion, Ms. Shankar indicated that she wanted to file a response, but
    the court office would not accept her material because it was not in the
    correct format. I adjourned the motion to be returned before me and advised the
    motions office to accept her material notwithstanding its deficiencies. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>I have now heard and
    read submissions from both parties. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>BACKGROUND </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Lenihan, an
    American citizen, lives in Oregon where he owns a home near to his parents and
    two brothers. He and Ms. Shankar met in Oregon. Very quickly after their
    meeting, Ms. Shankar moved into his home and they married in June 2017. Ms. Shankar
    is a citizen of India with permanent residence status in Canada. A month after
    their marriage she returned to Canada ostensibly to maintain her permanent
    residence status. The following month, the parties learned that Ms. Shankar was
    pregnant. Mr. Lenihan moved temporarily to Ontario to be with her. Problems in
    the marriage arose and they separated in December 2017. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>In early February 2018 Ms.
    Shankar sent Mr. Lenihan a series of text messages indicating that the baby had
    been born prematurely and was in the neo-natal intensive care unit, breathing
    on a ventilator. These statements were false. M. was born on March 30, 2018. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>M. was born with a
    condition called craniosynostosis. She underwent three corrective surgeries in
    2018 and 2019. The surgeries were successful, and she has no continuing
    disability, although updates will be required from time to time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>From the day of her
    birth, M. has been at the center of conflict and litigation. Due to allegations
    made by Ms. Shankar, the Children’s Aid Society (“CAS”) became involved. So too
    did the Office of the Children’s Lawyer (“OCL”). The CAS and OCL determined
    that the allegations were false. Several family court judges conducted case
    conferences. Finally, the custody trial began on November 17, 2020. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Lenihan and </span><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>his mother travelled from their home in Oregon
    to Ontario two weeks in advance of the trial to sit out their required
    quarantine period in a local hotel where they maintained their residence
    throughout the proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>THE TRIAL</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The trial lasted for
    four weeks.  The trial judge’s reasons describe its many challenges. </span><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>On the fifth day of trial, Ms. Shankar,
    alleging that Mr. Lenihan was not the biological father, filed the results of a
    paternity test. She then said he was just a sperm donor and filed a “Sperm
    Donor Agreement” which showed he did not want to be involved with the child.
    She also filed an email exchange between the father and his counsel which
    alleged the planning of a criminal act to remove the mother from the
    litigation. It became evident rather quickly that these documents were – in the
    words of the trial judge – “transparent and shocking forgeries created by the
    mother.” This was not the only forgery presented by Ms. Shankar. She also
    presented an 18-page affidavit from someone who – upon being called as a
    witness by Mr. Lenihan – said she did not know Ms. Shankar and had never signed
    the affidavit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>The mother’s two counsel –
    her tenth and eleventh – withdrew from the record upon realizing their
    unwitting participation in placing fraudulent evidence before the court. The
    trial judge granted Ms. Shankar’s request to continue the trial in-person. The
    day was a Friday. It concluded with witness planning, generous directions on
    self-representation and the sorting of details for that evening’s weekend
    transfer of M. to her father.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>Thirty hours later, Ms. Shankar
    boarded a plane for Delhi, India, first class, with a transfer from Delhi to
    Bengaluru. She did not inform the court, the father or the child. She did not
    return. Her agent counsel attended on the following Monday, seeking leave for
    the mother to continue with the trial on Zoom from her family home in India.
    The trial judge granted the request and ordered her to provide travel and other
    particulars, including a copy of her return ticket. A return ticket was never
    provided.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>The trial continued until
    December 11, 2020. Ms. Shankar never returned.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Due to the urgency of the
    situation, the trial judge gave oral reasons at the end of the trial, to be
    followed by more extensive written reasons. She said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Time is of the essence in this decision. There
    is a young child who has been living in a hotel for the past 20 days with a
    father who is a resident of Oregon, and a mother who has left the jurisdiction
    without a return ticket.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I find that it is
    in [M.’s] best interest to transfer her residence from Ontario, Canada to
    Oregon, USA where she will have a stable residence, extended family supports,
    medical care and a good education. In doing so, I acknowledge that this change
    in residence will remove this case from Ontario jurisdiction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge
    dispensed with the requirement of the mother’s consent for M. to travel.  She also
    dispensed with the need for the mother’s consent to issue a birth certificate,
    passport (both Canadian and American) and any other travel or identifying
    documents necessary for Mr. Lenihan’s return to Oregon with M. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>As she said she would,
    the trial judge then provided more detailed written reasons reported at 2021
    ONSC 330. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>FURTHER REASONS OF
    THE TRIAL JUDGE</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge’s
    further reasons examined the extensive evidence and her findings in more
    detail, all with a view to the child’s best interests. She </span><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>concluded that Ms. Shankar’s actions were entirely
    inconsistent with the child’s best interests. She had taken extreme steps to
    keep the father, the professionals, CAS and the OCL from knowing basic facts.
    She did not name the father on their daughter’s Statement of Live Birth or
    obtain a birth certificate. She asserted non-existent court Orders to
    professionals and the hospital and ignored Orders that did exist, particularly
    Orders for disclosure. She had a second child but did not disclose the father of
    her second child or his legal name to Mr. Lenihan, the Society, the OCL or the
    Court. She repeatedly threatened the father, his family and CAS workers. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge found that
    the mother had virtually no credibility because of her repeated lies and
    attempts at forgery. She was also, according to the trial judge, incapable of
    putting the child’s needs before her own. She went to extreme lengths to attack
    the father. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge found the
    father caring and competent, attuned to the child’s needs and genuinely willing
    to foster the mother-daughter relationship while being appropriately
    protective. Because of the allegations against him by the mother, he was
    extensively investigated by the Toronto and Peel CAS. He has been further
    vetted by a Children’s Lawyer. The OCL’s final Report detailed 18 substantive
    allegations that had been made by the mother against the father, all of which were
    determined to be false. The OCL found him to be a fully available and capable
    caregiver. His plan of care is sound and supported by his extended family. He
    offers the child a stable, healthy, and emotionally rich childhood. The trial
    judge said that he built a strong attachment with M. in the face of
    “unimaginable adversity”. She found that the father will meet the child’s
    medical, educational, and emotional needs. She had evidence from a pediatrician
    in Oregon who has agreed to continue the required follow-up for her care. The
    trial judge found that the father was “more than a capable parent”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>Against this background
    Mr. Lenihan moves for security for costs of Ms. Shankar’s appeal. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    appropriate to award security for costs in a child-related matter. This is a
    rare case. As the trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I say this
    gravely: but for cases of infanticide or abduction, Ms. Shankar’s actions in
    and outside of this litigation exceed any known to me in the caselaw.</span></p>

    credibility and factual findings that were strongly supported by the evidence
    and the mother’s conduct throughout the proceedings, which I have summarized
    above. In particular, the trial judge carefully considered the child’s best
    interests and found that they were best served by being with the father in
    Oregon. Because of the mother’s conduct towards the father and his family,
    there was no basis to award joint custody. </span></p>
