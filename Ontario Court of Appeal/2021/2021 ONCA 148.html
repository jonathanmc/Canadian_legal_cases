  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Benotto J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>The purpose of the <em>Pay Equity Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.7 (the “Act”), is to redress systemic gender discrimination
    in compensation experienced by those in female job classes. To that end, the
    Act requires employers who are subject to the Act to “<em>establish</em> and <em>maintain</em> compensation practices that provide for pay equity in every establishment of
    the employer” (emphasis added): Act, s. 7(1). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>In establishing pay equity, three different
    methods of comparison are used. Each involves a comparison between male and
    female job classes. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>In predominantly female workplaces, like the
    nursing homes in question, there are no male job classes with which female job
    classes can be directly compared. For women in these workplaces, the Act
    provides a “proxy” method whereby a female job class, from an establishment where
    pay equity has already been achieved using a male comparator, is deemed to be
    the male job class. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>The parties in this case dispute whether the
    proxy method is to be used in ensuring that pay equity is maintained. The
    appellants, the Participating Nursing Homes (“PNH”) and the Attorney General of
    Ontario (“AGO”), submit that the proxy method is only to be used to establish pay
    equity, not to maintain it. The respondents, the Ontario Nurses’ Association
    (“ONA”) and the Service Employees International Union, Local 1 (“SEIU”), disagree.
    They submit that the proxy method must also be used to maintain pay equity,
    because otherwise there would be no ongoing male comparator, which is essential
    to identify and redress systemic discrimination in compensation. In their
    cross-appeal, they submit that if the Act is not interpreted as requiring the
    proxy method to be used in maintaining pay equity, then the Act contravenes s.
    15 of the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>The matter came before the Pay Equity Hearings
    Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) following applications by the ONA and the SEIU. The
    Tribunal did not agree that the proxy method was to be used to maintain pay
    equity and set out a formula for maintaining pay equity that did not include
    the proxy method. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>The Divisional Court concluded that the Tribunal’s
    decision was unreasonable. It held that a proper interpretation of the Act
    requires ongoing access to male comparators – as set out in the proxy method – to
    maintain pay equity. The Divisional Court remitted the matter to the Tribunal
    to specify what procedures should be used to ensure continued access to male
    comparators. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>For the reasons that follow, I conclude that
    the Tribunal’s decision is unreasonable, as the text, context, scheme and
    purpose of the Act make it clear that ongoing access to male comparators through
    the proxy method is required to maintain pay equity. I would dismiss the appeals
    and the cross-appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>BACKGROUND</p>
  <p class=Heading>The parties</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>The PN<a name="_Hlk53218985">H </a>are a group
    of employers that operate up to 143 for-profit nursing homes in Ontario. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>The ONA is the bargaining agent for
    approximately 2,100 registered nurses and allied health professionals working
    at nursing homes across the province. The SEIU is the bargaining agent for
    registered practical nurses, personal support workers, health care aides, and
    dietary, housekeeping, and recreational aides working at the PNH. The SEIU and the
    ONA are referred to collectively as the Unions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>The AGO was added as an intervener by the Tribunal and also
    appeals.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>The Tribunal and the Equal Pay Coalition were added as
    interveners by the Divisional Court and have made submissions before this court
    as well.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Ontario’s pay equity legislation</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>The purpose of the <em>Pay Equity Act</em> is clear. The
    preamble provides that “it is desirable that affirmative action be taken to
    redress gender discrimination in the compensation of employees employed in
    female job classes in Ontario.” The body of the Act further confirms:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>4&nbsp;(1)
    The purpose of this Act is to redress systemic gender discrimination in
    compensation for work performed by employees in female job classes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>Section 1(1) of the Act specifies when a job class is a
    “female job class” and when it is a “male job class”. Generally speaking, a
    female job class is a job class in which 60 per cent or more of the members are
    female. Section 1(1) of the Act defines the term “job class” to mean “those
    positions in an establishment that have similar duties and responsibilities and
    require similar qualifications, are filled by similar recruiting procedures and
    have the same compensation schedule, salary grade or range of salary rates”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>The <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Act</span></em><em> </em>imposes an obligation to both establish and maintain pay-equity-compliant
    compensation practices: </span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>7&nbsp;(1)
    Every employer shall establish and maintain compensation practices that provide
    for pay equity in every establishment of the employer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'> </span><span style='color:black'>As explained
    in more detail below, systemic discrimination is identified by undertaking a
    comparison between female job classes and male, or deemed male, job classes in
    terms of compensation and the value of work performed: Act, ss. 4(2), 21.13. The
    criterion applied in determining the value of work is “a composite of the
    skill, effort and responsibility normally required in the performance of the
    work and the conditions under which it is normally performed”: Act, s. 5(1). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>The <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Act</span></em><em> </em>prescribes three methods for achieving pay equity: the job-to-job,
    proportional value and proxy methods. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>The job-to-job and proportional value methods involve
    comparing the value/compensation relationship of female job classes to the
    value/compensation relationship of male job classes within the employer’s
    establishment. An “establishment” means all of the employees of an employer
    employed in a geographic division or divisions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>The Act provides the proxy method for achieving pay equity
    in establishments without any male job classes. The proxy method is complex,
    but at its core, it involves comparing a female job class in the seeking
    employer’s establishment (in this case, the PNH) to a female job class at a
    proxy employer’s establishment (in this case, Municipal Homes for the Aged
    (“Municipal Homes”)). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>A proxy female job class is used because it has already
    achieved pay equity by way of comparison to a male job class within the proxy
    employer’s establishment. The value/compensation relationship of the proxy
    female job class is compared to the value/compensation relationship of the
    female job class at the seeking employer’s establishment with a view to
    determining the adjustments necessary to achieve pay equity for the seeking
    employer’s employees. In short, the proxy female class functions as the “deemed”
    male comparator. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>To achieve pay equity for <em>all</em> female job classes
    within the seeking establishment, the female job class that was compared to the
    proxy female job class becomes the “key female job class”. All other female job
    classes in the seeking establishment are then evaluated to ensure that the
    value/compensation relationship for their jobs is equal to that of the key
    female job class.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The parties disagree on how to maintain pay equity</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk56437841">[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>Employment in the nursing home sector is
    almost exclusively female. As a result, there are no male job classes available
    for purposes of comparison at the PNH, and they were required to use the proxy
    method in establishing pay-equity-compliant compensation practices for their
    employees. Municipal Homes were identified as a suitable proxy employer. They
    are similarly female dominated, but because they are operated by municipalities,
    there are male job classes available for comparison.</span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>In 1994, the PNH took steps to establish pay-equity-compliant
    compensation practices for female employees using the proxy method. Following
    extensive negotiations, the Unions and the PNH reached an agreement. In
    accordance with the agreement, pay equity was established for all female job
    classes at the PNH by 2005, following adjustments to increase compensation for
    all the female job classes. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>The Unions take the position that the PNH have failed to
    maintain pay-equity-compliant compensation practices since 2005. Over time, the
    Unions have observed several changes in PNH workplaces that suggest the value
    of the work performed by employees is increasing: a new legislative framework;
    new education requirements for employees; increasing acuity of nursing home
    residents; and more medical services required to meet the rising needs of

    workplace changes, increasing the value of their work. The Unions have also
    observed that wage gaps have re-emerged between PNH employees and employees at the

    the compensation of employees at the Municipal Homes had increased because of

style='color:black'>The Tribunal agreed that the Act imposed an obligation on
    the PNH to maintain pay-equity-compliant compensation practices, but rejected
    the submission that the proxy method should be used to fulfill that obligation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>The Tribunal found that the proxy method was
    “extraordinary”, and it viewed an ongoing requirement to obtain information
    from the proxy employer as “a substantial practical impediment”. The Tribunal concluded
    that the Act did not require the use of the proxy method for maintenance and
    added: “[t]he Act’s focus is on the specific compensation practices that
    determine what an employer pays its own female job classes in a given
    establishment.” The Tribunal stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In summary, the Act’s obligation to
    maintain pay equity applies regardless of the methodology of comparison used.
    Pay equity that is achieved under a proxy plan must be maintained. Generally
    speaking, maintenance requires the on-going monitoring of any changes in either
    the compensation or the value (the amalgam of skill, effort, responsibilities
    and working conditions) of female job classes and the male job classes
    (including deemed male job classes) used for comparison purposes. In the case
    of proxy plans, however, maintenance does not require the monitoring of changes
    to the value or compensation of the female job classes in the proxy
    establishment. To so require would be inconsistent with the over-riding principle
    that the Act mandates each individual employer to whom it applies to ensure
    that its own compensation practices are free from gender discrimination.
    Instead, what is required is monitoring of the compensation and value
    relationship of the non-key female job classes and the key female job class as
    compared to the compensation/value relationship (PV line) that has already been
    determined to provide for pay equity. </p>

style='color:black'>The Divisional Court concluded that the Tribunal’s decision

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span

    reject the Tribunal’s position that statutory ambiguity was required before <em>Charter</em> values could be employed to interpret the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Act</span></em>.
    The Divisional Court considered it “settled law that administrative decision
    makers must balance the <em>Charter</em> values at play with the statutory

    conduct its own <em>Charter </em>values analysis. Applying the framework from <em>Doré
    v. Barreau du Québec</em>, 2012 SCC 12, [2012] S.C.R. 395, the Divisional Court
    held that the Tribunal’s decision limited s. 15 of the <em>Charter</em>,
    because it denied “women in predominantly female workplaces (compared to women
    who have male comparators within their establishments) the right to maintain
    pay equity with reference to male work.” It noted that “[t]he fundamental
    precept of pay equity is that there should be equal pay for work of equal value
    between women and men” and that “[t]he touchstone of a pay equity analysis is
    the comparison to male work, as men enjoy the benefit of compensation tied to
    the value of their work as opposed to their gender.”</span></p>

    failed to balance the severity of the interference with s. 15 with the
    statutory objectives of the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Act</span></em>.
    The objectives of the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Act</span></em> include “to ensure such discrimination [in compensation] does not re-emerge.”
    The Tribunal failed to consider the discriminatory effects of its
    interpretation on women in female-dominated workplaces. The Tribunal’s
    interpretation denied these women the right to correct any pay gap that has
    re-emerged since 1994. Maintaining pay equity “by internal comparison of female
    job classes does nothing to ensure that the key female job class wage to which the
    other female classes are compared reflects any re-emergence of a pay equity gap
    since 1994.”</span></p>

    maintenance of pay equity in predominantly female workplaces through the proxy
    method of comparison.” The matter was remitted to the Tribunal to specify the

  <p class=CQuote>We have considered whether the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Act</span></em> is discriminatory on its face because there is no mechanism spelled out in the <em><span

    establishment.” It explained in some detail how it thought that could be
    achieved:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The initial comparison and adjustment of the
    value/compensation ratio of the key female job classes to match the
    value/compensation ratio of the proxy female job classes is capable of being
    expressed as a mathematical formula or equation. The equation may describe a
    gender neutral wage line capable of being plotted on a matrix where the
    increasing value of a job results in movement along the X axis, and where the
    increasing compensation rate of a job results in movement along the Y axis. The
    complexity of the equation will depend on the extent to which the slope of the
    wage line is other than constant. If it is constant, the relationship and the
    equation may be very simply expressed as one of $/point of value.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Regardless of how the compensation/value
    equation is expressed, either of its variables may change over time, with the
    consequence that the other must also change if the same result is to be

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Subsequent to
    January 1, 1994, the two potential triggers engaging the obligation to maintain
    are: a change in the compensation of the key female job class; or a change in
    the value of any of the job classes in the seeking employer's establishment.
    Whenever the hourly rate for the key female job class increases without any
    increase in its value occurring, the $/point ratio will increase. Pay equity
    for the other female job classes will be maintained only if that new ratio also
    obtains for them, and their value has not changed. If the job duties and
    responsibilities of the key female job class change such that its point value
    increases, then its rate of compensation must also increase to maintain
    whatever $/point ratio is applicable at the time. The same is true for the

    and maintain compensation practices that provide for pay equity” (s. 7(1)). Both
    establishing and maintaining pay equity are directed at achieving the purposes

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>First, “achieve” in s. 5.1(1) is not synonymous with “establish”
    in s. 7(1). As a matter of statutory interpretation, “[i]t is presumed that the
    legislature uses language carefully and consistently so that within a statute
    or other legislative instrument the same words have the same meaning and different
    words have different meanings”: Ruth Sullivan, <em>Sullivan on the Construction

style='color:black'>Second, s. 5.1(1) opens with the words “[f]or the purposes
    of the Act”. The purposes of the Act include both establishing <em>and </em>maintaining
    pay equity. As such, the methods in s. 5.1(1) are not limited to establishing
    pay-equity-compliant compensation practices. Rather, they also apply in
    maintaining them.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>Moreover, not using the proxy method to maintain
    pay-equity-compliant compensation practices would undermine the purpose of the
    Act. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span

style='color:black'>The Supreme Court’s decision in </span><em><span
style='color:black'>Alliance</span></em><span style='color:black'> demonstrates
    the inequity that arises when compensation for female employees is not tied to
    that for males on an ongoing basis: </span><em><span style='color:black'>Quebec
    (Attorney General) v. Alliance du personnel professionnel et technique de la
    santé et des services sociaux</span></em><span style='color:black'>, 2018 SCC

style='color:black'>Alliance</span></em><span style='color:black'>, the court
    considered the maintenance provisions of the Quebec legislation, which required
    that women wait five years before applying for pay equity maintenance. At para.
    38, the court identified the systemic nature of pay discrimination and how the
    impugned legislation created barriers to addressing the problem:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Although the
    scheme purports to address systemic discrimination, it in fact codifies the
    denial to women of benefits routinely enjoyed by men – namely, compensation
    tied to the value of their work. Men receive this compensation as a matter of
    course; women, under this scheme, are expected to endure five-year periods of
    pay inequity, and to receive equal compensation only where their employer
    voluntarily acts in a non-discriminatory manner, or where they can meet the
    heavy burden of proving the employer engaged in deliberate or improper conduct.
    The scheme thus places barriers along the path to equal pay for women. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>So too here. The Tribunal’s elimination of male comparators
    for women in predominantly female job classes places “barriers along the path”
    to equal pay for women. I will explain. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span

    SCC 18, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 522 (“<em>CSQ</em>”), explain that “‘women’s work’ is
    valued less than ‘men’s’.”&nbsp;Since the devaluation is systemic, it follows
    that it will continue to exist within the seeking employer's establishment after
    pay equity is established. Any internal adjustment to the value/compensation
    ratio in an establishment without male comparators will include systemic
    assumptions about the value of women's work and result in a smaller adjustment
    than if the work were valued in the same way that men's work is valued. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>The importance of the male comparator is demonstrated by
    the fact that – in non-proxy cases – the Tribunal routinely uses the same
    method for maintaining pay equity as was used to establish pay equity in the
    first place: <em>BICC Phillips</em> (7 October, 1997) 0590-96 (P.E.H.T.); <em>Canadian

    to re-emerge, in job-to-job and proportional value establishments there is
    continual reference back to the male comparators rather than setting a
    value/compensation ratio for the female job classes and maintaining pay equity
    only by reference to that initial ratio.&nbsp;The regular reference back to
    male comparators is undertaken because women's work continues to be systemically
    undervalued. A 1994 ratio cannot account for any devaluation that has taken
    place since that date. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Moreover, since women

    compensation practices that determine what an employer pays its own female job
    classes in a given establishment.” It emphasizes what it describes as “the

    Reasonableness review was, and remains, a deferential form of review. It is a
    form of review that “respects the distinct role of administrative decision
    makers”; involves “a minimum of judicial interference”; and requires a “posture
    of restraint” by the reviewing court: <i>Vavilov</i>, at paras. 75 and 24. As
    the Court reiterates, “[r]easonableness review is an approach meant to ensure
    that courts intervene in administrative matters <i>only where it is truly
    necessary to do so in order to safeguard the legality, rationality and fairness
    of the administrative process</i>,<i>” Vavilov</i> at para. 13 (emphasis

    particular decision is to be assessed having regard to the reasons proffered
    for that decision. The court is not to ask what decision it would have made and
    then compare the decision under review against the benchmark it has
    established. Nor is the court to identify the range of possible decisions that
    could have been made in order to see whether the decision under review falls
    within it. The question for the court is whether the decision under review is
    transparent, intelligible, and justified.</span></p>

    in <i>Vavilov</i> concerns the intensity of the reasonableness review the Court
    endorses. The Court reiterates that “[r]easonableness is a single standard that
    takes its colour from the context”, at para. 89, suggesting differing intensity
    of review, if not different standards, in different contexts:  see David
    Mullan, “Reasonableness Review Post-<i>Vavilov</i>: An “Encomium for
    Correctness”, or Deference as Usual?” (Paper delivered at the What Difference
    will <i>Vavilov</i> Make? Views from Workplace Law and Beyond Webinar, October
    16, 2020) at pp. 16-17. Be that as it may, reasonableness remains a deferential
    form of review, substantially different from correctness, as the Court’s
    emphasis on concepts such as “respect” and “restraint” demonstrates. At the
    same time, however, the Court describes reasonableness as a “robust” form of
    review: <i>Vavilov</i>, at para. 13.</span></p>

    adjective “robust” simply emphasizes that reasonableness review is not to
    function as a rubber stamp, no problem arises. But it must be acknowledged that
    there are statements in the majority decision that appear to be in tension with
    the concept of deference. For example, the Court speaks of constraints on
    administrative decision makers and, significantly, states that there will
    sometimes be only one reasonable interpretation of a statutory provision: <i>Vavilov</i>,
    at paras. 90 and 110. This seems unobjectionable in theory; the legislature is
    usually able to make its intention clear. But how is a court to conclude there
    is but one reasonable interpretation if it is not to perform <i>de novo</i> analysis or determine the correct interpretation of the legislation itself,
    which the Court specifically precludes? The Court acknowledges the problem but
    states simply: “it may sometimes become clear in the course of reviewing a
    decision that the interplay of text, context and purpose leaves room for a
    single reasonable interpretation”: <i>Vavilov</i>, at para. 124.</span></p>

    read in the context of the Court’s endorsement not only of deference, but also
    of the continued importance of an administrative decision maker’s expertise.
    Although expertise is no longer a relevant consideration in determining which
    standard of review applies, it remains important to the manner in which
    reasonableness review is conducted. Specialized knowledge matters. As the Court
    emphasized at para. 93:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-CA>In conducting

    its face nevertheless accords with the purposes and practical realities of the

    and rejected the parties’ focus on compensation changes as the only variable
    with which the maintenance obligation is concerned because it failed to address
    changes in what the Tribunal identified as the key variable: the <i>value</i> of the job classes. The Tribunal rejected the employers’ argument that
    across-the-board wage increases could maintain pay equity; this was true only
    if the value of the job classes in the seeking establishment remained
    unchanged. Similarly, the Tribunal rejected the unions’ argument that wage
    differences between employees in Municipal Homes versus the homes in this case
    meant that pay equity was not being maintained; the <i>Act</i> requires an
    assessment not simply of whether compensation has changed, but whether the
    relative value of job classes compared to their compensation has changed.</span></p>

    wage rates for the same job class varied from one home to another and that
    implementation of pay equity adjustments did not lead to uniform pay rates
    across the homes. Further, although a number of changes occurred since the pay
    equity plan was executed, those changes have not been addressed in the interest
    arbitration process. A pay gap between wages and benefits in the homes and in
    the Municipal Homes developed and increased. That being said, the Tribunal
    emphasized that the obligation to maintain pay equity was more than simply
    accounting for changes in compensation and had to be capable of application to all
    public sector workplaces – both union and non-union, and regardless of the
    operation of interest arbitration.</span></p>

    so: although compensation rates are in the public domain, information about
    changes in job duties and responsibilities is not. The proxy employer’s
    obligation to maintain pay equity in its own establishment makes it difficult
    to determine the pay equity compliant rate for its job classes at any given
    time. The Tribunal considered that there was “a substantial practical
    impediment” to obtaining information to enable a proxy plan to be updated or
    maintained to reflect changes in the value or compensation rates for the proxy
    female job classes. But this was not what the Act requires in any event: the
    focus of the Act is on the compensation practices specific to individual

    They did not agree to a GNCS. They did not evaluate any job classes on the
    basis of the skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions in the
    seeking or proxy establishments. Instead, they simply negotiated a pay equity
    settlement based on the assumptions that the employees possessed similar skills
    whether they worked in a Municipal or private home; they performed the same
    duties under the same conditions; and that their work was of the same value to
    Municipal and private homes. Their negotiated settlement was deemed approved
    despite technical non-compliance with the Act and its validity was not

    in a proxy employer may be attributable to bargaining strength rather than
    systemic discrimination. They may also be attributable to other
    non-discriminatory reasons, even if the employees are performing work of the
    same value. This is a problem because the <i>Pay Equity Act</i> is not intended

    of changes since the pay equity agreement was negotiated could not be
    ascertained. Accordingly, the Tribunal ordered the parties to negotiate and

    classes in the seeking employer. There is no failure of internal rationality

    it stated, at para. 16:</span></p>

    underlying the grant of discretion, including </span><i><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></i><span

    context therefore, is not whether the statutory language is so ambiguous as to
    engage </span><i><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></i><span lang=EN-CA> values,
    it is whether the exercise of discretion by the administrative decision-maker

    ambiguous. The same rule applies for administrative decision makers as for
    courts: <i>Wilson v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles)</i>,
    2015 SCC 47, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 300.</span></p>

    surprising. Statutory interpretation is concerned with identifying and giving
    effect to the intention of the legislature. The <i>Charter</i> does not change
    this. If legislation is in some way inconsistent with the <i>Charter</i> it is
    of no force or effect to the extent of the inconsistency, but before that
    conclusion is reached the legislation may be defended on the basis that it
    establishes a reasonable limit on the <i>Charter</i> right at stake. It is no
    part of the interpreter’s task to preclude a finding of inconsistency with the <i>Charter</i>,
    or the attendant consequences, by interpreting legislation so as to avoid that
    inconsistency. The exception is for legislation that is ambiguous, and the
    ambiguity must be <i>genuine</i>. Iacobucci J. describes genuine ambiguity as
    arising when a statutory provision is “subject to differing, but equally <i>plausible</i>,
    interpretations” (emphasis added): <i>Bell ExpressVu</i> at para. 62. <i>Charter</i> values are not to be used “to create ambiguity where none exists”: <i>R. v.
    Clarke</i>, 2014 SCC 28, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 612, at para. 1.</span></p>

    concept of ambiguity must be emphasized, for ambiguity is a concept that is
    often misunderstood. Genuine ambiguity in a statute is rare; it arises only
    where the legislature has failed to specify between two&nbsp;– rarely more –
    meanings that are semantically possible. Ordinarily, ambiguity can be resolved
    using the tools of statutory interpretation; read in context, the legislature’s
    intended meaning will usually be the only plausible meaning, and hence the
    meaning that must be adopted. In those rare circumstances in which the
    intention of the legislature cannot be inferred it is sensible to adopt the
    interpretation that conforms to <i>Charter</i> values rather than the one that
    does not: the legislature could be presumed to have intended to adopt the
    plausible interpretation that is consistent with <i>Charter</i> values.</span></p>

    confused with vagueness, but the terms are not interchangeable. The various
    forms of indeterminacy and helpful academic authorities are discussed by Miller
    J.A. in <i>Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc. v. Ontario Media Development
    Corporation</i>, 2018 ONCA 555, 142 O.R. (3d) 542, at paras. 44-48. Unlike
    ambiguity, vagueness is anything but rare; indeed, vagueness is ubiquitous in
    many fields of regulation governed by standards rather than rules. Vaguely
    worded legislation has a core of determinate or clear meaning, but a penumbra
    that may be quite large; its application is<i> </i>to this extent <i>underdetermined</i>.
    Legislative standards are often underdetermined, but this is usually resolved
    by caselaw that develops meaning of the vague standard. The “duty to bargain in
    good faith” is a well-known concept in labour relations law that is vague, not
    ambiguous; its meaning is fleshed out in the caselaw of the Labour Relations
    Board, the expert body charged with responsibility for interpreting and
    applying, and so developing, the duty.</span></p>

    of statutory interpretation was not altered by passage of the <i>Charter</i>.
    Administrative decision makers and courts must determine and give effect to the
    intention of the legislature. They are neither mandated nor permitted to
    disregard the intention of the legislature in order to give effect to <i>Charter</i> values. Indeed, the <i>Charter</i> does not require the court to interpret
    legislation in a manner consistent with the <i>rights</i> it specifically
    protects. </span></p>

    Act</i>, both of which require courts to interpret legislation in a manner
    consistent with the rights they protect. But the difference between the <i>Charter</i> and these rights instruments is significant: only the <i>Charter</i> authorizes
    courts to refuse to give effect to legislation that is inconsistent with the
    protected rights. The requirement of rights-consistent interpretation is not
    part of the Canadian approach to statutory interpretation because it is
    necessary to give effect to both the intention of the legislature and the
    supremacy of the Constitution. Put another way: the consequences of
    inconsistency with the <i>Charter</i> are not to be avoided by a strategy of
    adopting rights-consistent interpretations regardless of the legislature’s
    intentions.</span></p>

    application of <i>Charter</i> values is often problematic because of the
    failure to appreciate the difference between concepts such as rights and
    values. The terms are often used interchangeably but they are not
    interchangeable. The <i>Charter</i> is an exhaustive statement of the rights
    and freedoms it protects. In contrast, there is neither a list of <i>Charter</i> values nor a canonical formulation of them: <i>McKitty </i>at para. 95, per
    Miller J.A. Such values as have been recognized – things such as dignity;
    privacy; autonomy; and fairness – are general and abstract concepts. Although
    they trade on the <i>Charter</i> adjective, they are not <i>Charter</i> <i>rights</i>.
    They are, in general, <i>reasons for Charter </i>rights – reasons that help
    explain why certain rights were accorded constitutional protection.</span></p>

    for protecting rights are invariably broader than the rights themselves.
    Consider the concept of dignity. People have rights, we might say, because they
    are possessed of inherent human dignity. But the claims of morality are not
    coextensive with the requirements of legality; not all moral claims find
    expression in constitutionally protected legal rights. Thus, although the
    decision to extend constitutional protection to particular rights arises out of
    respect for human dignity, human dignity is not a freestanding right or freedom
    under the <i>Charter</i>. It is not justiciable <i>per se</i>. Care must be
    taken in identifying and applying <i>Charter</i> values, lest they supplant the

    necessarily broader than the <i>Charter</i> right to equality – a right that is
    limited not only by the text of s. 15 but also by decisions of the court
    emphasizing the negative purpose of the provision in preventing discrimination
    on enumerated and analogous grounds. And of course, s. 15 is, like all <i>Charter</i> rights, subject to such reasonable limits as may be imposed in a free and
