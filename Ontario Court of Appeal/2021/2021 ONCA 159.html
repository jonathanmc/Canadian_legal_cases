  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Thorburn

  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In April 2016, someone hacked into a
    password-protected portal managed by the respondent Family and Children’s
    Services of Lanark, Leeds and Grenville (“FCS”). The hacker took a confidential
    report containing details about the case files and investigations of 285 people.
    A hyperlink to the report was posted on two Facebook pages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both FCS and Laridae Communications Inc.
    (“Laridae”) were insured by Co&#8209;operators General Insurance Company
    (“Co-operators”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>FCS and Laridae claim Co-operators has a duty to
    defend against two claims: (i) a $75 million class action brought against FCS
    in which the representative plaintiff alleges that the leaked document
    contained defamatory material, and that FCS was negligent in securing its
    website; and, (ii) a third-party claim in that proceeding brought by FCS
    against Laridae for negligence and breach of contract.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Co-operators denies having any duty to defend
    FCS or Laridae, relying on policy exclusion clauses in the policies that
    exclude claims arising from the distribution or display of data by means of an
    internet website.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>FCS, Laridae, and Co-operators brought
    applications to interpret the policies under Rule 14.05(3)(d) of the <em>Ontario
    Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her endorsement, dated May 8, 2020, the application
    judge found that the Co-operators had a duty to defend both claims. She held
    that:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the applicability of the data exclusion clauses
    was a “novel interpretation issue” and accordingly the duty to defend should
    only be denied on a full record, not on an application;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the data exclusion clause does not exclude
    Co-operators’ duty to defend the class action;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the data exclusion clause does not exclude
    Co-operators’ duty to defend the third-party claim against Laridae; and,</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>neither FCS nor Laridae has any reporting
    obligations to Co-operators, in light of the conflict of interest between the
    two insured and the insurer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In these companion appeals, Co-operators claims these
    conclusions were wrong. Co-operators argues that the duty-to-defend issue can
    properly be determined on the application, and that the data exclusion clauses
    preclude coverage of both the class action against FCS and the third-party
    claim brought by FCS against Laridae. It also argues that, even if there was
    duty to defend, Co&#8209;operators would have the right to participate in the
    insured parties’ defences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons discussed below, I would allow
    the appeal. The existence of a duty to defend in this case can be resolved by
    application. Co-operators has no duty to defend FCS in the class action
    proceeding, and no duty to defend Laridae in the third-party claim. Even if
    such a duty did exist, it would not deprive Co-operators of its right to
    participate in the defence, including receiving reports from counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Below, I set out (i) the terms of the contract
    between FCS and Laridae; (ii) the claims made in the class action against FCS,
    and by FCS against Laridae in the third-party claim; and (iii) Co-operators’
    refusal to defend the claims. I then outline the relevant policy provisions, and
    summarize the application judge’s decision. Finally, I analyze and provide my
    conclusions regarding: (i) whether the duty to defend can be denied on the
    basis of the material before the application judge; (ii) whether Co-operators
    has a duty to defend; and (iii) whether, if Co&#8209;operators had a duty to
    defend, it would have the right to participate in the defence.</span></p>

  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>THE APPLICATION JUDGE’S DECISION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the application, Co-operators argued it had
    no duty to defend, because coverage was excluded by the data exclusion clauses.
    FCS and Laridae argued that the data exclusion clause did not exclude all the
    claims against them. In the alternative, FCS and Laridae argued that exclusion
    clauses which have the effect of nullifying the insurance the insurer undertook
    to provide, will not be enforced. They argued that this was an important issue
    that should not be determined on a “duty to defend” application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge concluded, at para. 28,
    that the claims in respect of which FCS and Laridae sought coverage “are broad
    and comprehensive and not limited to the distribution of the Report on the
    internet. The Claims do include damages for non-electronic distribution (i.e.
    physical distribution) of the Report or other private information.” In coming
    to that conclusion, she relied on para. 19 of the amended statement of claim in
    the class action, which asserts that “the personal information of the class
    members can be accessed by any unauthorized third party who accessed the information,
    bought the information, or found the information posted on the internet…”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, although all three parties brought
    applications regarding the interpretation of the insurance policies, the
    application judge held that whether Co&#8209;operators should be able to rely
    on the data exclusion clauses to deny a duty to defend was an important issue
    that should not be determined on an application. At para. 36, she held that:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[U]ntil the courts have had an opportunity
    to adjudicate the complex issues raised by these broadly worded data exclusion
    clauses, it would be improper for this court, having regard to present
    jurisprudence to uphold Co-operators’ denial of a duty to defend.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After making this remark, she went on to find
    there was a possibility of coverage:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Further, I can not find on these
    Applications that <br>
    Co-operators has not discharged its onus of establishing that the substance of
    the Claims clearly fall within the Data Exclusion Clauses and that there is no
    possibility of coverage under the Policies. Rather, in addition to the issue of
    the interpretation of the Data Exclusion Clauses, it is apparent that there are
    claims and allegations in the Class Proceeding and the Third-Party Claim that would
    not [be] excluded by the Data Exclusion Clauses. As there is at least some
    possibility that the Claims are covered under the Policies, I find that
    Co-operators owes a duty to defend Laridae and FCS.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the application judge held that if
    there is a conflict of interest due to competing interests as between FCS and
    Laridae, Co-operators&nbsp;must fund each defence with independent counsel, neither
    of whom reports to Co-operators.&nbsp;The judgment provides that FCS and
    Laridae “are each entitled to appoint and instruct counsel, such instruction
    shall not include resolution or settlement of any part or portion of the
    litigation without the consent of Co-operators, and is without prejudice to the
    rights of Co-operators to bring a motion to vary the Order if the conflict of
    interest is resolved.”</span></p>

    that it would be “improper” to uphold Co-operators’ denial of the duty to

    electronic file … held electronically in a portal”;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The portal was “illegally hacked”, the personal
    information was posted on “Smith’s Falls Swapshop Facebook page and/or other
    public websites”; and,</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was “made readily available” to an
    unauthorized person who “accessed, bought or found the information on the
    internet” resulting in damages to the Class.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, contrary to the assertion made by
    the application judge, there is no claim in the class action that there was a physical
    display or distribution of the confidential personal information. The claim is
    that the confidential report was made public, “<u>by posting it on Smith's
    Falls Swapshop Facebook page</u> and/or other public websites, thereby
    disclosing personal and highly sensitive information of the plaintiff and class
    members” and that, “<u>[a]s a result</u>, the personal information of the class
    members has now been made readily available … resulting in damages” (emphasis
    added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The pleading in the class action is that the
    damages arose from posting the Report on the internet. This is sufficient to
    conclude that there is no duty to defend the class action as this allegation
    fits squarely within the policy exclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, even if the class action did include
    an allegation that physical copies of Report were taken or created, which it
    does not, the substance and true nature of the claim for damages <em>arises</em> from the wrongful appropriation of confidential personal information and
    posting it on the internet. There is only one chain of causation as all injury
    flows from the display or distribution of physical copies follows from the
    first wrongful act.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is also true in the case of the third-party
    claim. In the third-party claim, FCS claims:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Contribution and indemnity for any damages
    payable in the class action;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Damages for negligent advice and representations
    in the course of providing general consulting services under its agreement with
    FCS;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Damages for failing to adequately secure the
    website; and,</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Damages relating to reputational harm,
    investigation costs, and repair costs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While I appreciate that Rule 29.01 of the <em>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</em> allows a defendant to commence a third-party claim
    against a person who is not a party to the action for “an independent claim for
    damages or other relief arising out of … a related transaction or occurrence or
    series of transactions or occurrences”, there is no independent claim for
    damages in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The data exclusion clause excludes claims that
    arise from the display and distribution of the confidential personal information
    on the internet. All of the injuries pleaded in the third-party claim arise,
    ultimately, from the distribution of the Report on the internet. There is only
    one chain of causation. As in the class action, the substance and true nature
    of the claim for damages arises from the wrongful appropriation of confidential
    personal information and posting it on the internet.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the data exclusion clause excludes
    coverage for the defence of both the class action and the third-party claim
    and, on the facts as pleaded, there is no possibility that a claim within the
    policy may succeed.</span></p>
  <p class=KHeading10><span lang=EN-CA>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Would denial of coverage result in nullification
    of coverage under the policy?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The third point raised by FCS and Laridae is
    that, if the data exclusion clause in the policies applies in this case, giving
    effect to the data exclusion clause would impermissibly nullify coverage under the
    policy. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Zurich Insurance Co. v. 686234 Ontario

color:#212121'> </span><span lang=EN-CA>[2003] S.C.C.A. No. 33, Borins J.A.
    explained, at para. 28, that even a clear and unambiguous exclusion clause will
    not be applied where: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>it is inconsistent with the main purpose of the

  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the result would be to effectively nullify the

  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>to apply the exclusion clause would be contrary
    to the reasonable expectations of the ordinary purchaser of the coverage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, this case is distinguishable from <em>Zurich</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, unlike the decision in <em>Zurich</em>, the
    exclusion is entirely consistent with the main purpose of the insurance
    coverage, which is to provide compensatory damages for personal injury arising
    from the conduct of business except in accordance with specific exclusions
    under the policy. The policies provide coverage for a range of services
    provided by Laridae and specifically, its provision of “Professional Services”
    to FCS. Only one of those services was to update and secure the FCS website.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, given that the Co-operators policies
    provide coverage for a range of services which extend beyond the terms of this
    policy exclusion, the exclusion clause would not nullify the coverage provided under
    the policy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Third, exclusion of these claims pursuant to the exclusion clauses
    would not be contrary to the reasonable expectation of the parties. The potential
    effect of the data exclusion clauses is apparent on the face of the policies. Unlike <em>Zurich</em>, where “a reasonable policyholder would expect that the policy
    insured the very risk that occurred”, a reasonable policyholder in this case would
    expect that the data exclusion clause would exclude the dissemination of a
    sensitive Report over social media: <em>Zurich</em>, at para. 39.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In <em>G &amp; P Procleaners and General Contractors Inc. v. Gore
    Mutual Insurance Co.</em>, 2017 ONCA 298, 335 O.A.C. 172, at paras. 24-25<em>,</em> this court considered and rejected a similar nullification argument. This court
    observed that commercial general liability policies:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>… are not “all-risk” policies. They do not
    insure the manner in which the insured conducts its business. They do not
    generally cover the cost of repairing the insured’s own defective or faulty
    work product. That is what the parties in the present case bargained for. To
    hold them to that bargain is entirely reasonable and does not render the
    coverage under the policy meaningless. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Like the insurer in <em>G &amp; P Procleaners, </em>the Co-operators’
    policies do not insure against all risks. They clearly articulate what is and is
    not covered. Non-bodily injury arising from the display or distribution or data
    on the internet is not covered by their terms. To hold the parties to this
    bargain is consistent with the provisions in the policy, it does not nullify
    the effect of the policies, and it accords with the reasonable expectations of
    the parties.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>Conclusion on the duty-to-defend issue</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In summary, I find that Co-operators owes no duty to defend either
    FCS or Laridae because (i) the exclusion clauses are unambiguous, (ii) all
    claims asserted in these proceedings are covered by the clear language of the
    exclusion clauses, and (iii) denial of coverage would not nullify the policies.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Given my conclusion that Co-operators has no duty to defend, it is
    unnecessary to address the third issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:#212529'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, I note that the parties agreed at the
    hearing that, if Co-operators did have a duty to defend, Co-operators should receive
    reports from counsel who have been acting for FCS and Laridae for the last four
    years, and have the ability to jointly instruct counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>They also agreed that, should Co-operators have a duty to defend, it
    would be appropriate to establish a joint protocol for the management of
    documents and the litigation, similar to that ordered by this court in <em>Markham

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The establishment of such a protocol reflects the balance between
    the insured’s right to a full and fair defence of the civil action and the
    insurer’s right to control that defence because of its potential ultimate
    obligation to indemnify: see <em>Brockton (Municipality) v. Frank Cowan Co.</em><span
class=reflex3-block>, </span>57 O.R. (3d) 447 (Ont. C.A.). It also reflects the
    fact that an insurer that has reserved its rights on coverage does not lose its
    right to control the defence and appoint counsel unless, in the circumstances, a
    reasonable apprehension of conflict of interest would arise if counsel were to
    act for both the insurer and the insured: <em>Brockton, </em>at paras. 39-40,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The onus is on the insured to establish such a reasonable
