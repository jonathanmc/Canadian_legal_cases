lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Borel appeals from his conviction for
    attempted murder. He also seeks leave to appeal the sentence of 19 ½ years imposed
    upon him. For the reasons that follow, I would allow the conviction appeal and
    order a new trial. As a consequence, I do not reach the sentence appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In September 2010, the appellant and the complainant
    began an affair. The complainant was married and lived with her husband and her
    teenaged children. The appellant was not married and lived with the mother of
    his children in a platonic relationship. In December 2010, the complainant’s
    husband found out about the affair. The complainant told her husband that it
    was over, but in fact she continued the affair. The complainant, who had a
    drinking problem, began to drink more heavily.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the evidence of the complainant and
    the appellant differed as to the state of their relationship in July 2011. Each
    claimed to be the one trying to end it. On July 23, 2011, sometime around 6:00
    pm, the complainant left her house telling her husband that she was going
    shopping and then to a friend’s house. The story was a lie. The complainant was
    actually going to meet the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant and the appellant met in the
    parking lot of a community centre. The appellant arrived first. A little before
    6:45 pm, the appellant called 911. When the police and EMS arrived, the complainant
    was lying on the ground in the parking lot very badly burned. The appellant and
    some passersby were with her. The complainant smelled of gasoline.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant initially told the paramedic that
    he was driving past the community centre and noticed his friend in the parking
    lot. In contrast, he told the police officer at the scene that he did not know who
    the complainant was. He later told the police officer that he did know the complainant
    and that they had arranged to meet that evening. Later that evening at the
    police station, the appellant gave a videotaped statement to the police. Four
    days later, the appellant was arrested and charged with attempted murder. He then
    gave another, more detailed, videotaped statement to the police. Throughout his
    interactions with the police and others, the appellant consistently denied
    having doused the complainant with gasoline and setting her on fire.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the complainant gave evidence about
    her relationship with the appellant. According to the complainant, there were a
    lot of trust and jealousy issues. She said that the appellant started getting
    physically and verbally aggressive. She described an incident in October or
    November of 2010 where the appellant grabbed her around the neck and strangled
    her to the point that she could not breathe. In response, she kicked him. He
    then let go but grabbed her by the arms leaving bruises.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant told her husband that the affair
    was over in December 2010 but it continued into 2011, although the complainant
    testified that it was getting “harder and harder to sneak around”. According to
    the complainant, the appellant was getting more aggressive and wanted her to
    leave her husband.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified about a second violent
    incident sometime in January or February 2011 when she and the appellant were
    at a motel. She testified that the appellant took her phone and saw that she
    had been talking to a male friend. The appellant became jealous and aggressive
    and proceeded to smother her head and face with a pillow.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant gave evidence at trial and denied
    that either of these violent incidents had occurred. The appellant testified
    that he did see marks on the complainant, who told him a few times that she was
    fighting with her husband.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In early 2011, the complainant got pregnant with
    the appellant’s child. She terminated the pregnancy in April. Following the
    abortion, she and the appellant stayed together in a hotel for a number of days.
    The complainant did not think she told her husband at the time about the
    pregnancy. She and the appellant also got similar tattoos in memory of the
    baby. Each testified that it was the other’s idea.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following her abortion, the complainant kept
    seeing the appellant. The complainant testified that she cared for the
    appellant and was scared to leave because she knew there would be consequences.
    In May 2011, she suggested that they should end it. She said that the appellant
    seemed upset but accepting. Afterwards, however, the complainant received
    several emails from the appellant stating, “fuck you baby killer,” “you fucked
    with the wrong guy,” “wait till the real fireworks start,” and “I fucking hate
    you.” The appellant testified that they argued a lot, but it was mostly over the
    complainant’s excessive drinking.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sometime in March to June 2011, the complainant
    told her husband that she did not love him anymore and that she wanted to move
    out. During the time after her abortion, the complainant drank heavily. She was
    depressed. The complainant once told her husband that she was going to take all
    the sleeping pills. Her husband thought that this was a dramatic gesture to
    make him feel guilty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On July 23, 2011, the day of the incident, the complainant
    testified that she met the appellant at Rockway Community Centre. She left home
    around 5:50 pm. She had been drinking and admitted that it was possible that
    had she had alcohol in the car with her. The appellant was already present in
    the parking lot when the complainant pulled up at the community centre. They
    both got out of their cars and were standing in the parking lot. According to
    the complainant, the appellant told her that he had a “present” in his car for
    her. He proceeded to walk to his car and then walked back to her location with a
    black jug full of gas. The appellant started “swishing” the gas at the complainant.
    He took a match out of his pocket and threw it at her, setting her on fire.
    According to the complainant, the appellant stood there with his arms crossed
    and said, “fuck you bitch, you mess with the wrong people’s feelings and you’ll
    pay.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant acknowledged arriving at the
    community centre. He arrived first. When the complainant arrived, the appellant
    said that he knew right away that she had been drinking. The appellant said
    that he immediately got upset and asked her why she was drinking again. He told
    her that he did not want her driving to her friend’s home, which is where the complainant
    was intending to go after meeting the appellant. The complainant told the
    appellant that she could drive to the friend’s home on her own. The complainant
    and the appellant continued to argue about her drinking and driving. The appellant
    told the complainant that, if she refused to take a ride from him or call
    someone else, he was going to call the police. The appellant said that he had
    done this before.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant went back to his car to make a
    call. He then heard a scream. This was approximately 10 minutes from the time the
    complainant had arrived at the community centre. He thought the complainant was
    just trying to get his attention. The appellant glanced over his shoulder and
    saw the complainant enter a trail that leads from the parking lot. She was screaming
    loudly. The appellant then ran to the trail and found the complainant lying
    face down and kind of rolling around. She appeared to be burning. The complainant
    rolled over. The appellant saw that she was burnt. He asked her “What happened?
    Who did this?” She was screaming and replied “nobody”. The appellant testified
    that it was horrifying and that he did not know what to think. He helped the complainant
    up and back to the parking lot and then called 911.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While waiting for the police to arrive, the
    appellant says that the complainant kept getting up and wandering towards the
    road. While waiting for the police, the complainant pleaded with the appellant
    not to tell the police who she was. The appellant repeatedly asked her: “Did someone
    do this to you? Did somebody attack you or something?” The complainant answered
    “nobody”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Prior to the arrival of the EMS and the police,
    several people driving by stopped to assist. One testified that the appellant
    said he did not know the woman or know what happened. Another testified that
    the appellant said he did not know what happened and that he had made
    arrangements with the complainant to go hiking and that he arrived to find her
    in that state. A third testified that the appellant said that he did not know
    who did this and was supposed to meet the complainant. The appellant was on the
    phone to 911 while the on-scene witnesses were present.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police and EMS arrived. The appellant told
    EMS that he had been driving by and noticed his friend in the parking lot. He
    told them that he knew her and told them her name. However, the first officer
    on scene said that he asked the people present, including the appellant, if
    they knew the complainant. Everyone, including the appellant, stated that they
    did not know who the woman was. The appellant testified he did this because of the
    complainant’s request, prior to the police attending, not to say her name. Upon
    being questioned by the same officer, the complainant also refused to tell him
    her name. The appellant later told the officer and EMS personnel the complainant’s
    name and that she was a friend of his and that they were supposed to meet
    there. He handed the officer a set of keys, a lighter and matches – telling the
    officer that they were in the complainant’s hand and that they belonged to her.
    He also told the officer that the complainant was not his girlfriend but had
    met up with her because she was an alcoholic needing support.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A five-hour search of the immediate area at the
    community centre by a number of police officers did not reveal any evidence of
    an accelerant container. An expert in the behaviour of gasoline and ignition
    source testified that if one swished gas in a backward motion (as described by the
    complainant), one would expect a transfer of gasoline onto that person’s clothes
    and shoes. One would also expect to find some gasoline on the ground. The appellant’s
    clothes (t-shirt and shorts) were tested for gasoline. They showed no traces of
    gasoline. There was no odour of gasoline around the appellant’s car. However,
    there was a strong odour of gasoline in the complainant’s car - gasoline was
    located on the driver’s seat of the complainant’s car, in her purse, and in a
    cup holder.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant denied throwing gasoline on the complainant
    and setting her on fire. He was unsure how the fire was caused. He denied that
    he went to the location with the intention of harming the complainant.</span></p>

    played the 13-minute 911 call. Then, following a few brief introductory
    questions, the Crown began his examination-in-chief by asking the dispatcher,
    given her experience: “was there anything unusual about this, about this particular
    [911] call.” The dispatcher testified that, in her opinion, the call she
    received from the appellant was “weird.” The dispatcher noted that the appellant
    initially stated that the patient was assaulted and then later in the call said
    she had been burned. Further, the dispatcher found it odd that if the appellant
    had just come upon the patient, who was unable to communicate, why would he not
    have just told her that the patient was burned rather than assaulted.</span></span></p>

lang=EN-CA>R. v. Khelawon</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span
lang=EN-CA>, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, on two bases. One was that they
    formed part of the narrative. The other was to rebut a possible defence that
    the incident was the result of a suicide attempt or an accident. Towards the
    end of her reasons, the trial judge said:</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>It is also important
    to note that the Crown is not asking that the statements be admitted for the
    truth of their content, but simply as part of the narrative as it unfolds, and

    accidental or caused by [the complainant] herself.</span></span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>The problem with the trial judge’s
    acceptance of the Crown’s position is that it does not coincide with the actual
    purpose for admitting the evidence, at least on the second stated basis.
    Insofar as the evidence was being admitted to rebut accident or suicide, it
    could only achieve that purpose if the evidence was admitted for the truth of its
    contents, which would carry with it the risk that the jury would also use it as
    confirmation on the issue of identity. </span></span></p>

    another confusing aspect of the trial judge’s ruling. Early in her reasons, the
    trial judge held that the actions of the complainant, in shaking her head or
    nodding, were not statements, and thus were not hearsay. She said: “However,
    any actions observed by someone else, in this case, the emergency care
    personnel, are not hearsay, and [the EMS attendant] is free to testify about
    what she says she observed [the complainant] do.” Consequently, the trial judge
    held that those actions were admissible without any hearsay analysis. The respondent
    admits that this latter finding is clearly wrong. “Hearsay typically consists
    of spoken words. It can, however, consist of conduct.”: </span></span><em><span

    the issue became even more confused when it reached the stage of the
    instructions to the jury. The trial judge first told the jury that they had
    heard the evidence about the statements for the two purposes stated above but
    not “to prove that what she said is true, but only to establish that the
    statements were made”. However, only a short time later, the trial judge told
    the jury:</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>If you decide that
    [the complainant] did make these statements, you may consider that evidence in
    deciding whether or not [the complainant] would have made these statements if
    her injuries were self-inflicted or occurred as a result of an accident.</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In determining how much or how little you will
    rely on this evidence, to help you decide this case, you may consider that it
    may be less reliable than other evidence that has been given. [The complainant]
    has no memory of this point in time. Accordingly, she was not subject to cross-examination
    on this issue. At the same time, you may consider whether there is any evidence
    to suggest a motive on the part of [the complainant] to lie to the emergency
    responders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>It is evident
    that, at this point in her charge, the trial judge is clearly indicating to the

    critical piece of evidence arising from this issue is the evidence of the complainant
    apparently nodding in the affirmative when she was asked whether the attacker
    was her boyfriend. The trial judge did not isolate this piece of evidence in
    her instructions to the jury and, consequently, she did not give any cautionary
    instruction to the jury about its use, presumably because she continued to view
    it as direct evidence and not as hearsay.</span></span></p>

    evidence went to the central issue of the identity of the attacker and was the
    evidence that carried with it the highest danger of misuse. This fact is
    important because evidence is admitted for a purpose, and that purpose must be
    clearly identified. Here the Crown was tendering the evidence that the
    complainant nodded her head in response to questions in order to prove the
    identity of the appellant as her attacker even though the Crown had the direct
    evidence of the complainant on this point.</span></span></p>

    case, none of this evidence was admissible for either of the purposes it was
    offered by the Crown. More specifically, it was not admissible under the
    principled exception to the hearsay rule for the truth of its contents as a
    positive identification of the appellant as the complainant’s attacker. For
    that purpose, the evidence does not fit within the principled exception because
    the evidence does not meet the twin requirements of necessity and reliability. I
    would reject trial counsel’s concession and the trial judge’s conclusion that all
    of this evidence, including the head nodding, met the necessity requirement. I

    it was not necessary for this evidence to be admitted for that purpose. While
    the complainant may not have remembered the events in the ambulance, as
    recounted by the EMS attendant, the complainant was available to give evidence about
    the actual event and she identified the appellant as her attacker. Indeed, she
    did so at the very first opportunity after she awoke from a coma that resulted
    from her injuries. There was, therefore, no need for this evidence to fill any
    evidentiary gap on that central point. Because the necessity requirement could
    not be met, the only purpose for admitting this evidence was as a prior
    consistent statement by the complainant to buttress her evidence as to the
    identity of her attacker. Prior consistent statements are presumptively
    inadmissible because they lack probative value: </span></span><em><span

    to be admitted for that purpose. No part of outlining the narrative or chain of
    events for the jury required its admission. The only part of the narrative that
    was involved at this stage was the transportation of the complainant to the
    hospital. That part of the narrative could have been adequately conveyed
    without any reference to this evidence. On this point, “narrative” is too often
    used by counsel, supported by trial judges, as a vehicle for the admission of
    evidence that is otherwise inadmissible and prejudicial. The practice of using
    this route to admit prejudicial evidence must stop because this error will
    often lead to the requirement for a new trial, with the resulting hardships and
    expense that inevitably flow. Trial judges must be alert to the potential for
    such misuse and be on guard to bar this door.</span></span></p>

    The defence clearly took issue with the complainant’s claim that she was
    attacked, along with her identification of the appellant as her attacker. Suicide
    or accident were other possible explanations for the incident. With respect to
    those explanations, however, it was never suggested that the complainant’s
    identification of the appellant as her attacker was triggered by a motive to
    fabricate that arose after the statements to EMS were made. To the contrary, the
