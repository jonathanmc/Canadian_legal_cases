lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>McDonald’s Restaurants of Canada Limited (“McDonald’s”)
    moves for an order declaring North Elgin Centre Inc. (“NEC”) in contempt of the
    order of a panel of this court dated January 29, 2018 (the “Order”). That Order
    was made in respect of the renewal of a lease between NEC, as landlord, and
    McDonald’s, as tenant, for commercial property located in Richmond Hill,
    Ontario (the “Lease”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Order declared that the Lease had been
    renewed for a first renewal term running from March 11, 2017 to March 10, 2027.
    Since the renewal term requires consent approval under s. 50(3)(f) of the <em>Planning
    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> para. 3(b) of the Order states:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>McDonald’s shall, within 30 days of the date
    of the issuance of the reasons by the Court, bring an application for the
    consent required under s. 50(3)(f) of the <em>Planning Act</em> and the
    Respondent, [NEC], shall provide all reasonable cooperation to obtain that
    consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>McDonald’s alleges that NEC has acted in ways
    that breached the Order’s requirement that it “provide all reasonable
    cooperation” to obtain the <em>Planning Act</em> consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>NEC has brought a cross-motion that seeks
    declaratory relief in the nature of defences to the contempt motion, as well as
    directions regarding its obligations under para. 3(b) of the Order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Contempt proceedings proceed in two stages: a
    liability phase, followed by a penalty phase: <em>Carey v. Laiken</em>, 2015
    SCC 17, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 79, at para. 18. These are my reasons for the liability
    phase of McDonald’s contempt motion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I will explain below, I dismiss McDonald’s
    motion. Given the basis for my conclusion that NEC is not in contempt of the
    Order, it is not necessary to decide the issues raised by NEC’s cross-motion,
    so I dismiss that motion.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>II.       JURISDICTION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>McDonald’s initially sought to bring its contempt
    motion before the panel that made the Order. The panel invited submissions from
    the parties on the appropriate procedure to hear the contempt motion. NEC’s
    submissions disclosed that it intended to bring a cross-motion seeking
    directions as to whether the Lease was void because <em>Planning Act</em> consent was not obtained before the expiry of 21 years or, alternatively,
    directions about what NEC could “do or not do having regard to paragraph 3(b)
    of the Court’s Order.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The panel advised that a settlement conference
    would take place before Pardu J.A., which occurred on June 10, 2020. No
    settlement was reached. By order dated June 19, 2020, Pardu J.A. gave
    directions regarding the hearing of the motions (the “Directions Order”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Directions Order provided that “the motion
    for contempt and a motion for directions and for declaratory relief, if brought
    by North Elgin, be heard together by a single judge of the Court of Appeal.”
    However, “[t]his is without prejudice to the right of the judge hearing both
    motions to determine whether the court has jurisdiction to give the declaratory
    relief sought.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Neither party objects to a single judge of this
    court hearing the motions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the parties were not able to locate any
    jurisprudence of this court on the issue of the jurisdiction of a single judge
    to hear a contempt motion to enforce a panel order,</span><a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></span></a><span
lang=EN-CA> I am satisfied that the combined operation of the <em>Courts of
    Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (“<em>CJA</em>”), and the <em>Rules of
    Civil Procedure</em> provides such jurisdiction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em> apply to
    all civil proceedings in the Court of Appeal, subject to a few exceptions which
    do not apply to these motions: r. 1.02(1). Rule 60.11(1) requires that a
    contempt order to enforce an order requiring a person to do an act must be
    obtained “on motion to a judge in the proceeding in which the order to be
    enforced was made.” Where the order to be enforced is one made by the Court of
    Appeal, a contempt motion therefore must be brought in the Court of Appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 7(2) of the <em>CJA</em> provides that a
    motion in the Court of Appeal shall be heard and determined by one judge,
    subject to the exceptions enumerated in s. 7(3), none of which include a
    contempt motion. I therefore conclude that a single judge of this court has the
    jurisdiction to hear a contempt motion to enforce an order made by a panel of
    the court.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>III.      BACKGROUND FACTS</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The lease renewal dispute</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>NEC owns a parcel of land at the north-east
    corner of Yonge Street and Bernard Avenue on which it operates a shopping plaza
    (the “Property”). Under the Lease that commenced March 11, 1997, NEC leases
    part of the Property to McDonald’s, which operates a restaurant on the demised
    premises. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The initial term of the Lease was for 20 years,
    expiring on March 10, 2017, with McDonald’s having options to extend the term
    for two additional consecutive terms of ten years each.</span><a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[3]</span></span></span></span></a><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Property is located within a planning
    intensification area, known as a Key Development Area (“KDA”), in the 2010 Richmond
    Hill Official Plan. In 2016, the Town of Richmond Hill (the “Town”) initiated a
    process to prepare a secondary plan and zoning by-law for the KDA. As part of
    that process, NEC provided Town staff with a concept plan and parking strategy
    for the future development of the Property. The concept plan contemplates a
    high-density, mixed use, transit supportive development on the Property and
    shows that eventually a residential tower may be located on the site presently
    occupied by the McDonald’s restaurant. In late 2017, NEC and other area
    landowners appealed the secondary plan and zoning by-law to the Local Planning
    Appeal Tribunal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 19.10 of the Lease provides that it is
    subject to the <em>Planning Act</em>. As noted, s. 50(3)(f) of that Act provides,
    in part, that no person shall enter into any agreement that has the effect of
    granting the use of or right in land “directly or by entitlement to renewal for
    a period of twenty-one years or more unless … (f) a consent is given to convey,
    mortgage or charge the land, or grant, assign or exercise a power of
    appointment in respect of the land or enter into an agreement in respect of the
    land.” Section 19.10 of the Lease places the obligation on the landlord, NEC,
    to seek any <em>Planning Act</em> consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2016, a dispute arose over McDonald’s
    exercise of its first right to renew the term of the Lease for an additional 10
    years. The dispute went to court, where the application judge found that the
    Lease had come to an end in March 2017 as McDonald’s had failed to comply with
    the renewal provision: 2017 ONSC 3306, 87 R.P.R. (5th) 303.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In January 2018, this court allowed McDonald’s
    appeal, declaring the Lease had been renewed for the first 10-year renewal term
    and referring the rent dispute for the renewal term to arbitration: 2018 ONCA
    71, 87 R.P.R. (5th) 315, at para. 13. This court then dealt, at para. 14, with
    the need to obtain consent under the <em>Planning Act</em> for the first
    renewal term: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>With regard to McDonald’s claim for an order
    requiring North Elgin to specifically perform its obligation to obtain a <em>Planning
    Act</em> consent, we note that the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> year under the
    Lease is fast approaching. We proposed to the parties in oral argument that the
    most sensible order would be one in which McDonald’s was permitted to
    immediately bring an application for the consent, and North Elgin would provide
    all reasonable cooperation to obtain the consent. The parties were agreeable to
    that order, and it shall issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Para. 3(b) of the Order set out the parties’
    obligations in respect of the <em>Planning Act</em> consent application,
    including requiring NEC to “provide all reasonable cooperation to obtain that
    consent.” </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Consent Application</span></h1>

    (therefore, easement approvals are not required).</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the summer of 2018 McDonald’s obtained from
    NEC copies of concept plans NEC had prepared in 2017 for the development of the

    not make provision for a site for its restaurant and asked NEC to submit
    revised concept plans to the Town.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By letter dated August 9, 2018, NEC’s counsel
    confirmed that “NEC is not only consenting to your client's application for <em>Planning
    Act</em> approval but has even allowed the application to be made by your
    client in its name. As far as the Town of Richmond Hill (“the Municipality”) is
    concerned, NEC is 100% behind the application for the <em>Planning Act</em> approval.” The letter noted that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>3. The reason the Municipality requested a
    Planning Justification Report in support of your client’s application is
    because your client’s application conflicts with and creates issues arising
    from (i) the Zoning By-Law, (ii) the Official Plan and (iii) an Interim Control
    By-Law…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>4. Toward the bottom of page 4 of your letter,
    you are asking NEC to provide a “planning justification report outlining what
    is needed in order for the restaurant to comply.” However, it is strictly your
    client’s obligation to prepare and submit the Planning Justification Report
    supporting its application that has been requested by the Municipality…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>5. You also seem to believe that any NEC
    concept plans have affected your client’s application. That is manifestly
    incorrect. What is relevant are the Municipality’s Zoning By-Law, Official Plan
    and Interim Control By-Law. While there is a non-conforming use for the leased
    lands, your client must nevertheless satisfy the Municipality with respect to
    its application for the <em>Planning Act</em> approval sought. It is simply up
    to your client to once and for all proceed with and submit a Planning
    Justification Report which will hopefully persuade the Municipality to approve
    the application for <em>Planning Act</em> approval.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The IBI report filed by McDonald's in support
    of the consent application (the September 2019 report) contains inaccurate statements
    (opinions) regarding the future development potential and timing of the NEC

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There appear to be at least two issues – (1)
    the temporal impact of a consent and (2) the spatial extent of any consent on the
    NEC lands.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b><i><span lang=EN-CA>1. The lease was renewed for a 10 year
    term (not up to 18 years and 4 months). This was not disclosed in the IBI

    which would expire in 2027.</span></i></b></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>2. In any event, the lease contains a no build
    zone clause (lease par 22.03 and schedule E4) - which consists of the entire
    NEC site. This clause (and its impact) was not disclosed or discussed in the
    IBI report, nor made known to the city planner or planning department who now
    request an acknowledgement letter from NEC. (Of course, the City knows that there
    is a Secondary Plan and Zoning Bylaw before LPAT for approval).</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>NEC does not wish to be a party to an

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In order for the proposed Consent Application
    to be supportable, the following CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL are necessary and
    reasonable:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b><i><span lang=EN-CA>1. The Consent shall be limited to 8
    years, being the remaining portion of the renewal term. The owner or McDonalds
    may apply for a further Consent should McDonald’s seek to renew the lease for
    the 2<sup>nd</sup> renewal term.</span></i></b></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Reason: The Lease was only renewed for the 1<sup>st</sup> renewal term.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b><i><span lang=EN-CA>2. The Consent shall apply to the area
    of land shown on Appendix B.</span></i></b></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Reason: Appendix B ensures that the subject
    lands can be redeveloped in phases, if necessary, in accordance with the
    Provincial, Regional and Municipal mandated intensification policies including
    provision of more affordable housing options including purpose built rental
    units, while providing for McDonald’s continued use of the severed lands for
    the remainder of the renewal term.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b><i><span lang=EN-CA>3. The consent approval does not apply
    to, and no sanction is given to, Section 22.03 and Schedule E-4 to the Lease
    and to Sections 22.01, 22.02 and 22.04 of the Lease.</span></i></b></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Reason: The No Build Zone provision and
    related sections sterilize the NEC property and therefore do not meet the
    Planning Act requirements referred to above. <span class=EmphasisStrongChar>The
    condition is intended to ensure that consent to the 1<sup>st</sup> renewal term
    does not freeze development on the retained lands and removes any restriction

    intentional act or omission that is in fact in breach of a clear order of which
    the alleged contemnor has notice</a>: <em>Carey</em>, at para. 38. Contumacy –
    the intent to interfere with the administration of justice – is not an element

lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With civil contempt, where there is no element
    of public defiance, the purpose of a contempt order is seen primarily as
    coercive rather than punitive, with the court attempting to obtain compliance
    with its order: <em>United Nurses of Alberta v. Alberta (Attorney General)</em>,
    [1992] 1 S.C.R. 901, at p. 943, per Sopinka J., in dissent; <em>Chiang (Re)</em>,

    contempt if the contemnor subsequently complies with the order or otherwise
    purges his or her contempt or, in exceptional circumstances, where new facts or
    evidence have come to light after the contempt finding was made: <em>Carey</em>,

    have consistently discouraged its routine use to obtain compliance with court
    orders. It should be used cautiously and with great restraint; it is regarded
    as an enforcement power of last, not first, resort. So, where an alleged
    contemnor acted in good faith in taking reasonable steps to comply with the
    order, the judge entertaining a contempt motion generally retains some
    discretion to decline to make a finding of contempt. As well, a judge may
    properly exercise his or her discretion to decline to impose a contempt finding

    understood the Order. On his examination, Mr. Renzo Belluz, a principal of NEC
    and a practising planning lawyer, acknowledged that he had read the Order and
    understood what it required NEC to do. Further, the evidence clearly shows that
    NEC retained MPlan to prepare and file the report on its behalf. As a result,
    the filing of the MPlan Report with the Town certainly was an intentional act
    by NEC. As acknowledged in MPlan’s filing letter of December 6, 2019, the MPlan
    Report served “as NEC’s input” to the Consent Application, as well as a review

    conduct by NEC other than the filing of the MPlan Report that it alleges
    disrupted the Consent Application process, such as delays by NEC in responding
    to communications by McDonald’s and NEC’s refusal to comply with simple
    requests from McDonald’s and the Town. Apart from the fact that McDonald’s did
    not plead in its notice of motion that such conduct amounted to acts of
    contempt, in my view the conduct did not materially affect the prosecution of
    the Consent Application. Notwithstanding McDonald’s own delay of close to 10
    months in prosecuting the Consent Application, the reality was that by early
    November 2019 Town staff had advised McDonald’s that they were prepared to move
    forward with the Consent Application, which had been placed in the priority
    queue for circulation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, on its part NEC asserts, by way of a
    defence to the contempt motion, that no Lease existed after March 2018, following
    the expiry of 21 years from the commencement of the Lease, with the result that
    the contempt motion is moot. However, as of December 6, 2019, when NEC filed
    the MPlan Report, the Consent Application was very much alive and before the
    Town’s Committee of Adjustment for consideration. The MPlan Report, which
    purported to provide the Committee of Adjustment with NEC’s “input” on the
    Consent Application, did not take the position that the Lease was at an end and
    therefore the Committee of Adjustment should or could not consider the Consent
    Application. Instead, NEC took the position that the Consent Application could
    be supported, subject to conditions set out in the MPlan Report. Given that
    position, I do not consider it necessary to determine what appears to be a defence
    constructed after-the-fact in response to the contempt motion and which is
    inconsistent with the position NEC took in the MPlan Report.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the balance of these reasons will
    focus on what I regard as the determinative issue, namely: whether NEC’s filing
    of the MPlan Report was a breach of para. 3(b) of the Order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I will proceed with some caution. Although
    consideration of the Consent Application by the Committee of Adjustment has
    been deferred, the application remains alive. Consequently, I will decide the
    contempt motion but in a manner that recognizes the future conduct of the
    Consent Application lies within the jurisdiction of the Committee of Adjustment.</span></p>

    McDonald’s.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> McDonald’s contends that by retaining MPlan to

    the Order.</span></p>

    Adjustment as to how the Consent Application could be approved.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 19.10 of the Lease stipulates that it is
    subject to the <em>Planning Act</em>. In considering the Consent Application,
    the Committee of Adjustment will consider the renewal of the Lease in the
    context of the various public planning instruments and policies in effect. Town
    staff pointed this out to McDonald’s in its March 21, 2018 communication that
    requested McDonald’s to file a concept plan, together with a Planning Justification
    Report.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Some 17 months after the Town had made its
    request, McDonald’s sought to satisfy it by filing the IBI Report. McDonald’s
    did not provide NEC with the report for review before submitting it; NEC
    received a copy of the report the day before its filing. The IBI Report went
    into great detail about the implications of the renewal of the Lease for
    planning policies contained in instruments issued by various levels of
    government. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Three aspects of the IBI Report are of
    particular relevance to the contempt motion:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>(i)      The Consent Application signed by NEC’s representative
    referred simply to a consent for “a long term lease for a McDonald’s
    Restaurant”. The February 1, 2018 covering letter from Dentons indicated that <em>Planning
    Act</em> approval was sought for the two ten-year options to extend under the
    Lease. The IBI Report indicated that consent was being sought for the two
    renewal periods. The IBI Report did not disclose that the Order only renewed
    the Lease for the first 10-year renewal term;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>(ii)     The IBI Report included a sketch, Figure 4-1, that outlined
    in red the demised premises that are subject to the proposed extension of the
    Lease. The report states that “the proposed extension of the existing lease
    area would occupy approximately 7% of the total site area, and does not include
    vehicular or pedestrian access points to external roads. The area covers the
    existing McDonald’s restaurant building, immediately adjacent walkway and
    landscape areas, the existing drive through lane, a small portion of the
    westerly internal drive aisle, and two accessible parking spaces.” This point
    is repeated in the report’s conclusion, which states that “[t]he spatial extent
    of the lease is based on existing and approved development on the subject
    lands, which permits the stand-alone McDonald’s restaurant”; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>(iii)     The IBI Report emphasized in several places that <a
name="_Hlk66199899">the Consent Application and the Lease would not prevent
    growth and development from occurring on the NEC Property</a>. For example, s.
    5.1.1. of the IBI Report stated that “[t]he area of the lands not subject to
    the proposed extension of the existing lease provides sufficient space and
    frontage for phased or complete development/re-development in the future, should
    that occur.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On its face, the filing of the MPlan Report was
    NEC’s attempt to draw to the Committee of Adjustment’s attention certain
    aspects of the Consent Application that it thought affected its interest as
    owner of the Property, of which the demised premises formed only a small part.
    The MPlan Report stated that it intended to provide NEC’s “input” to the
    Consent Application, comment on the IBI Report, and respond to requests by Town
    staff that it confirm it was aware of and supported the Consent Application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Committee of Adjustment has not denied the
    Consent Application; it has deferred considering the application until the
    parties provide it with requested clarification.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That is the context in which McDonald’s allegation
    that NEC has breached the Order’s requirement that NEC provide “all reasonable
    cooperation” must be assessed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I shall now consider McDonald’s allegation that by
    filing the MPlan Report NEC breached para. 3(b) of the Order.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>First allegation: The MPlan Report opposed
    the Consent Application</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>McDonald’s alleges that the MPlan Report is
    explicitly contrary to the Consent Application because it does not support the
    application. I am not persuaded by that submission. A plain reading of the
    MPlan Report reveals that it supports a consent application, a point
    acknowledged on cross-examination by Mr. Crough from IBI. However, the MPlan Report
    proposed three conditions of approval. As I will explain in the next few
    paragraphs, I conclude that NEC had a legitimate interest in proposing the
    conditions of approval and by doing so did not breach its obligation to provide
    “all reasonable cooperation.”</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-CA>Second allegation: The MPlan Report improperly proposed a temporal
    limit on the consent</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>McDonald’s next alleges that the MPlan Report is
    explicitly contrary to the Consent Application because it proposed that consent
    approval be limited to the initial 10-year renewal period, not to the two
    10-year lease renewal options contained in the Lease. While it is true that
    NEC’s proposal to limit consent approval is inconsistent with McDonald’s
    application to obtain approval for the two renewal periods, NEC’s proposal does
    not amount to a breach of para. 3(b) of the Order. Since the Order only
    declared that the Lease had been renewed for the first 10-year renewal term,
    NEC’s obligation to provide reasonable co-operation under para. 3(b) of the
    Order only extended to an application that sought approval for the first renewal
    period sanctioned by this court. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-CA>Third allegation: The MPlan Report improperly proposed a
    geographical limit on the consent</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>McDonald’s alleges that the MPlan Report is
    explicitly contrary to the Consent Application by proposing that any consent
    provided “be geographically limited in a manner that conflicts with McDonald’s
    rights under the Lease.” This allegation has two parts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first part of the allegation asserts that one
    condition of approval proposed by the MPlan Report would modify the area to
    which any consent would apply to ensure that NEC could redevelop the rest of
    the Property in accordance with applicable planning intensification policies
    and plans. It is true that the MPlan Report proposed such a modification, but the
    modification was more spatially favourable to McDonald’s than that contained in
    the IBI Report and was consistent with the extent of the demised premises under
    the Lease.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Over the years, the Lease had undergone several
    amendments that expanded the size of the demised premises, in large part to
    enable McDonald’s to expand the restaurant’s drive-through. Under the Lease,
    the demised premises were L-shaped. The IBI Report proposed, in Figure 4-1, that
    the lands for which consent be given track the L-shape of the demised premises. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The MPlan Report proposed that consent approval
    be given to a larger, rectangular area of the Property that would include the
    L-shaped demised premises, together with additional parts of the Property. The
    MPlan Report contended that the larger, more regular shape of the area, to
    which consent approval should apply, would facilitate the orderly development
    of the balance of the NEC Property. To be clear, NEC was not proposing that
    consent approval be given to an area smaller than the demised premises under
    the Lease. Quite the opposite. NEC proposed that consent approval be given to
    an area larger than the demised premises. In those circumstances, I am not
    persuaded that such a proposal amounted to a failure to provide “all reasonable
    cooperation” required by para. 3(b) of the Order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second part of the allegation asserts that NEC’s
    proposal that consent approval should not apply to the No Build Zone provisions
    of the Lease was contrary to the Consent Application and a breach of the Order.
    Article XXII of the Lease deals with common areas. Sections 22.01 to 22.04 of
    the Lease allow McDonald’s, and its customers, the right to use the parking
    areas and other outdoor common areas of the shopping plaza and prohibit NEC
    from building on any part of the common areas shown with hatch marks on
    Schedule “E-4” to the Lease. The hatched area constitutes a significant portion
    of NEC’s Property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The MPlan Report proposed that consent approval
    not apply to the No Build Zone Lease provisions as those provisions “sterilize
    the NEC property and therefore do not meet the Planning Act requirements
    referred to above. The condition is intended to ensure that consent to the 1<sup>st</sup> renewal term does not freeze development on the retained lands and removes any
    restriction that would otherwise prevent development from occurring in a phases,
    with the south west corner of the property potentially be redeveloped last” [<em>sic</em>].</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>McDonald’s alleges that this proposal in the
    MPlan Report is contrary to the Consent Application. I am not persuaded that it
    is. First, the Consent Application, the Denton’s covering letter, and the IBI
    Report did not make any mention of the Lease’s No Build Zone provisions. It is
    difficult to see how the MPlan Report’s proposal could be inconsistent with a
    matter that was not disclosed by McDonald’s in its Consent Application. Indeed,
    it is not clear from the record why the IBI Report failed to address the
    implications of the Consent Application for the Lease’s No Build Zone provisions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, the MPlan Report’s proposal is
    consistent with the numerous representations made by the IBI Report that approval
    of the Consent Application would not prevent growth and development from
    occurring on the rest of the Property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the Lease’s renewal terms are subject
    to the <em>Planning Act</em>. McDonald’s is not entitled as of right to consent
    approval under s. 50(3)(f) of the <em>Planning Act</em>. McDonald’s must
    demonstrate to the Committee of Adjustment that the consent it seeks is
    consistent with the planning principles relevant to the granting of such
    consent. Within two months of the filing of the Consent Application, Town staff
    clearly signalled the need for McDonald’s to provide a concept plan and
    planning justification, which in part would address the impact of any consent
    approval on the future development of the remainder of the Property.  NEC had a
    legitimate interest in ensuring that the Committee of Adjustment was aware of
    provisions of the Lease, such as the No Build Zone provisions, that could
    impact such future development.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, I conclude that the three
    conditions of approval proposed in the MPlan Report reflected legitimate
    concerns of NEC, as owner of the remainder of the Property, about relevant
    issues that McDonald’s had not identified in its Consent Application. On their
    face the proposed conditions were not designed to defeat the Consent
    Application, but to support the granting of consent approval that took into
    account NEC’s legitimate concerns. As a result, I do not see the content of the
    MPlan Report, including its proposed conditions of approval, as constituting a
    breach by NEC of its obligation to provide “all reasonable cooperation” under
    the Order.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Fourth allegation: The mere filing of the
    MPlan Report breached the Order</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>McDonald’s advances one final argument. It
    contends that the mere filing of the MPlan Report constituted an act of
    contempt because it resulted in the Committee of Adjustment deferring
    consideration of the Consent Application. I am not persuaded by this
    submission. Para. 3(b) of the Order did not sanction a process in which
    McDonald’s was permitted to proceed with its Consent Application on a kind of <em>ex
    parte</em> basis, with no ability for the landowner, NEC, to raise legitimate planning
    issues or point out inaccuracies in McDonald’s application. The evidence
    discloses that at various points NEC sought to provide some input into the
    application but was rebuffed by McDonald’s. In those circumstances, it is
    understandable that NEC would want to place before the Committee of Adjustment
    information it thought relevant to a complete consideration of the Consent Application
    and its approval on a basis that was fair to the legitimate interests of both
    tenant and landlord. In the circumstances, I do not regard NEC’s filing of the
    MPlan Report as a breach of para. 3(b) of the Order.</span></p>
