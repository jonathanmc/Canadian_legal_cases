  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Rouleau J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of fraud over $5000
    for being party to a scheme that defrauded an elderly man of approximately
    $150,000. It was not disputed at trial that the fraud occurred. The principal
    issue was whether the Crown could prove the appellant’s involvement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s case depended on evidence obtained
    from the United Parcel Service (“UPS”) and various financial institutions
    pursuant to production orders issued under s. 487.014 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, as well as additional evidence collected without judicial
    authorization after the production orders had been executed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant brought a pretrial application
    before Sloan J. to have some of the information acquired by the police excluded
    from trial as having been collected in violation of his rights under s. 8 <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>of the </span></em><em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.
    He argued that information obtained in violation of s. 8 had been included in
    the information to obtain (“ITO”) the production orders and should be excised. Once
    that information was removed, the production orders could not have issued and
    the resulting evidence was inadmissible at trial. He also maintained that some
    of the additional information collected by police after the production orders
    should be excluded from trial, as it was obtained in violation of s. 8. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In a decision dated August 2, 2018, with reasons
    reported at 2018 ONSC 4704, the application judge excised some portions of the
    ITO but left most of the impugned paragraphs intact. With the exception of the
    excised portions, he held that investigators had not breached the appellant’s
    s. 8 <em>Charter</em> rights in collecting the information. The application
    judge then found that the edited ITO still made out reasonable grounds upon
    which the production orders could have issued. Consequently, all of the
    evidence obtained pursuant to the production orders was admissible at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the application judge concluded that,
    even if he had found a <em>Charter </em>violation, the breach was minor and he
    would not have excluded any evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals his conviction on the
    basis that the application judge erred in failing to exclude the evidence from
    trial. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>FACTS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the fall of 2014, the complainant received a
    letter advising him that he had won $3.6 million in the lottery. He was
    instructed by an unknown individual to send bank drafts and certified cheques
    payable to “Kadeen Fletcher” or “Expetech” in order to pay certain “fees”. He believed
    that the payments were necessary to claim his lottery winnings. As per the instructions
    he received, he sent everything through UPS, addressed either to the UPS store
    at 14-30 Eglinton Avenue West, Toronto, or to 465 Apache Court, Mississauga. In
    total, the complainant was defrauded of CAD$111,400 and US$36,000.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant’s daughter eventually convinced
    him to report the matter to police. Detective Constable Daniel Cimermancic (the
    “investigator”) was assigned to lead the investigation into the complaint.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant provided the investigator with a
    substantial amount of evidence, including copies of bank drafts and certified
    cheques, bank records, receipts, and tracking information for the UPS packages.
    Armed with the requisite dates, payee names, and UPS tracking information, the
    investigator gathered additional information from UPS and other businesses
    through which the complainant’s financial instruments passed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In May 2016, the investigator learned from a UPS
    representative that certain cheques to be delivered to 465 Apache Court were in
    fact delivered to 65-455 Apache Court. The investigator determined, based on a
    Google search, that the address 465 Apache Court did not exist and that 455
    Apache Court was a large complex occupying all the odd-numbered addresses on
    the street. The investigator also learned that an individual had signed for one
    of the packages as “Kadeem”. The investigator did not have a warrant or
    production order to obtain this information from UPS.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The investigator next spoke with Peel Regional
    Police and learned that both the name “Kadeem Fletcher” and the address 65-455
    Apache Court were associated with a person named “Freddy Mawick” who had
    previously been charged with defrauding the public. The investigator checked
    Canadian Police Information Centre (“CPIC”) records and determined that a
    person with the appellant’s name had been convicted of money laundering in
    British Columbia in 2007 and 2009, and faced various outstanding charges for
    fraud, counterfeit, and forgery in Ontario. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On July 20, 2016 the investigator made inquiries
    with TD bank to trace the accounts into which certain bank drafts had been
    deposited. The investigator noticed that one of the cheques had the name
    “Mawik” inscribed on the back.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The following day, July 21, the investigator
    spoke with a representative of GTA Financial and Investment Corp., where five
    cheques had been cashed. The representative informed the investigator that the
    appellant had cashed five cheques made out to Kadeen Fletcher. The
    representative also informed the investigator that GTA Financial held certain
    account records, including a copy of the appellant’s driver’s licence, which
    could be made available under a production order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Also on July 21, 2016 the investigator spoke
    with a representative of Buduchnist Credit Union after learning that Buduchnist
    had endorsed a bank draft sent by the complainant. The Buduchnist
    representative informed the investigator that Buduchnist acted only as a
    clearing agency, receiving cheques and other instruments from a group of
    undisclosed clients, including the money service business that had initially
    cashed the cheque. The investigator asked for the identity of the money service
    business. The Buduchnist representative responded that its client wished to
    consult counsel before revealing any additional information.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Shortly after his conversation with Buduchnist, the
    investigator received a voicemail message from a lawyer calling on behalf of
    her client, a money service business called Cash House. The investigator
    deduced that this must be Buduchnist’s undisclosed money service client. The
    lawyer stated that Cash House would not speak to police unless a production
    order could be obtained.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following his conversations with the
    representatives of GTA Financial, Buduchnist Credit Union and Cash House, the
    investigator filed an ITO seeking production orders directed at six financial
    institutions, including GTA Financial and Cash House. The ITO included an
    affidavit setting out the information the investigator had collected from UPS,
    GTA Financial, Buduchnist, and Cash House, among other sources. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The production orders issued on August 17, 2016.
    In response, GTA Financial produced a copy of the appellant’s driver’s licence,
    a “Master Business Licence” for a company named “Kadeem-Fletcher” whose
    principal was the appellant, and copies of the complainant’s certified cheques.
    Cash House did not produce identity documents for the appellant, but rather a
    passport, social insurance number, and birth certificate for an individual
    named Osea Kadeem Fletcher.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 26, 2016, roughly two months after
    filing the ITO, the investigator made further inquiries with Suhaid Azim, the
    owner of the UPS store at 14-30 Eglinton, and Boris Golan, the operator of a
    Money Market at which two bank drafts had been cashed. He asked Mr. Azim
    whether individuals named Freddy Mawick, Freddy Kashit or Kadeem Fletcher had
    records at the UPS store. Mr. Azim confirmed that all three names were linked
    to a single record under the name Kadeem Fletcher. Mr. Azim showed the records
    to the investigator on a computer monitor, including the client’s customer
    profile, transaction history, and receipts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 4, 2016 the investigator arrested
    Boris Golan as a suspected co-conspirator in the fraud. In an interview, Mr.&nbsp;Golan
    told the investigator that Money Market used Cash House as a clearing service,
    and that he had previously served an individual named “Freddy</span>”<span
lang=EN-CA>. However, Mr. Golan was unconditionally released when police
    determined that he had no knowledge of the fraudulent bank drafts. After his
    release, Mr. Golan voluntarily provided the investigator with identity
    documents he kept on file for Osea Kadeem Fletcher. The documents matched those
    produced by Cash House under the production order. Mr. Golan also produced Fletcher’s
    phone number, which was the same as the appellant’s.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nearly one year later, on September 20, 2017 the
    investigator again visited Suhaid Azim at the Eglinton UPS store to obtain
    printed copies of the customer profile he had been shown in October 2016. The
    investigator then contacted the prior owner of the Eglinton UPS store, Andrew
    Ang, and learned that the appellant had arranged to use the UPS store as a
    forwarding address in 2013. There, the appellant received packages addressed
    variously to “Freddy Mawick”, “Freddy Kashit” or “Kadeem Fletcher”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was indicted for fraud on March 1,
    2018. A 12-day trial was held in January 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The main issue at trial was the identity of the
    individual who had cashed the cheques and bank drafts sent by the complainant.
    The information collected from UPS, Cash House, Money Market, Buduchnist, GTA
    Financial and other financial institutions pursuant to production orders was
    central to tying the appellant to the fraud.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s defence depended on his
    application under ss. 8 and 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em> to exclude both the
    information provided by the various businesses without a production order and
    the evidence obtained pursuant to the production orders. The appellant argued
    that once the information obtained in violation of s. 8 was excised from the ITO,
    the GTA Financial and Cash House production orders could not have issued. The
    principal information he sought to excise from the ITO can be summarized as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Multiple financial institutions confirmed that
    fraudulently obtained funds were negotiated through accounts held by the
    appellant or cashed by the appellant (para. 7);</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to UPS, two TD certified cheques
    addressed to Kadeen Fletcher at 465 Apache Court were actually delivered to
    65-455 Apache Court. One was signed for by a recipient named “Kadeem” (para.
    26);</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Five TD certified cheques were negotiated

    information held by GTA Financial and that the warrantless collection of that

    subparagraphs of para. 39 which disclosed that a person named Mawick had cashed
    five certified cheques at GTA Financial; that he was the only person who cashed
    cheques at GTA Financial in the name of Kadeen Fletcher; and that “Mawick’s”

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On May 10 and 11,
    2016, I contacted UPS customer service to confirm delivery details regarding
    [the complainant’s] shipments. I learned the following:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>a. Two shipments
    dated December 30, 2014 (TD certified cheque for $23,200 and January 21, 2015
    (TD certified cheque for $11,500), addressed to Kadeen FLETCHER at 465 Apache,
    were actually delivered to 65-455 Apache Court, Mississauga, Ontario. The
    former shipment was delivered on December 31, 2014 at 9:40 AM, and signed by
    the recipient as “Kadeem”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant maintains that he had a reasonable
    expectation of privacy in UPS’s business records and, in particular, the
    information as to where deliveries were sent and who signed for them. He argues
    that the investigator did not get the name “Kadeem” or the address “65-455
    Apache Court” from the complainant, but rather from UPS. Because that
    information was obtained from UPS without a warrant, its collection violated
    the appellant’s s. 8 rights, and para. 26 of the ITO, which is based on that
    information, ought to have been excised. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I disagree. The complainant used UPS because he
    was instructed to do so by the appellant or one of his co-conspirators. He was told
    to take note of the tracking numbers, which he later gave to police. The
    appellant or a co-conspirator also instructed the complainant to make the
    cheques out to Kadeen Fletcher and to address the packages to 465 Apache Court.
    The evidence is that anyone with the tracking numbers could access the UPS
    website or call its customer service line, track the deliveries to their final destinations,
    and learn the name of the person who signed for each delivery. Indeed, the
    investigator testified at trial that the tracking numbers permitted him to make
    inquiries both online and with customer service representatives at UPS in
    respect of individual deliveries. It was during one of these conversations that
    a UPS representative informed him that certain packages addressed to 465 Apache
    Court had been delivered to 65-455 Apache Court, and that at least one
    recipient had signed as “Kadeem”. All of the information obtained from UPS,
    whether through the company’s website or in conversation with customer service
    representatives, was obtainable with the complainant’s tracking numbers. </span></p>

    relationship between the appellant and UPS was simply that of a customer
    obtaining a service offered by UPS in the ordinary and routine business sense. In
    these circumstances, there is no basis for finding that the police violated the
    appellant's s.8 rights by accessing that readily available information. Any
    expectation of privacy the appellant may have had in his home address or the
    name “Kadeem” was waived by directing the complainant to use UPS and its tracking
    system to make deliveries to that name at that address. The application judge
    did not err when he refused to excise para. 26 of the ITO, nor when he admitted
    the information obtained from UPS for use at trial. </span></p>

    v. The Queen</em>, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 29, the term “in respect of”, which I would
    liken to the word “respecting”, is “probably the widest of any expression
    intended to convey some connection between two related subject matters”: at p.
    39. In <em>R. v. P.W.</em>, this court explained, albeit in the context of a
    search warrant, that the ITO need only provide grounds for believing that the
    record holder has documents or data “relevant or rationally connected to the
    incident under investigation, the parties involved, and their potential
    culpability”: at para. 30, citing <em>CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</em>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 743, at para. 15. Put simply, there

    the commission of the offence. At para. 42 of the ITO, the investigator
    indicates that he first contacted Buduchnist Credit Union to discuss bank
    drafts bearing Buduchnist stamps. He learned that Buduchnist acted as a clearing
    agency for other undisclosed money service clients. The ITO indicates that the
    investigator spoke with Cash House “as a result” of his contact with Buduchnist
    and that the production order would produce information related to two bank
    drafts which were “presumably cashed” at Cash House.</span></p>

    investigator concluded that Cash House was Buduchnist’s undisclosed money
    service client, the inference that it was a result of what he learned from
    Buduchnist is reasonably available. While the investigator could have more
    clearly articulated the basis for his inference that documents in the
    possession of Cash House would afford evidence respecting the commission of the
    offence, it was open to the issuing justice, as well as the application judge,
    to conclude that the investigator had reasonable grounds for his belief. Given
    the presumption of validity of production orders and the deference owed to the
    application judge, I see no basis to interfere. It follows that the evidence
    obtained pursuant to the Cash House production order was properly admitted.</span></p>

    House produced documentation about an individual named Osea Kadeem Fletcher
    rather than the appellant. In response, the appellant argues that, on the
    investigator’s theory of the case at the time, Kadeem Fletcher and the
    appellant were the same person. If the police believed that “Fletcher” was the
    appellant’s alias, then they should have treated “Fletcher” accounts with the
    same respect for the appellant’s privacy as they would an account under the
    name “Mawick”. In this sense, the appellant seeks to rely on the police’s
    working theory of the case in a manner similar to the appellant’s arguments in <em>R.
    v. Jones</em>, 2017 SCC 60, 2 S.C.R. 696. </span></p>

    Labelle</em>, 2019 ONCA 557, 379 C.C.C. (3d) 270, at para. 31, <em>Jones</em> permits the appellant to rely on the Crown’s theory of the case to “establish certain
    facts relevant to [the] s. 8 claim”. For instance, the appellant might use the
    Crown’s theory to argue that the Fletcher account should be treated as his own
    for the purposes of the analysis. However, the Crown’s theory alone is not
    sufficient to gain standing: “[t]he trial judge is still required to assess
    those facts in the ‘totality of the circumstances’ to determine whether the
    accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy”. In this case, the appellant
    provided no evidence addressing his subjective expectation of privacy in the
    Cash House documents, nor the objective reasonableness of that expectation. The
    appellant simply has not met his burden on the s. 8 application. </span></p>

    Market following the brief arrest and release of its operator, Mr. Golan, were

lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that after finding that he
    had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his financial affairs, the application
    judge erred by admitting into evidence the financial information collected by
    the investigator. The appellant points in particular to the information
    obtained from GTA Financial indicating that the appellant had an account and
    that a copy of his driver’s licence was on record. This information was struck
    from the ITO as a violation of the appellant’s s. 8 rights, but it was
    nonetheless admitted at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.
    Other than the information properly obtained pursuant to the production orders,
    the information collected by the investigator was either information over which
    the appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy, as I have described, or
    it was financial information provided to the investigator by the complainant.
    The complainant’s information, which included cancelled cheques, bank drafts
    and UPS information, disclosed the identity of certain payees and banks that
    negotiated the instruments. That information was part of the fraud, and it was
    revealed to the complainant in the course of the fraud. As the application
    judge explained, this was the appellant’s “trail of breadcrumbs”. No judicial
    authorization was required for its collection by the investigator.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also see no error in the application judge’s
    approach to the information obtained from GTA Financial. The application judge
    determined that the investigator’s initial contact with representatives of GTA
    Financial breached the appellant’s s. 8 rights, and he duly excised the
    resulting information from the ITO. That was the correct remedy: <em>R. v.
    Grant</em>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223. The application judge then found that the
    production order was properly issued after the improperly obtained facts were
    excised. Consequently, the evidence obtained pursuant to the production order,
    which included some of the information previously excised from the ITO, was
    properly admitted at trial. This is not a case of the sort considered in <em>Grant</em> or, more recently, <em>R. v. Côté,</em> 2011 SCC 46, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 215, in
    which an initial warrantless search taints a subsequent warranted search. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge found that if there had
    been any breaches of s. 8, they were minor and the information should
    nonetheless be admitted into evidence. The appellant argues that the application
    judge erred in so finding. He submits that the entirety of the investigation as
    it related to the appellant was the direct result of repeated <em>Charter</em>-infringing
    conduct. The seriousness of the breaches and their central role in the
    investigation and conviction of the appellant highly favour exclusion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I disagree. Although I have concluded that none
    of the s. 8 breaches alleged on appeal are made out, I agree with the application
    judge’s s. 24(2) analysis and his conclusion that, even if there were breaches
    of the appellant’s s. 8 rights, they were minor, and the evidence ought not to
    be excluded.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The information derived from UPS tracking
    numbers was obtained or obtainable by the complainant based on information
    provided by the appellant. The information obtained from the financial
    institutions was obtained pursuant to production orders which, as discussed,
    were validly issued. Even accepting that there was a reasonable expectation of
    privacy in some of the information obtained by the investigator without
    authorization, all of that information was either properly obtained from other
    sources, or it was information that was in any event discoverable. In short,
    the <em>Charter</em>-infringing conduct – if there was any – was not serious
    and its impact on the appellant’s privacy interest was slight.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By contrast, society’s interest in having the
    case adjudicated on its merits is strong in light of the seriousness of the
    fraud. The documents that the appellant seeks to exclude were central to the
    case, and the evidence collected by DC Cimermancic in the course of his
    investigation is reliable. As a result, I agree with the application judge’s determination
    that exclusion would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute
    and that, if there was a breach, the information ought nonetheless to be
    admitted. The application judge’s findings and conclusions are owed deference
    on appeal and I see no basis to interfere.</span></p>
