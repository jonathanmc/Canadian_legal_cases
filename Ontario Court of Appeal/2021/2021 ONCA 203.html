  <p class=Heading>By the Court:</p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>This is an appeal by the
    National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (“NCTR”) of the order regarding
    the disposition of proposed statistical reports and records arising out of the
    Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (“IRSSA”) and the Independent
    Assessment Process (“IAP”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>This appeal is about
    competing privacy and archival interests involving the preservation and control
    of historical documents and data that relate to the intensely personal and
    confidential accounts of the survivors of the abuse that occurred at Canada’s
    Indian Residential Schools. It concerns the myriad administrative records and
    other materials arising out of the settlement and adjudication of the Indian
    Residential School survivor claims pursuant to the historic IRSSA. The national
    tragedy of the Indian Residential Schools is well documented. The documentation
    of these claims was essential to the successful operation of the IAP that was
    established under the IRSSA. This documentation also served to advance the
    integral purposes of truth and reconciliation through the creation of the NCTR,
    a unique Indigenous historical archive.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>The IAP records and
    documents have been the subject of several court proceedings. This appeal
    concerns the disposition of certain documents and the use of data (“Records”)
    related to the administration of the IAP by the Indian Residential Schools
    Adjudication Secretariat (the “Secretariat”) under the direction of the Chief
    Adjudicator. These Records pertain to the operation, management, and oversight
    of the IAP. Through the IAP, thousands of Indian Residential School survivor
    claims were adjudicated and resolved pursuant to the IRSSA that was
    court-approved in late 2006 and early 2007.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>The Chief Adjudicator
    brought a Request for Directions (“RFD”) before the Supervising Judge of the
    Ontario Superior Court of Justice (“Supervising Judge”) with respect to two
    classes of Records: (a) proposed statistical reports; and (b) Non-Claim
    Records. The Supervising Judge is tasked with administering the IRSSA in Ontario.
    In this RFD, the Chief Adjudicator proposed to generate new statistical
    reports, titled “Final Outcome Statistical Reports” and referred to as “Static
    Reports” (the “proposed Static Reports”), about the IAP using confidential
    claims data. If these proposed Static Reports were approved, the Chief
    Adjudicator intended to include them in his IAP Final Report. The Chief
    Adjudicator also sought permission to transfer the proposed Static Reports and
    some of the Non-Claim Records for archiving to the appellant, the NCTR, which
    is an emanation of the IRSSA and not a party to the IRSSA.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>At issue before the
    Supervising Judge was the risk of disclosure of IAP confidential information,
    as well as the reliability and archival importance of some of the statistical
    data and administrative documents sought to be produced and archived. The
    Supervising Judge’s predominant concern was to preserve the confidentiality of
    all information and documentation related to the claims and identities of the
    Indian Residential School survivors. With respect to the proposed Static
    Reports, if they could be produced in a form that ensured confidentiality,
    reliability, and archival validity, they would no doubt be of historical and
    archival importance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>The Supervising Judge dismissed
    the Chief Adjudicator’s RFD and declined to fully implement his proposal,
    including the preparation of the proposed Static Reports. Instead, the
    Supervising Judge directed the respondent, the Attorney General of Canada
    (“Canada”), to submit a new proposal for the archiving of copies of the
    Non-Claim Records with the NCTR, subject to certain inclusions and exclusions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>The NCTR submits that the
    Supervising Judge erred in dismissing the Chief Adjudicator’s RFD. Canada
    maintains that the Supervising Judge made no error and that the appeal should
    be dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>For the reasons that follow,
    we agree that the Supervising Judge erred in his treatment of the proposed
    Static Reports, and we therefore remit this issue for a rehearing before the Supervising
    Judge. We dismiss the appeal as it pertains to the Non-Claim Records.</span></p>

    Schools in Canada and who were living as of May 30, 2005: <em>Baxter v. Canada

    more than 150,000 Indigenous children were placed in the Indian Residential
    Schools funded by Canada and operated by various religious organizations. Here,
    the children suffered the appalling abuse that gave rise to the IRSSA. The
    IRSSA represents the culmination of negotiations to address the historical and
    ongoing damaging legacy of Canada’s Indian Residential Schools system. Notably,
    the Preamble to the IRSSA provides that its goals are to achieve a “fair,
    comprehensive and lasting resolution of the legacy of Indian Residential
    Schools” through the “promotion of healing, education, truth and reconciliation
    and commemoration”.</span></p>

    January 2007, nine courts across Canada (the “supervising courts”) approved the
    IRSSA and issued substantially identical Approval Orders. In March 2007, the
    supervising courts also issued identical Implementation Orders. As set out by
    the Supervising Judge, at para. 13 of his reasons, the judgments and orders of
    the supervising courts provide that the supervising courts “shall supervise the
    implementation of the IRSSA and that the </span><span lang=EN-US

    combines all the outstanding litigation into one class action. Over 38,000
    claims have been processed and resolved, and over $3 billion has been disbursed
    to IAP claimants. The IRSSA provides for financial compensation to the
    survivors of the Indian Residential Schools, and it addresses the need for the
    archiving of documents to advance truth-telling and reconciliation and

    November 2004 report entitled “Report on Canada’s Dispute Resolution Plan to
    Compensate for Abuses in Indian Residential Schools”, truth-telling, healing,
    and public education are also required. The AFN’s recommendation for the

    Supreme Court upheld the Supervising Judge’s decision that all Claim Records
    must be destroyed following a 15-year retention period to protect the privacy
    and confidentiality rights of the claimants. During this period, individual IAP
    claimants may elect to have their own Claim Records preserved and archived

    affidavit of Nicole Hansen, the Acting Manager of the Business Process
    Management and Reporting Unit of the Secretariat and Supervisor of Statistical
    Operations, at para. 24, the rationale behind the production of the proposed

lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>We start our analysis with
    the issues that are not in dispute on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>First, the proposed Static
    Reports are meant to contain aggregated statistical data about IAP claimants
    that would serve to provide a better understanding of the claims process and
    the scale and scope of abuse at the Indian Residential Schools. As such, as long
    as the confidentiality of the IAP data is preserved, the IRSSA does not explicitly
    preclude the generation of the proposed Static Reports.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Second, there is nothing in
    the IRSSA to circumscribe the Chief Adjudicator’s exercise of his discretion in
    fulfilling his responsibility to report on the process and explain the findings
    of the IAP, except for the overarching concerns of maintaining the privacy of
    the individuals involved in the IAP and of advancing the goals of truth and
    reconciliation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Third, concerns about the
    disclosure of the proposed Static Reports must be remitted to the Supervising
    Judge. The Supervising Judge has the power to direct the handling of the IAP
    documents: <em>Fontaine (SCC)</em>, at para. 31. This includes determining
    whether the proposed Static Reports should be generated and archived. No party
    or non-party may unilaterally direct the production of any IAP document,
    including the proposed Static Reports. Approval of any such production must be
    sought from the Supervising Judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Fourth, the Supervising Judge
    is required to protect the confidentiality of the IAP claimants’ private
    information. There is no dispute that if there were a risk that the proposed
    Static Reports revealed confidential claimant data, they should not be produced,
    as this would violate the order in <em>Fontaine (SCC)</em>. Given that the
    information in the proposed Static Reports would be based on the confidential
    information contained in the SADRE database, protection of the IAP claimants’
    rights to confidentiality must be maintained. Following <em>Fontaine (SCC)</em>,
    the safeguarding of the IAP claimants’ privacy rights properly served as the
    main lens through which the Supervising Judge assessed the Chief Adjudicator’s
    proposal regarding the proposed Static Reports.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Fifth, no issue is taken
    with the principles the Supervising Judge used to consider the reliability and
    archival utility of the proposed Static Reports. His reasons demonstrate that
    he was attuned to the four foundational principles for archives espoused by Dr.
    Peterson: authenticity; reliability; integrity; and usability.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Sixth, there was no dispute
    that, like the existing statistical reports, the production of the proposed
    Static Reports could be of historical and archival significance, provided they are
    generated in a form that protects the claimants’&nbsp;rights to the
    confidentiality of their IAP information, and that the data are produced in a
    reliable manner that is consistent with the principles of archival validity and
    utility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Indeed, the Supervising
    Judge’s approval of the existing statistical reports is unchallenged on appeal.
    As the Supervising Judge recognized by his inclusion of the existing
    statistical reports in the Non-Claim Records collection to be archived at the
    NCTR, the production of statistical reports may be of historical and archival
    significance, so long as these reports do not reveal IAP confidential data. In
    fact, the Supervising Judge, at para. 214 of his reasons, determined that the
    existing statistical reports do not violate the order in <em>Fontaine (SCC)</em>,
    as “they are aggregate or collective information that does not identify
    individual claimants.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>At para. 215 of his reasons,
    the Supervising Judge rejected Canada’s argument that the existing statistical
    reports revealed IAP confidential data because they “are more about the nature
    of the IAP claims in general and the aspects of the IAP that were engaged than
    they are about the characteristics or identities of the Claimants in
    particular.” He was further satisfied, at para. 222 of his reasons, that the
    existing statistical reports “ha</span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>[</span><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black'>d] variables that in the aggregate do not reveal
    information that would be offensive to individuals or to the collective”
    because they “report on the Secretariat’s administration and processing of
    claims, rather than on what the claims process reveals about the history of
    particular residential schools”.</span></p>

    Static Reports are not supported by evidence. Canada disagrees with the NCTR’s
    position.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[H]</span>aving examined the model Static
    Reports, I observe that depending on what specific variables are selected, <u>it
    might be possible by deductive reasoning to disclose the identities of IAP
    Claimants</u> and this would arguably contravene the Orders made in [<em>Fontaine
    (SCC)</em>].</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[D]epending on school size and temporal information, and
    variables based on age, sex, and acts of abuse by province, <u>it might be
    possible to deduce confidential personal information from some of the proposed
    Static Reports</u>. I am especially concerned that this may be possible in the
    case of some small and remote communities, leading to very unfortunate
    consequences.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Information about how many claims were made and how many were
    resolved is statistical information that cannot be manipulated or spun to draw
    unreliable and contentious conclusions. However, the same cannot be said about
    some of the proposed Static Reports, where, for instance, <u>unreliable and
    contentious conclusions might be drawn about acts of student-on-student abuse
    at particular schools</u>. I have reviewed some models of Static Reports and <u>the
    reliability and soundness of the models is doubtful without more information
    from historians, archivists, sociologists, and perhaps other social scientists
    with some expertise in statistical analysis about the proper and appropriate
    use of this statistical evidence[</u>.]</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Lies as much as truths can be told by the manipulation of data.
    There is some considerable truth in the progressive maxim “lies, damned lies,
    and statistics,” and <u>care needs to be taken in making a statistical analysis
    that support[s] observations and conclusions that are debatable and
    contentious. A deeper understanding of the SADRE database might belie any
    conclusions to be drawn from Static Reports</u>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><u>[I] do not see how truth and reconciliation will be advanced
    by reports identifying which school was the worst of the worst or ranking
    schools in the order of which school had more student-on-student sexual
    assaults than staff sexual assaults, etc.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>

    demonstrate, the Supervising Judge expressed considerable concern about the

    evidentiary record before him, it was open to the Supervising Judge to raise
    the issues he did concerning the absence of expert and other evidence that he
    believed precluded him from assessing the reliability and soundness of the
    proposed Static Reports.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>The Chief Adjudicator was
    alive to these issues. As we earlier noted, the lay affidavits before the
    Supervising Judge provided a summary of the possible methodologies that could
    be employed to anonymize data, such as data generalization and data
    suppression, and there was general, uncontroversial evidence about archival
    science and internationally accepted archiving principles.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>However, there was no expert
    or other evidence concerning the level of data generalization or data suppression
    that would be necessary to ensure confidentiality and the reliability and
    soundness of the proposed Static Reports. Notably, Dr. Peterson was not asked
    to provide an opinion on the generation of statistical information, which
    includes the proposed Static Reports.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>It is uncontroversial that
    the risk of disclosure of confidential information increases commensurate with
    the greater level of detail provided. As Professor David H. Flaherty noted at
    para. 74 of his May 2, 2014 affidavit, filed as expert evidence in support of
    the earlier RFD about the Claim Records, while in theory anonymization by
    redaction is possible, “</span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>[i]</span><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black'>n practice, there is now a rich literature on
    how enormously difficult it is to try to anonymize personal information – and
    that the risks of re-identification are very high.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Further, there was no
    conclusive evidence as to what form the proposed Static Reports would definitively
    and ultimately take. The Supervising Judge was provided with models of proposed
    Static Reports, attached as sealed Exhibit “K” to Ms. Hansen’s affidavit.
    However, it was by no means certain that these models would be the final form
    of all the proposed Static Reports to be generated. As Ms.&nbsp;Hansen noted at
    para. 15 of her affidavit, “Statistical Reports can take many forms, depending
    on the available data, the purpose for which the reports will be used, and the
    audience.” Notably, prior proposed Static Reports were modified based on
    feedback from the IAP Oversight Committee members, which include an independent
    chair and eight other members: two former Indian Residential School students;
    two class counsel representatives; two church representatives; and two
    representatives for Canada. Also, when explaining the form of the model
    proposed Static Reports, Ms. Hansen used the words “</span><span lang=EN-US
style='color:black'>[a]t present”, at para. 30 of her affidavit. Such language
    leads to the assumption that the model proposed Static Reports are not in final
    form, as the form itself may be modified in the future.</span></p>

    concerns that there was a lack of expert and other evidence, the Supervising
    Judge erred by concluding, at paras. 220 and 225 of his reasons, that the proposed

    Other than the Supervising Judge’s personal examination of the model proposed
    Static Reports, the Supervising Judge did not refer to any evidence to justify these
    conclusions, and the defects in the evidentiary record that he identified did
    not permit him to reach those determinations.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>First, there was no evidence
    before the Supervising Judge in support of his belief, advanced at para. 221 of

    no concerns about the confidentiality, reliability, or utility of those
    reports. Moreover, he ordered that they be included in the Non-Claim Records
    collection to be archived at the NCTR. During oral submissions, Canada conceded
    that the existing statistical reports are examples of reports where data were
    harvested from the SADRE database and presented “at a very high-level”, in a

    database to be used to produce the proposed Static Reports, “are produced in
    accordance with statistical principles which involve the aggregation of data in

    claimant, alleged perpetrator, or any other affected individual.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>In her affidavit, Ms. Hansen <span class=normaltextrun>explained the various methodologies that were used
    throughout the IAP process to ensure the confidentiality of claimants and other
    participants in the IAP when producing statistical reports: s</span>tatistical
    aggregation of data; data generalization; and data suppression.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>The same statistical
    principles and methodologies employed to ensure the confidentiality,
    reliability, and utility of the existing statistical reports would presumably be
    used in the creation of the proposed Static Reports. The proposed Static
    Reports are statistical reports and, as Mr. Tetreault and Ms. Hansen indicate
    in their respective affidavits, statistical reports are produced in accordance
    with these statistical principles and methodologies.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Second, there was no
    evidence in support of the Supervising Judge’s conclusion that the data in the
    proposed Static Reports could or would be manipulated. Specifically, the
    Supervising Judge’s reasons reference no evidence in relation to his statements
    at para. 223 that the reliability and soundness of “some models” that he
    reviewed was doubtful and that unreliable and contentious conclusions might be
    drawn regarding acts of student-on-student abuse at particular schools.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Third, there was no evidence
    that the production of the proposed Static Reports would impair the goals of
    truth and reconciliation. On the contrary, as the Supervising Judge
    acknowledged by the inclusion of the existing statistical reports in the
    Non-Claim Records collection, the data within statistical reports are of
    historical importance. Notably, these data no doubt hold important information
    on how widespread the physical and sexual abuse was in the Indian Residential Schools.
    If confidentiality and reliability are ensured, the proposed Static Reports will
    be available to advance truth and reconciliation by presenting and preserving data
    about the history, impact, and legacy of Canada’s Indian Residential Schools.
    In this way, the proposed Static Reports would further the objectives of the
    IRSSA.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conclusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    concerns about the need to ensure the confidentiality, reliability, and
    archival utility of the proposed Static Reports, and his concern regarding the
    lack of sufficient evidence, are valid concerns. However, there was no evidence
    before the Supervising Judge to substantiate those concerns.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Having identified his
    concerns pertaining to confidentiality, reliability, and archival utility, the
    Supervising Judge should have required further evidence be adduced.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>In our view, one of the
    principal obstacles faced by the parties and the Supervising Judge is that no
    proposed Static Reports were generated. Only model proposed Static Reports were
    provided to the Supervising Judge. Without generating the proposed Static
    Reports in their final form, it is difficult if not impossible to determine
    whether the proposed Static Reports should be produced and archived. Generation
    of the proposed Static Reports will allow the parties to respond to the
    Supervising Judge’s concerns, articulate any specific objections, and
    substantiate those objections with reference to specific areas of issue in the
    proposed Static Reports.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Accordingly, we order that
    any proposed Static Reports be produced in final form by the Chief Adjudicator,
    placed under seal, and submitted to the Supervising Judge prior to the
    rehearing. If the Chief Adjudicator is unable to produce the proposed Static
    Reports prior to the closure of the Secretariat, the parties may seek direction
    from this court.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>For clarity, the proposed
    Static Reports could include those already produced in Exhibit “K” to Ms.
    Hansen’s affidavit if those reports are, in fact, in final form. The
    Supervising Judge will then determine how the proposed Static Reports will be
    produced under seal, prior to the rehearing, to the parties and their experts
    for the purposes of the rehearing. Production of these proposed Static Reports
    under seal will allow the parties the opportunity to review the proposed Static
    Reports in their final form, and adduce further evidence to properly address, or
    make submissions concerning, the risk of disclosure of confidential IAP
    information, their reliability, and their archival validity.</span></p>

    the Non-Claim Records.</span></p>

    the historical and archival importance of the Non-Claim Records, including
    those pertaining to the administration and workings of the Chief Adjudicator,
    the IAP Oversight Committee, and the Secretariat. As he stated at para. 193 of
    his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Claim Records and the Non-Claim Records
    are both important parts of creating a comprehensive historical record and of
    fulfilling Canada’s duty to compile a comprehensive and accessible record based

    personal and collective right to know, and the state’s duty to remember.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>The Supervising Judge was
    required to balance non-claimant individual rights to privacy, confidentiality,
    and legal privilege with the goals enshrined in the IRSSA. In doing so, he
    determined that the following categories of Non-Claim Records contained
    confidential, sensitive, and privileged information. This determination was
    rooted firmly in the unchallenged evidence of Mr. Tetreault and the archival
    assessment of Edward Tompkins, appended to Mr. Tetreault’s affidavit, which the
    Supervising Judge accepted.</span></p>

    records were excluded from the Chief Adjudicator’s proposal. The Supervising
    Judge agreed with the Chief Adjudicator that disclosure of the adjudicator
    performance records would undermine deliberative secrecy and the finality of
    the IAP by providing a basis for collateral attacks on adjudicators’ decisions
    and re-litigation of matters settled in IAP proceedings. He also agreed that
    the idea of disclosing the records of adjudicators’ personal employment
    information was particularly inappropriate given the confidential nature of the
    IAP whereby decisions are not available for review.</span></p>

    Committee Records relate to the committee’s <em>in camera</em> sessions that arose
    in confidence. These also include records not normally made public: agendas;
    document packages; emails that may include sensitive personal information about
    adjudicators’ performance; complaints against claimant counsel and others; and
    information subject to solicitor-client privilege, litigation privilege, or
    common interest privilege. As a result, the Supervising Judge concluded that
    only publicly available records of the IAP Oversight Committee should be
    included in the Non-Claim Records collection.</span></p>

    information about complaints and investigations into persons acting for claimants
    in connection with the IAP. They contain sensitive personal information and
    allegations against individuals. Some of the information has not been verified,
    corroborated, or tested. In some cases, the allegations were unfounded. A joint
    direction was made by judges in both Ontario and British Columbia that none of
    these documents should be published without prior written approval from the Court
    Monitor. The Supervising Judge therefore determined that the complaint and
    investigation records that had not been disclosed to the public should not be
    included in the Non-Claim Records collection.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='color:black'>The Supervising Judge’s clear prohibition is
    against the public disclosure of confidential IAP information, as confirmed by <em>Fontaine
    (SCC)</em>. This is not controversial but a well-settled prohibition that
    applies equally to Canada and that the Supervising Judge was not permitted to
    revisit. As the Supervising Judge indicated at para. 203 of his reasons, “the
    NCTR is free to build as comprehensive an archive as it may outside of the
    strictures of the IRSSA, which strictures it must observe just as much as Canada
    must observe those strictures.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black'>However, the Supervising Judge did not prohibit
    Canada from transferring any other Non-Claim Records to the NCTR. As he stated

    archiving copies of Non-Claim Documents with the NCTR,” and “there is,
    practically speaking, no meaningful dispute between the parties about the
    appropriateness of the NCTR as an archive for copies of the Non-Claim Records.”
    As such, copies of appropriate Non-Claim Records, not originals, can be
    delivered to the NCTR, following the approach used by Goudge J.A. in <em>Fontaine
    v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2013 ONSC 684, 114 O.R. (3d) 263, as
