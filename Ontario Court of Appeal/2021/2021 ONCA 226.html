    from the conviction entered on January 25, 2017 and the sentence imposed on June
    15, 2017 by Justice Nancy L. Backhouse of the Ontario Superior Court, sitting
    without a jury.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Tulloch J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 13, 2014, police executed a search
    warrant at the appellant’s family home. They located a large .44 Magnum Taurus handgun
    with live ammunition in a small dresser in the appellant’s bedroom.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the appellant, his friend, X.Y.,
    placed the handgun and live ammunition in the appellant’s music studio, unbeknownst
    to him. When the appellant learned that the gun and ammunition were in his studio,
    he decided to move the items into his locked bedroom for temporary safekeeping.
    Unfortunately for the appellant, five days later, police searched his residence
    and seized the items.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> While the appellant contends that the gun and
    ammunition belonged to his friend and not him, he did not turn the items into
    the police nor did he insist that they be removed immediately from his
    possession upon discovering them in his studio. In other words, based on the
    factual narrative of this case, there was no doubt that the appellant was
    knowingly in possession of the gun and ammunition, and that he had no licence
    or authorization to possess such items. To compound the problem with the
    possession of the firearm and ammunition, the appellant also had what appeared
    to be drug trafficking paraphernalia in his possession. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was charged with various firearms
    offences. Following a judge-alone trial, the appellant was found guilty of all
    charges and subsequently sentenced to 2 years and 3 months’ incarceration, less
    114 days credit for time served.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant now appeals his convictions on the
    basis that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, resulting in
    a miscarriage of justice. He advances three main reasons for this position:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s counsel previously represented his
    friend, X.Y., which placed the appellant’s counsel into a conflict of interest
    that negatively affected the appellant’s trial;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s counsel improperly advised the
    appellant to testify at his trial and his testimony ensured his own conviction;
    and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The representation by the appellant’s counsel at
    trial was ineffective.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following the convictions, both the appellant
    and his defence counsel provided affidavits and oral testimony, which form the
    basis of a fresh evidence application at this appeal. Since the appellant seeks
    to set aside his convictions on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel,
    it is in the interests of justice to consider the fresh evidence: <em>R. v. W. (W.) </em>(1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 161 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 169-170.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    conviction appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his notice of appeal, the appellant asks for
    leave to appeal his sentence. It appears that he has since abandoned his
    sentencing appeal. Accordingly, I would also dismiss the sentencing appeal as
    abandoned.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Background Facts</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Events Leading Up to the Search Warrant and
    Arrest</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant lived at a home with his parents,
    grandparents, two younger siblings and uncle. At the back of the home, there
    was a shed that he had converted into a music studio.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As indicated earlier, X.Y. was the appellant’s
    friend. On April 8, 2014, X.Y. texted the appellant to advise that he had left
    something in the music studio. X.Y. asked the appellant to keep it safe for him
    until he could retrieve it upon his return to Toronto; he was headed to the
    United States for a short trip. The appellant found out that the “something”
    that X.Y. had left behind was a gun. The appellant was upset, and texted X.Y.
    to ask that he retrieve the weapon as soon as he returned to the city. He also condemned
    X.Y. for leaving the firearm at his residence and ended their friendship. The
    appellant had an additional reason to be upset: X.Y. was aware that the
    appellant was under a court order prohibiting him from possessing weapons at
    the time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant moved the firearm into his bedroom
    for safe keeping, as people freely filtered in and out of the music studio and
    his bedroom had a locked door. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 13, 2014, X.Y. contacted the appellant
    to advise him that he was back in town and would collect his gun. On that same
    day, the Toronto Police Service executed a search warrant at the appellant’s
    home. The telewarrant had been issued pursuant to s. 11 of the <em>Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act, </em>S.C. 1996, c. 19, (“CDSA”) to search for drug
    related items. The basis for the search was a tip from a confidential
    informant. The police did not find any narcotics, but as noted above, they did
    find the firearm and ammunition. Thus, as a result of the search, the appellant
    was charged with a number of weapons related charges. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>X.Y. gave the appellant’s mother a phone number
    for a defence lawyer. Several years prior to the matter at issue, and when X.Y.
    was a youth, that same lawyer represented X.Y. at his own criminal trial. The
    appellant retained this lawyer for his trial knowing that he had previously
    represented X.Y.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Evidence at the Preliminary Inquiry</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A preliminary inquiry was held on September 8,
    2015. The parties agreed to tender the evidence from the preliminary hearing at
    trial, supplemented with some further evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence at the preliminary hearing
    indicated that before executing the search warrant, the police arrested the
    appellant outside his home for possession of cocaine and marijuana for the
    purpose of trafficking.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Soon thereafter, the appellant’s grandfather
    identified the appellant’s bedroom to the police officers. Inside, they found a
    .44 Magnum Taurus handgun in a dresser containing male clothing, as well as
    seven loose rounds of .44 calibre ammunition, a box of fifty .44 calibre
    ammunition, and a number of shotgun shells. A dresser in the room contained
    paperwork from the Canada Revenue Agency bearing the appellant’s name. A safe
    in the bedroom closet contained his passport, driver’s licence and other forms
    of identification. Other items found in the bedroom included: a small digital
    scale, empty baggies, a collapsible baton, and a trigger lock that was found in
    another safe in the bedroom. The officers did not find any drugs in the
    appellant’s room or on his person.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel cross-examined the police
    officers at the preliminary inquiry regarding the reason for the arrest, as
    well as the circumstances surrounding the search, both with respect to the
    purpose of the search warrant and the manner of its execution.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter </span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>Application</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After the preliminary inquiry, the appellant
    brought an application under s. 8 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and
    Freedoms</em> to exclude the evidence that the police obtained pursuant to the
    search warrant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the hearing of the <em>Charter</em> application, the appellant’s position was that the police used the <em>CDSA </em>search
    warrant as a guise to gain entry into the residence to conduct a search for firearms,
    rather than drugs. According to defence counsel, it followed that the information
    to obtain the search warrant did not contain full, fair and frank disclosure of
    the true purpose of the search. Further, defence counsel submitted that the
    warrant lacked reasonable grounds to believe that drug dealing was occurring on
    the premises and the officers improperly relied upon the telewarrant procedure.
    Lastly, defence counsel argued that the warrant had been improperly executed. Specifically,
    he alleged that the officers did not show the warrant to the appellant or any
    of the other occupants of the residence upon request, in contravention of s.
    29(2) of the <em>Criminal Code, </em>R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46<em>.</em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also sought to reveal the identity
    of the confidential informant, pursuant to the innocence at stake exception to
    informer privilege. Defence counsel argued that X.Y., or someone he knew, had
    planted the gun and informed the police on the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 18, 2017, the judge dismissed the
    appellant’s application, finding that the warrant had been properly obtained
    and executed. She further concluded that there was full, fair, and frank
    disclosure in the information to obtain.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge also found that the
    appellant’s submissions on the innocence at stake exception failed to meet the
    high threshold necessary to reveal the identity of the confidential informant.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>IV.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Judicial Pretrial</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After receiving the decision denying the <em>Charter</em> application, defence counsel arranged to conduct a judicial pretrial with
    another judge. The judicial pretrial was held that afternoon. In the pretrial,
    the Crown made an offer of a three-year sentence in exchange for a guilty plea
    to a breach of s. 95(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Defence counsel rejected
    the Crown’s offer and instead elected to proceed to trial before the application
    judge. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>V.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Trial</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s case began on January 18, 2017. The
    Crown called two officers who took part in the search and who had already
    testified at the preliminary inquiry.</span></p>

    counsel essentially asked one question: did the police use sniffer dogs when
    exercising the search warrant? The officers answered no.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence case began on January 19, 2017. Defence
    counsel requested a brief adjournment so that he could locate X.Y. and serve
    him with a subpoena to testify. The trial judge denied the adjournment request,
    reasoning that defence counsel should have served X.Y. with the subpoena in
    advance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant then testified. He explained the
    circumstances under which X.Y. had left the gun at his home. The appellant
    noted that he did not ask for the gun to be left there, nor did he want it left
    there. He was angry with X.Y. for ever putting him or his family in this
    position. The appellant moved the gun from the music studio to his bedroom
    where it would be safer because fewer people would have access to it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also testified about why he did
    not bring the firearm to the police station. First, the appellant testified
    that he was afraid of retribution from X.Y. if he did return the gun and he did
    not want to be known as a snitch in the neighbourhood. Second, the appellant
    was afraid to turn the gun in because he had witnessed police officers beat his
    friend to death. He had also had other negative interactions with the police,
    which led him to fear that the police would try to “pin it” on him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also testified that the scale and
    baggies found in his room were for his jewellery business and were not related
    to drug trafficking. He indicated that he used the sealed baggies to contain
    earrings, chains and other items that he sold at a flea market; and he used the
    scale to measure the weights of different earrings. He denied ever selling
    marijuana or cocaine from his house. He also denied ownership of the extendable
    baton and trigger lock, both of which police found in his bedroom.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel again requested an adjournment
    of the trial to locate X.Y. on January 20, 2017. The application judge again
    denied the request.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his closing statement, defence counsel
    alleged a conspiracy between the Crown and the police to frame the appellant. He
    indicated that the firearm would not be in the appellant’s residence but for the
    involvement of police and the alleged confidential informant, X.Y. He also argued
    that the appellant had no ill-intention with respect to the firearm and in fact
    repudiated X.Y. for leaving it at his residence in the first place. Furthermore,
    defence counsel argued that the appellant exercised a quasi-public function by moving
    the firearm from an insecure location to his bedroom until X.Y. could pick it
    up. According to defence counsel, the appellant “did all that he could to take
    innocent possession of that firearm.”</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s defence
    and convicted the appellant of five firearms offences: (1) possession of a
    loaded, restricted firearm, together with readily accessible ammunition,
    without a licence or registration certificate (<em>Criminal Code, </em>s.
    95(1)); (2) possession of a firearm knowing its possession is unauthorized (<em>Criminal
    Code, </em>s. 92(1)); (3) unlawful possession of a firearm (<em>Criminal Code, </em>s.
    91(1)); (4) possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so (<em>Criminal
    Code, </em>s. 117.011); and (5) careless storage of ammunition (<em>Criminal
    Code, </em>s. 86.1). As noted above, he received a sentence of two years and
    three months’ imprisonment, less time served.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found no evidence to support the
    defence theory that anything was planted or that the police had orchestrated a
    conspiracy or entrapment scheme against the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge further concluded that this was
    not a case of innocent possession. While recognizing that the firearm and
    ammunition may have fallen into the accused’s possession without his knowledge
    initially, the trial judge found that: “after he became aware of the items, all
    of the decisions were made by him.” Specifically, the appellant knew that
    possessing the firearm and ammunition was illegal. In fact, he was under a
    firearm prohibition at the material time. Moreover, the appellant had knowledge,
    personal possession and control of the firearm and ammunition over a five-day
    period after he became aware that they had been left in his music studio; and
    the appellant’s intention was to hand back a deadly weapon to X.Y., not to turn
    it into police or otherwise destroy it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In coming to her decision, the trial judge noted
    that there was no identification found in the bedroom for anyone other than the
    accused. The bedroom also contained male adult clothing and other items,
    including the baggies and scale, which the appellant admitted were his. The
    trial judge found aspects of the appellant’s evidence not credible, including
    his testimony that he had no knowledge of the trigger lock and baton found in
    his bedroom. </span></p>

    whether a miscarriage of justice occurred due to ineffective assistance of
    counsel. The appellant raises three concerns with respect to defence counsel’s assistance
    during the trial proceedings: (1) his representation of the appellant was
    negatively impacted by a conflict of interest arising from his previous
    representation of X.Y.; (2) he improperly encouraged the appellant to testify,
    ensuring his conviction; and (3) he represented the appellant in an ineffective
    manner. I will deal with each allegation in turn.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that defence counsel was in
    a conflict of interest when representing the appellant after previously
    representing X.Y., particularly in light of the alleged involvement of X.Y. in
    the case against the appellant. Again, the defence argued that X.Y. might have
    been the confidential informant or was an agent for the police when planting
    the firearm at the appellant’s home. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that representing both
    parties runs contrary to r. 3.4-10 of the Law Society of Ontario’s <em>Rules of
    Professional Conduct, </em>which provides that a lawyer shall not act against a
    former client in the same matter, any related matter, or any other matter if
    the lawyer has relevant confidential information, unless the former client
    consents. In oral submissions, counsel for the appellant argued that X.Y.’s
    matter was related to the case at bar because he was alleged to be a
    confidential informant against the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that defence counsel should
    have recognized that there was a conflict; he should have explained the
    conflict of interest and any related risks to the appellant; he should have
    obtained a waiver from both the appellant and X.Y.; and he should have required
    the appellant to obtain independent legal advice prior to retaining defence
    counsel. As the appellant points out, defence counsel did none of these things.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the appellant, the conflict could explain
    defence counsel’s failure to call X.Y. as a witness, to subpoena him in a
    timely manner, or to interview him as a witness. In light of defence counsel’s
    allegations against X.Y. in relation to this matter – <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>i.e</span></em><i>.</i>, that he was a confidential
    informant or planted the firearm – X.Y.’s evidence was needed at trial. Defence
    counsel failed to obtain his evidence. According to the appellant, this was
    evidence of incompetent lawyering.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In making his submissions on this issue, the
    appellant relies on a decision of this court: <em>R. v. Baharloo</em>, 2017
    ONCA 362, 348 C.C.C. (3d) 64. In <em>Baharloo</em>, the court considered an
    ineffective assistance of counsel claim where trial counsel represented the
    alternate suspect giving rise to a potential conflict of interest. The
    appellant relies on the following passage from that decision:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[51]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a minimum,
    before accepting a retainer from Banda in August 2012 to represent her on the
    possession of cocaine charge, <span class=Underline>[trial counsel] was
    required to fully disclose to both the appellant and Banda the issues and risks
    associated with concurrent representation, secure their informed consent to
    concurrent representation, and reasonably conclude that she would be able to
    represent each client without adversely affecting the other</span>:&nbsp;<em>Neil</em>,
    at para. 29. That [trial counsel] did not do.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[52]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By accepting the
    retainer to act for Banda on the possession of cocaine charge, [trial counsel]
    put herself in an actual conflict of interest with respect to her
    representation of the appellant. <span class=Underline>Her representation of
    the appellant, from that point forward at the latest, was tainted by impermissible
    divided loyalties and an actual conflict of interest</span>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[53]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this court
    stated in&nbsp;<em>W. (W.),</em> at p. 178, <span class=Underline>the real
    issue on appeal in cases involving allegations of conflicts of interest arising
    out of the joint defence of co-accused “will be whether there was an actual
    conflict of interests. If that conflict is demonstrated, the conclusion that at
    least one of the co-accused did not receive effective representation will
    follow in most cases.” That applies with equal force to the present case, even
    though the retainers involved different matters and the appellant and Banda
    were not co-accused</span>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[54]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the
    appellant has demonstrated that (i) an actual conflict of interest existed by
    [trial counsel]’s concurrent representation of Banda and him, and (ii) that
    conflict impaired [trial counsel]’s ability to represent effectively the
    appellant’s interests. It led [trial counsel] to fail to pursue a third party
    suspect defence which, in the circumstances, was a realistically available
    defence. The appellant has established a lack of effective assistance by trial
    counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[55]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the
    ineffective assistance [trial counsel] provided to the appellant because of her
    conflict of interest, a miscarriage of justice occurred:&nbsp;<em>W. (W.),</em> at p. 173. The appellant’s conviction cannot stand.  [Emphasis added].</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that this court’s reasoning
    in <em>Baharloo </em>is apposite to the case at bar. Specifically, in this
    case, the appellant submits that defence counsel did not recognize the conflict,
    failed to ensure the appellant sought out independent legal advice, failed to
    obtain waivers from both clients, failed to apprise the appellant of the risks
    of the conflict, and then failed to ensure X.Y. gave evidence before putting the
    appellant on the stand. The appellant suggests that these facts constitute
    evidence of an actual conflict of interest that impaired trial counsel’s
    ability to represent the appellant’s interests effectively. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant further relies on the following

    which permeates and infects counsel's entire performance. <span

    counsel represents competing interests at trial, and as a result, counsel's
    ability to represent either or both of those interests is adversely affected, a
    miscarriage of justice has occurred without any inquiry into the effect of the
    conflict on the reliability of the verdict. This is so because counsel's
    undivided loyalty to the client is an essential component of a fair adversarial
    process. Where counsel's loyalty is divided and the client suffers as a
    consequence, the adversarial dynamic of the trial is lost and with it the
    fairness of the trial:</span> <em>R. v. Dunbar and Logan</em>&nbsp;(1982), 68

lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the failure to

lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the conflict of

    he contends that the convictions should be set aside, and a new trial ordered.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Position of the Crown </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the outset, the Crown notes that the
    appellant was aware that his lawyer had previously represented X.Y. when the
    appellant retained him, and the prior representation of X.Y. happened years
    before, for a completely unrelated matter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown argues that r. 3.4-10 of the <em>Rules
    of Professional Conduct</em> allows a lawyer to act against a former client on
    an unrelated matter where there is no risk that the confidential information obtained
    during the representation of the former client would be used in the new
    representation. According to the Crown, this was an unrelated matter and defence
    counsel did not learn any confidential information from X.Y. during the course
    of his unrelated, earlier retainer that could have been used in his
    representation of the appellant. Therefore, the Crown submits that defence
    counsel did not act in contravention of the <em>Rules of Professional Conduct.</em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the Crown submits that the appellant
    has not established that there was an actual conflict of interest. The Crown
    argues that defence counsel acted with undivided loyalty towards the appellant:
    first, he subpoenaed X.Y. to testify; and second, he vigorously argued at trial
    that X.Y. was the confidential informant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Further, the Crown asserts that the timing of X.Y.’s
    subpoena did not amount to incompetence. Defence counsel explained that he did
    not seek to subpoena X.Y. until he felt it was absolutely necessary, which was
    after the judge dismissed the s. 8 <em>Charter</em> application on January 18,
    2017. Defence counsel twice requested an adjournment so that he could serve X.Y.
    with a subpoena to secure his attendance to testify. The trial judge rejected
    both of these requests. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the Crown, X.Y. ultimately was
    served with the subpoena and he appeared on January 20, 2017, but the
    proceedings had already been adjourned for the day. X.Y. attended again on
    January 25, 2017, when the trial judge was to issue her decision. Although she
    was aware of X.Y.’s presence, the trial judge was unwilling to revisit her
    earlier ruling given the limited relevance of his evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown argues that X.Y.’s evidence would have
    been of limited relevance and would not have exculpated the appellant nor
    eliminated the need for him to testify. The text message exchange between X.Y.
    and the appellant tendered on the s. 8 application already indicated that X.Y.
    left the gun at the appellant’s home without the appellant’s consent.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits that even assuming X.Y.
    testified consistently with the text messages, at most, X.Y.’s evidence would
    have confirmed that he left the gun in the appellant’s music studio and
    eventually told the appellant that he had done so. Given that the gun was found
    in the appellant’s bedroom, there would have been an undeniable inference that
    the appellant moved the gun from the studio to his bedroom. X.Y.’s testimony
    would have confirmed both the appellant’s personal possession in moving the
    firearm and his constructive possession of it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown also points out that the trial judge
    found X.Y.’s anticipated evidence to be irrelevant to the issues in the trial
    proper, short of questions suggesting that he might be the confidential
    informant, which defence counsel was not permitted to ask having failed on the
    innocence at stake application. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown distinguishes the facts in <em>Baharloo</em> from the current matter. According to the Crown, unlike the current matter, the
    appellant in <em>Baharloo</em> was unaware of the prior representation of the
    potential third party suspect, and the retainers of Mr. Baharloo and the
    potential third party suspect substantially overlapped and were factually
    related.</span></p>

    pp. 15-16, the appellant must show:  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span

lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is not enough simply to have an appearance of
    a conflict. The court must determine whether counsel’s representation was, in
    fact, adversely affected. The concern on appeal must be with what happened and
    not what might have happened: <em>W. (W.)</em>, at pp. 17-19.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The cases provided by the parties on this issue,
    namely <em>Baharloo</em> and <em>W.&nbsp;(W.),</em> consider the issue of a
    potential conflict of interest with another “current client”, as opposed to a
    former client. However, if the trial counsel’s representation of an accused may
    be compromised by a duty to a former client, counsel should first advise the
    new client and obtain their consent. If counsel believes that the duty to the
    former client actually will compromise the new retainer, then the lawyer should
    decline to accept the case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s fresh evidence affidavit
    confirms that after he was arrested in this matter, X.Y. came to his home to
    provide his mother with defence counsel’s phone number. The appellant retained defence
    counsel knowing of his prior representation of X.Y. The appellant accepted the
    referral from the very same person he would accuse of being a confidential
    informant against him. Defence counsel did not need to advise the appellant of
    the former retainer since it was common knowledge that the appellant was
    already aware of it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel owed a duty to X.Y. as a former
    client, at least with regard to not misusing information obtained as a result
    of the former retainer: <em>Canadian National Railway Co., </em>at para. 23.
    Even where there is no such risk, it would be preferable not to act against a
    former client. However, the concern in this appeal is not the duty to X.Y.; it
    is the duty to the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the face of it, there was a potential conflict
    of interest between defence counsel’s representation of the appellant and his
    past representation of X.Y. due to the nature of the argument advanced at
    trial: <em><span style='font-style:normal'>i.e</span></em><i>.,</i> that X.Y.
    was either a confidential informant or planted the firearm at the behest of the
    police. Given the nature of the defence theory, and the potential for a
    conflict, it would have been preferable for defence counsel to decline to
    represent the appellant in this matter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, I am not persuaded that defence counsel’s
    prior representation of X.Y. manifested in an actual conflict that impaired
    trial fairness. On a review of the full trial record, it does not appear that defence
    counsel was torn by any feeling of divided loyalty. Defence counsel was willing
    to require X.Y. to attend at trial. The appellant admitted that defence counsel
    retained a private investigator to try to locate X.Y. to serve him with a
    subpoena. X.Y. was subpoenaed to testify, albeit late in the process. Again,
    the concern on appeal is whether a conflict of interest actually compromised
    representation; the appellate court is not concerned with mere possibilities.</span></p>

    at best, corroborate the appellant’s explanation that he was the unwilling
    recipient of a gun left at his home. There was not much else to be gained from X.Y.’s
    testimony at that point in the proceedings. Again, the outcome of the
    innocence-at-stake application prevented counsel from exploring the issue of
    the confidential informant in the examination of X.Y.</span></p>

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Position of the Appellant</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the affidavit tendered as part of the fresh
    evidence application, the appellant indicated that he and defence counsel
    discussed his testimony and the innocent possession defence for the first time
    just before trial. Defence counsel insisted that the appellant testify. The
    appellant did not want to testify. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the appellant’s testimony at trial, he
    reiterated that: he had control over the bedroom where he stored the gun, he
    consented to it being there, and he was planning to give the gun back to X.Y.
    In short, the appellant contends that his testimony was a complete confession
    that ensured his conviction of the offences charged. According to the
    appellant, it follows that his convictions rest on the ineffective assistance
    of counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s position is that defence counsel
    never should have advised him to testify since his evidence provided all that
    was needed to convict him on the basis of the doctrine of constructive
    possession. According to the appellant, a reasonably competent lawyer would
    have advised the appellant to sit silently and let the Crown prove its case
    against him, as the innocent possession defence had virtually no chance of
    success on these facts.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Position of the Crown</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown argues that the appellant made an
    informed decision to testify in this case. Defence counsel’s evidence was that
    he did, in fact, inform the appellant that he did not need to testify. Additionally,
    the Crown contends that the appellant would have known that he had the right
    not to testify. The appellant had four prior criminal trials, with three prior
    lawyers, and he did not testify at any of those trials. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given that the s. 8 application was unsuccessful,
    it is the Crown’s position that the appellant’s convictions were virtually
    certain on the basis of constructive possession regardless of whether the
    appellant testified, due to the strong circumstantial case against him. The
    Crown submits that there were seven pieces of circumstantial evidence upon
    which the court could draw the inference beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    appellant was aware of the firearm and ammunition found in his bedroom and that
    he had a measure of control over it: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The firearm and a substantial amount of ammunition
    were found in a bedroom identified by the appellant’s grandfather as belonging
    to the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Police found CRA paperwork bearing the
    appellant’s name in the top drawer of one of the dressers in the bedroom,
    indicating he stored items belonging to him in the dressers in the bedroom.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The bag containing the firearm and ammunition
    was immediately visible when the police officer opened a drawer in the second
    dresser in the bedroom.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The bedroom contained adult, male clothing. The
    bag containing the firearm and ammunition was situated on top of male clothing
    in the dresser drawer.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In a different drawer of the same dresser that
    contained the firearm, police found a second weapon – an extendable baton.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A safe in the closet of the bedroom contained
    the appellant’s passport, driver’s licence, SIN card and health card. A trigger
    lock for a gun was also found in a safe in the bedroom. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Paraphernalia consistent with drug dealing was
    found in the bedroom, including a digital scale and a quantity of small ziplock
    baggies.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown argues that it was extremely unlikely
    for the court to find another reasonable inference other than guilt on these
    facts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits that there was no downside to
    testifying in this case. If the appellant did not testify, only the Crown’s
    evidence would be before the trial judge. If the appellant testified, he could
    cast the evidence in the most favourable light. The Crown argues that testifying
    gave him a long shot at an acquittal if the trial judge accepted the innocent
    possession defence. At worst, testifying provided context for the gun being in
    his bedroom, explained the presence of the baggies and scale, and would be
    treated as mitigating factors on sentencing. The Crown states that it cannot be
    a miscarriage of justice for an accused to decide to testify and tell the
    truth. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown points out that evidence from the
    accused is necessary to support an innocent possession defence. While the
    defence of innocent possession was a long shot, it could have succeeded, but
    only if the appellant testified. Accordingly, the Crown submits that defence
    counsel’s advice to testify was apt: testimony that acknowledged possession but
    proved innocent possession was the appellant’s best chance of an acquittal in
    this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown argues that the mitigating impact of his
    testimony was borne out on sentencing. Again, the information the appellant
    supplied resulted in a sentence of two years and three months, which was less
    than the three-year plea deal offered by the Crown.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no dispute that it was the appellant’s
    inalienable right to sit silently at his trial and require the Crown to prove
    its case against him beyond a reasonable doubt. Part of counsel’s duty involves
    advising an accused whether to testify: <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;K.K.M.,</em> 2020
    ONCA 736, at para. 62. A competent lawyer will offer sage advice in this
    regard, but only the client can make the ultimate decision as to whether the
    benefits of testifying outweigh the risks: <em>R. v. Stark</em>, 2017 ONCA 148,
    347 C.C.C. (3D) 73, at para. 17.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While it may very well be true that the
    appellant knew he did not need to testify due to his prior involvement with the
    justice system, this fact cannot displace the responsibility of counsel to
    ensure that an accused is apprised of their rights in a criminal trial. This
    responsibility remains with the lawyer no matter how many times a client has
    previously been committed to trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That being said, I am not persuaded that the
    appellant’s decision to testify was uninformed or involuntary. The appellant
    was fully aware of the considerable evidence against him. Defence counsel
    detailed the significant risk of a conviction on the basis of constructive
    possession in a reporting letter provided to the appellant prior to trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel was right: the appellant was at a

    himself or of another person”: <em>Criminal Code</em>, S. 4(3)(a); <em>R. v.

    blameworthy conduct: <em>R. v. Chalk</em>, 2007 ONCA 815, 88 O.R. (3d) 448, at
    para. 25. The rationale underlying this defence is that criminal liability
    should not attach to brief, “innocent” possession, where the intention is
    solely to divest oneself of control rather than to possess the prohibited item: <em>Chalk</em>, at para. 25.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The cases where innocent possession is a viable
    defence normally involve a person who takes control of contraband out of a
    sense of public duty: to prevent injury to others, to destroy the contraband,
    or to permanently move it beyond their control: <em>Chalk</em>, at para 23-25.
    The defence has been successful in situations that are comparable to that of the
    appellant, where the accused does not opt to turn the gun into the authorities,
    or destroy it: <em>R. v. Ali</em>, 2018 ONCJ 379, at paras. 55-56, 79-83; <em>R.

    a slim chance of success but was nonetheless arguable. Unfortunately for the
    appellant, the trial judge rejected the defence. Although the trial judge
    accepted that the gun fell into the appellant’s possession through no fault of
    his own, she did not accept that he acted out of a public duty in retaining the
    gun to return it to X.Y. She specifically rejected the appellant’s evidence
    that he feared retaliation from X.Y. if he got rid of the firearm. She also
    found that the appellant lied about not knowing about the baton and trigger

lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He points to his counsel’s lack of cross-examination
    at the trial proper. Defence counsel asked only one question of each of the two
    police officers who testified. The appellant submits that failing to conduct
    meaningful cross-examination on the core issue of the case is the kind of
    incompetence that can require a new trial if the result <em>may </em>have been
    different. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argues that defence counsel
    did not understand the basic tenets of constructive possession or innocent
    possession. According to the appellant, defence counsel put his client on the
    stand with no appreciation of the core issue at trial. In support of this
    argument, the appellant points to defence counsel’s submission that: “I
    challenge the absolute foundation of my friend’s assertion that the possession
    is really what’s at issue in this case.” The appellant also relies upon
    counsel’s faltering response when questioned about the definitions of
    constructive possession and innocent possession in his subsequent
    cross-examination that formed part of the fresh evidence tendered for this
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted above, the appellant maintains that defence
    counsel’s failure to issue a timely subpoena and his advice to the appellant to
    testify also amounted to incompetence.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Position of the Crown</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown points out that the only two Crown witnesses at trial were
    already fully cross-examined by defence counsel at the preliminary inquiry and
    their evidence was entered into the trial record on consent. The Crown submits
    that any further evidence at trial from these two officers would not have
    yielded anything useful for the defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown also takes issue with the appellant’s suggestion that defence
    counsel did not understand the elements of constructive possession and innocent
    possession at trial. The Crown points to the fact that defence counsel
    correctly referenced the leading case in his submissions, and fully informed
    the appellant about the risks of conviction on the basis of constructive
    possession in the reporting letter delivered prior to trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown argues that counsel’s performance was reasonable in this
    case. It also submits that, even if it was imperfect, counsel’s failure to meet
    competence standards does not automatically lead to a reversal of a conviction.
    Here, the Crown contends that the appellant has failed to show how he was
    prejudiced by his counsel’s representation, such that it occasioned a
    miscarriage of justice. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The right to effective assistance of counsel is a principle of
    fundamental justice: <em>R. v. G.D.B</em>., 2000 SCC 22, 143 C.C.C. (3d) 289,
    at para. 24. As Doherty&nbsp;J.A. wrote in <em>Joanisse,</em> at p. 57: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Where counsel fails to provide effective representation,
    the fairness of the trial, measured both by reference to the reliability of the
    verdict and the adjudicative fairness of the process used to arrive at the
    verdict, suffers. In some cases the result will be a miscarriage of justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>To succeed on a ground of appeal on the basis of ineffective

  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span
lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the facts on which the ineffectiveness claim is

  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the representation provided by trial
    counsel amounted to incompetence on a reasonableness standard (the performance
    component of the test); and </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the incompetent representation resulted in
    a miscarriage of justice (the prejudice component of the test): <em>Joanisse</em>,
    at p. 59; <em>R. v. Archer </em>(2005), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 60 (Ont. C.A.), at
    paras. 119-120;<em> G.D.B</em>., at paras. 24, 26; <em>R. v. Hartling</em>,
    2020 ONCA 243, 150 O.R. (3d) 224, at paras. 73-74; <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Cherrington</em>,
    2018 ONCA 653, at para. 25. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This test presents a high bar that is not easily met: <em>Cherrington, </em>at para. 25. The standard is not perfection. Rather, the court must
    measure counsel’s performance or competence against a reasonableness standard,
    having regard to the circumstances as they existed when the impugned acts or
    omissions occurred. Different lawyers may have run the trial differently, but
    that does not mean a trial counsel’s choices are incompetent. Appellate courts
    must give deference to the choices made by trial counsel and the benefit of
    hindsight plays no part in this assessment: <em>Joanisse</em>, at para. 72; <em>Archer,</em> at para. 119; <em>G.D.B</em>., at para. 27; <em>Hartling,</em> at para. 74. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Once the appellant has established the facts underpinning the claim
    of ineffectiveness under the first branch of the test, the analysis turns to
    the third branch – the prejudice component. If there was no prejudice, then it
    is undesirable for the court to proceed to the second branch, or the
    performance component, of the test: <em>G.D.B.,</em> at para. 29; <em>Hartling</em>,
    at para. 74. In regard to the prejudice element of the test, there are two ways
    to show prejudice: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span
lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>the appellant must establish that there is a reasonable probability
    that the verdict would have been different had he received effective legal
    representation; or </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>he must show that his counsel’s conduct deprived
    him of a fair trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>A reasonable probability is a “probability sufficient to undermine
    confidence in the outcome”: <em>Joanisse</em>, at paras. 74, 79-80; <em>Archer,</em> at para. 120; <em>R. v. Davies</em>, 2008 ONCA 209, 234 O.A.C. 291, at para.
    37. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>If prejudice is made out, the court turns to the second branch – the
    performance component. The analysis under the second branch proceeds upon a
    strong presumption that counsel’s conduct fell within the wide parameters of
    reasonable professional assistance: <em>G.D.B.,</em> at para. 27; <em>Hartling</em>,
    at para. 74. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Turning to the facts at hand, I agree with the position of the
    Crown. I have not been persuaded that trial counsel’s alleged incompetence
    undermined the integrity or reliability of the verdicts, or that it rendered
    the trial unfair. Stated otherwise, the appellant has failed to establish
    prejudice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The thrust of the defence at the trial proper was innocent
    possession, which required evidence of the appellant’s intention. It was
    advisable in the circumstances for the appellant to testify. This
    recommendation by counsel did not amount to incompetence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Nor did counsel’s cross-examination rise to the level of
    incompetence. The police officers simply acted on a search warrant and
    identified what they found. The question posed in cross-examination as to
    whether they used sniffer dogs related to the allegation that the search
    warrant really was not about drugs, but to find the firearm planted by X.Y.
    This was consistent with the appellant’s position that he was framed. The
    cross-examination of the police officers from the preliminary inquiry was
    already before the judge. The failure to cross-examine further does not mean
    that the representation was incompetent, or that there was a miscarriage of
    justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Moreover, as I noted above, I do not think that the absence of a
    timely subpoena would have reasonably altered the course of the trial. While it
    was certainly inadvisable to leave the subpoena to the day the witness was
    supposed to testify, I am not persuaded that his testimony would have had an
    impact on the verdict. Again, his best shot at an acquittal was innocent
    possession, and the trial judge squarely rejected that defence based on a
    sufficient evidentiary record.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Furthermore, a review of the record demonstrates that defence
    counsel was competent with respect to his understanding of the legal concepts
    of constructive possession and innocent possession at the time of trial. His
    reporting letter and his submissions on the issue show his understanding. The
    quote referenced by the appellant – “I challenge the absolute foundation of my
    friend's assertion that the possession is really what's at issue in this case”
    – is anomalous when contextualized with the full record. I would not accede to
    the appellant’s submission on this point.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Finally, defence counsel’s failure to issue a timely subpoena for X.Y.
    did not prejudice the appellant. As explained above, there was no reasonable
    probability that the verdict would have been different had X.Y. testified at
    trial. That said, while it did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance
    of counsel, leaving a subpoena until the last minute was certainly inadvisable.
    On different facts, a failure to issue a timely subpoena of a key witness could
    lead to an unfair trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>G.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Disposition </span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In summary, the appellant retained counsel on the recommendation of
    the very person the appellant accused of being a confidential informant against
    him, knowing that the recommended counsel previously represented that same
    person.  The appellant subsequently failed in his attempt to exclude the
    evidence of a gun and ammunition found in his bedroom, when the only
    identification found in that bedroom belonged to the appellant. The appellant
    was at substantial risk of conviction on the basis of constructive possession.
    The appellant unsuccessfully advanced a defence of innocent possession but was
    successful in receiving a lower sentence than was previously offered by the
    Crown. The convictions were not the result of any failure of representation,
    nor did they result from a miscarriage of justice.</span></p>
