  <p><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Tulloch

  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>O</span>verview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 24, 2011, Bartosz Gajewski, the respondent, was found not
    criminally responsible (“NCR”) on account of mental disorder on charges of
    assault and forcible confinement. Since then, the respondent has been subject
    to the jurisdiction of the Ontario Review Board (the “ORB” or the “Board”).
    Until the disposition under appeal, the respondent was detained at the general forensic
    unit of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (“CAMH” or the “Hospital”)
    with privileges including residing in the community in approved accommodations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his most recent disposition dated April 16, 2020 (reasons issued
    April 22, 2020), the Board conditionally discharged the respondent: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>[2020] O.R.B.D. No. 755, </span>at para. 61, (“<em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ORB,
    2020)”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals this April 16, 2020 disposition. It asks this court to
    either add a geographic boundary condition to the respondent’s disposition, or
    to remit the matter to the Board for a re-hearing. The respondents, Mr.
    Gajewski and the CAMH, each ask this court to dismiss the appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons below, the appeal is dismissed.  </span></p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background</h1>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Events Leading Up to the Index Offences</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In December 2002, the respondent first met the victim of the index
    offences, K.N. The respondent was a cabinet maker at the time. The victim was
    the respondent’s “indirect boss” as the owner of a design firm that had
    contracted the respondent’s employer. The respondent became fixated on the
    victim and formed the delusion that she was in love with him. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2003, the respondent was charged with criminally harassing her and
    threatening bodily harm. Approximately two months after he was charged, the
    respondent’s mother and his brother went to a Justice of the Peace. They were
    granted a Form 2 order under the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Mental Health Act</span></em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7,<em> </em>for the respondent to be assessed at a hospital.
    The respondent’s family was concerned that he was not doing well and could be a
    danger to the victim. In March 2004, these charges were resolved by way of a
    peace bond with a duration of one year, barring any contact with the victim and
    her father.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2004, the respondent appeared before a Justice of the Peace and
    attempted to lay charges against the victim, her father, and sixteen other
    people. He believed that these individuals were collaborating against him; that
    the victim had infiltrated multiple areas of his life; that she had tried to
    forcefully convert him back to Christianity (he had recently begun studying the
    Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses); and that she and her father were conspiring
    against the respondent to create problems for him. The Justice of the Peace
    held that there was a lack of evidence for the charges to proceed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2007, while the respondent was working for another employer, he was
    informed by that employer that his wages were to be garnished due to a tax
    assessment. The respondent believed that the victim was involved in having this
    assessment brought against him. In late 2008, the respondent decided that he
    needed to “arrest” the victim, as he needed to question her under oath
    regarding the tax assessment. He did not think he could contact the police
    because he still believed that they were conspiring with the victim. The
    respondent planned what he viewed as a citizen’s “arrest” of the victim. </p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Index Offences</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 17, 2009, the respondent committed the index offences,
    approximately five years after he last contacted the victim. The respondent
    attempted to abduct K.N. from her neighborhood, purporting to place her under a
    citizen’s arrest for public mischief and fraud. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    victim was seated in her car, awaiting her business partner. The respondent
    opened the vehicle door and informed the victim that he was placing her under
    arrest pursuant to the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code, </span></em>R.S.C.,
    1985, c. C-46, and in the name of “<span lang=EN-CA>Jehovah God”</span>. The
    respondent pulled the victim by her wrists out of her parked car, and as he
    tried to drag her down the street, repeated his alleged authority for this
    arrest. He intended to hail a taxi to take the victim to his apartment, where
    he would await her apprehension by the Attorney Generals of Canada and Ontario.
    The victim was unable to physically resist the attack. The victim’s business
    partner arrived and immediately intervened. The respondent managed to pull the
    victim and her partner approximately 40 metres down the street, at which point
    two neighbours also intervened. The police were <span lang=EN-CA>called,</span> and they arrested the respondent before he could complete his plan. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the incident, the victim attended a hospital, where it was determined that she
    had sustained torn ligaments in her foot.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police subsequently executed a search warrant at the respondent’s apartment and
    discovered nylon ties, duct tape, and an exacto blade. The respondent stated
    that the nylon ties and tape were to restrain the victim while he waited for
    the Attorney Generals’ arrival.</p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Previous Dispositions and Decision</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2011, the respondent was found NCR on charges of forcible confinement and
    assault arising from the events set out above. He was diagnosed with delusional
    disorder of a persecutory nature. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    his annual hearing in 2012, the Board ordered the respondent detained in the secure
    forensic unit at CAMH. The Board observed in their reasons that the respondent
    continued to suffer from the delusions he had at the time of the index offence
    and posed a risk to the victim. In 2013 and 2014, the Board found that the
    respondent remained a significant threat to the safety of the public and
    ordered his continued detention in the secure forensic unit, with privileges up
    to and including accompanied hospital and ground privileges. The respondent
    appealed both decisions, and both appeals were dismissed by this court: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>2014 ONCA 332; <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski
    (Re), </span></em>2015 ONCA 332.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    December 2015, the respondent was transferred to the general unit at the Hospital.
    At his annual review in 2016, the Board ordered the respondent detained in the general
    unit, with indirectly supervised entry into the Toronto community on passes for
    up to a week: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>[2016] O.R.B.D.
    No. 2757, at para. 54, (“<em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ORB,
    2016)”). The Board also ordered the respondent to refrain from coming within
    500 metres of <span lang=EN-CA>where the victim lives, works, worships, or is
    otherwise known to be (“the 500 metre prohibition”)</span>: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ORB, 2016), at para. 56. The Crown
    appealed, and this court allowed the appeal in part, holding that the victim’s
    father should be included in the restriction: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski
    (Re),</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span>2017 ONCA 354<span lang=EN-CA> (“<em>Gajewski
    (Re), </em></span>(ONCA, 2017)”).</p>
  <h3>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Geographic Boundary Condition</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the 2016 annual review hearing, the Crown first raised the issue of a
    geographic boundary restriction (“boundary condition”). If the respondent were
    granted indirectly supervised passes or community living, the Crown sought to
    create an exclusion zone around the area where the victim and her father lived
    and worked. The Board rejected this proposal, holding that a blanket geographic
    ban provided illusory reassurance to the victim and that it was less effective
    than an area of exclusion around the individuals themselves: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ORB, 2016),<em> </em>at para. 56. On
    appeal, this court did not take issue with the ORB’s decision with respect to
    the boundary condition: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ONCA,
    2017).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown renewed its request for a boundary condition at the 2018 annual hearing. Four
    of the five Board members <span lang=EN-CA>were not persuaded that a
    geographical boundary provides any greater protection to the victim than the
    terms set out in the October 2016 disposition: <em>Gajewski (Re), </em></span>[2018]
    O.R.B.D. No. 1342, at para. 97. The dissenting member found that a boundary
    restriction could minimize the risk to public safety. The Crown did not appeal
    this disposition.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the respondent’s 2019 annual review, the Crown, relying on the dissent in the
    2018 decision, again sought a boundary restriction. The victim filed a victim
    impact statement that did not conform to the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code </span></em>requirements for such statements, as she had done at previous
    hearings. The statement noted how, while NCR individuals must have access to
    the best treatment to improve and return to the community, the Board was also
    tasked with protecting the victim and her father, something that could only be
    done by a boundary condition that ensured physical separation between the NCR
    accused and herself. The Board unanimously rejected the Crown’s request,
    finding that the boundary was unnecessary: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>[2019]
    O.R.B.D. No. 1282, at para. 38 (“<em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ORB,
    2019)”). The panel included the member who dissented at the 2018 hearing.
    However, the Board maintained the no contact condition and the 500 metre
    prohibition: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ORB, 2019), at para.
    39. As I return to below, the respondent appealed this disposition order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    November 2019, this court heard a motion for leave to intervene by the victim
    in the respondent’s appeal of the 2019 disposition. The victim wanted to appeal
    from the Board’s refusal to impose the boundary condition, as the Crown had not
    cross-appealed this issue: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>2020
    ONCA 4, at paras. 1, 23, (“<em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ONCA,
    2020)”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Strathy
    C.J.O. rejected the motion: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ONCA,
    2020), at paras.&nbsp;1, 23, 36. He commented on the victim’s desire for the
    boundary condition at paras. 33 and 35: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, her concerns with respect to a
    boundary restriction were articulated by the Crown on three occasions, in 2016,

  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Relevant Evidence and the Positions of the Parties </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    January 2020 Hospital report was presented as evidence at the hearing. It noted
    that the respondent maintains his delusional beliefs, has minimal insight into
    his mental illness, and would discontinue medication immediately if given the
    opportunity. It also described how the respondent denies any desire to harm or
    contact the victim, and that he would only seek revenge in the form of a civil
    remedy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board also accepted a victim impact statement from K.N., despite it again not
    conforming with the requirements of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em>.
    The Board indicated in its reasons that it allowed the victim impact statement to
    be filed on the understanding that it would “only consider the relevant
    portions”: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ORB, 2020), at
    para. 18, footnote 2. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown and the Hospital agreed that the respondent remained a significant threat.
    Counsel for the respondent did not argue to the contrary. In other words, the
    significant threat issue was uncontested. Instead, the submissions largely
    focused on what was the least onerous disposition available in the
    circumstances. Counsel for the respondent and the Hospital submitted that a
    conditional discharge was appropriate, while counsel for the Crown argued for a
    detention order: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ORB, 2020), at
    paras. 4-5.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also argued that any disposition should include a boundary condition. The
    respondent opposed this request arguing that it would impose an unnecessary
    limit on his liberty. Likewise, the Hospital did not support the imposition of
    a boundary condition. It was the position of the respondent’s treating
    psychiatrist, Dr. Pearce, that such a term was unnecessary:<em><span
lang=EN-CA> Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ORB, 2020), at paras. 7, 51. </p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Decision</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board held that the respondent continued to be a significant threat to the
    public. He was conditionally discharged to reside in the community with his
    mother. Conditions included that the respondent would have no contact with the
    victim or her father, and would not be allowed within 500 metres of any place
    they live, work, and worship, or any place he knows them to be: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ORB, 2020), at para. 61. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the Board again refused to include the Crown’s requested boundary condition. In
    reaching this conclusion, the Board relied upon the opinion of the respondent’s
    treating psychiatrist, Dr. Pearce, that this condition was unnecessary.
    Further, the respondent had been in the community for substantial periods of
    time in recent years. Notably, he had resided in the community with family for
    the past six months. Yet, there was no suggestion of him either having or
    seeking out any contact with the victim. Based on this evidence, the Board was
    unable to conclude that the term requested was necessary and appropriate.
    Instead, the concerns of the victim could be addressed by the continuing
    prohibition from contact and the <span lang=EN-CA>500 metre prohibition</span>: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gajewski (Re), </span></em>(ORB, 2020), at paras. 49-52. </p>

    2020 ONCA 233, at paras. 15-17, a case in which this court: (1) noted that s.
    672.542 requires the Board to balance the interests of the NCR accused against

    conditions. As a result, the Crown argues that the Board erred in law by

    whether it is desirable to include any conditions relating to the safety and
    security of a victim, witness, or justice system participant. Under s. 672.542(a),
    the inquiry for the Board is simply whether a no contact term or a prohibition
    against attending a specific place would be desirable in the interests of the
    safety and security of a victim, witness, or other person. Under s. 672.542(b),
    the Board may consider whether it is desirable to impose any other condition
    necessary to ensure the safety or security of such persons. Nothing in the
    wording of this section requires the Board to entertain all proposed conditions
    by the parties. Rather, what conditions may be “desirable” within the meaning
    of s. 672.542 remains squarely within the Board’s discretion.</span></p>

    requires the Board to balance the NCR accused’s interests against those of the
    victim. However, I am not persuaded that the decision of the Board failed to
    meet this obligation. There were terms in the conditional discharge that
    restricted the respondent’s liberty in order to sufficiently protect the
    victim: specifically, the no contact order and the 500 metre prohibition. It is
    also important to bear in mind that the Board must apply s. 672.542 in
    accordance with its other statutory obligations. Specifically, pursuant to s.&nbsp;672.54,
    the Board was required to only impose conditions that are both necessary and appropriate,
    given the twin goals of protecting the public and safeguarding the NCR
    accused’s liberty interests.  In my view, these goals were met by the
    conditions imposed.</span></p>

    described, and there's even indication in the hospital report that the Crown
    had raised concerns, there's some proximity of that address to where the victim

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. I don't know.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. Okay. That was -- I guess when he first had
    his indirect passes they were put on hold for a couple of weeks because that
    concern was raised and then they were reinstituted, or sorry, reinstituted
    after -- within a week because of that; okay. And, and so, if Mr. Gajewski
    himself -- leaving aside from what might benefit the victim, we'll talk about
    that in a moment, but Mr. Gajewski himself seems to be concerned not to want to
    have contact with the victim. <span class=Underline>And would, would it not be
    of some use if he had a definitive area where in fact, he was prohibited from
    going into?</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. <span class=Underline>I mean, that -- I
    mean, I think it's up to the Board in terms of weighing those restrictions on,
    on his liberty and, and the potential risk reduction, or against the victim.
    So, I mean, I don’t think it matters much to me, but if he does get work, I
    want him to be able to, to work where he needs to. That's my only concern.</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. Okay. But should he -- if he were to get
    work, you know, two blocks from the victim, do you think that's acceptable?</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. So indeed, there's going to be some

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. Right. I mean, I don't know, I mean, I

    it represented a restriction in Mr.&nbsp;Gajewski's liberties, which indeed it
    does. <span class=Underline>But could I ask you to also assess it in terms of,

    lived in the community without incident and Dr. Pearce’s testimony. Their
    reasoning on this point was set out at paras. 49-52 of their reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As noted above, Mr. Feindel requests any

    client's freedom. and the hospital does not support it.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>We note that Mr. Gajewski has been in the
    community for substantial periods of time over the last several years and
    residing in the community for the last 6 months. Throughout that time there has
    been no suggestion of his either having or seeking to have any contact with the
    victim. Throughout the time he has been able to be in the community he has
    abided by terms that he have no contact with the victim and certain other
    individuals and that he remain 500 meters from the victim and her father.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Pearce was of the view that such a term

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As noted above, any restriction imposed upon

    a geographic boundary condition in the past, the Crown argues that the change
    from a detention order to a conditional discharge has significant implications

    considerations. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown argues that this case is one where a
    boundary condition was clearly desirable for the victim’s safety and security,
    and there was no evidence that the condition was a significant interference
    with the respondent’s interests. Accordingly, it is the Crown’s position that
    the Board erred in failing to impose the condition. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.
    I agree with counsel for Mr.&nbsp;Gajewski that none of the concerns raised by
    the Crown are borne out in an examination of the transcript and record. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Board did not have to specifically set out
    that Dr. Pearce acknowledged that the victim may find a boundary condition
    helpful. Furthermore, given the history of this case and the multiple times the
    Crown has raised the boundary condition, it cannot be suggested that the Board
    treated the victim’s request in a cursory fashion. In their reasons and
    analysis, the Board focused on the actual issue in this case: namely, whether a
    conditional discharge could keep the public, including the victim, safe. The
    Board concluded that it could.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also do not accede to the Crown’s argument
    that the Board failed to consider the increased safety and security concerns
    with respect to the victim as a result of substituting the detention order with
    a conditional discharge. As the Board recognized, the respondent had already
    spent a significant amount of time in the community and had abided by his
    conditions. The 500 metre prohibition already created a “safe zone” – one that
    was calibrated to be the least onerous and restrictive measure as was necessary
    and appropriate in the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, under a conditional discharge, the
    respondent’s liberty is still subject to significant restrictions. As the name
    of the disposition suggests, the respondent’s liberties are subject to the
    terms set out in the conditional discharge. The Board concluded that the terms
    in the conditional discharge adequately militated against the risk of any harm
    to the public. That was a decision that the Board was entitled to make.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As Doherty J.A. explained in <em>Young (Re), </em>2011
    ONCA 432, 278 O.A.C. 274, at para. 26, the key difference between the detention
    order and the conditional discharge is the mechanism available to the Hospital
    in the event that the respondent needs to be committed. In the event of
    decomposition or any breach to the terms of the conditional discharge, the
    respondent can be returned to a hospital by convening a new hearing under s.
    672.82(1), by resorting to the provisions governing breaches of conditional
    discharges found in s. 672.92, or through the committal provisions available
    under the <em>Mental Health Act</em>. In other words, should any concerns
    arise, the Hospital has mechanisms at its disposal to act. It was in the
    Board’s discretion to decide whether this would suffice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Board’s task in fashioning an appropriate
    disposition order calls for significant expertise. Accordingly, appeal courts
    should not be too quick to overturn the Board’s decision regarding how best to
    manage a patient’s risk to the public: <em>R. v. Conway, </em>2010 SCC 22,
    [2010] 1 SCR 765, at para. 95. I see no basis to interfere with the Board’s
    decision. </span></p>
