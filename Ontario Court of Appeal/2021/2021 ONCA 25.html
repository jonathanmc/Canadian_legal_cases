  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When does a claim that is framed in negligence
    fall within the scrutiny of Ontario’s anti-SLAPP (Strategic Litigation Against
    Public Participation) legislation in s. 137.1 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (“<em>CJA</em>”)? When will such a claim pass the
    legislation’s substantial merit hurdle necessary to allow it to continue? This
    appeal raises those questions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On February 24, 2017, the Canadian Broadcasting
    Corporation (“CBC”) aired an episode of its television show, “<em>Marketplace</em>”.
    It featured an investigative report comparing the contents of chicken
    sandwiches sold by five fast food chains in Canada. The chicken sandwiches sold
    by the respondents (“Subway”) were reported to be made of “only slightly more
    than 50% chicken”, substantially below the chicken content of sandwiches sold
    by the other chains.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Prior to the <em>Marketplace</em> broadcast, CBC
    contracted with a laboratory of the appellant, Trent University (“Trent”), to
    test the chicken content of the sandwiches. The results of that testing were,
    in part, the basis for the statements made on the broadcast. Trent personnel also
    participated in the broadcast.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Subway, alleging that the statements on the
    broadcast were false and that the testing by Trent was inaccurate and
    carelessly done, launched an action against CBC and Trent. The action against
    CBC is exclusively for defamation. As against Trent, the lawsuit asserts two
    causes of action—defamation and negligence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trent moved under s. 137.1 of the <em>CJA</em> to dismiss the part of Subway’s action that made a claim against Trent in
    negligence.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> Section 137.1 contemplates that if a defendant satisfies an initial threshold
    of showing that the claim against it arises out of an expression it made on a
    matter related to the public interest, the claim is to be dismissed unless the
    plaintiff satisfies certain requirements under s. 137.1(4), including showing
    that there are grounds to believe the claim has substantial merit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trent’s motion failed. The motion judge held
    that the negligence claim did not arise from an expression by Trent on a matter
    related to the public interest, since the negligence claim was focussed on the
    quality of the testing, rather than the communication of the results. As the
    initial threshold for a s. 137.1 motion was not met, the negligence claim could
    proceed. In any event, applying the standard that would apply on a motion to
    strike under r. 21 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg.
    194, the motion judge held that the negligence claim had sufficient merit to
    proceed and the harm suffered by Subway (which the continuance of the claim
    sought to remedy) outweighed the public interest in protecting Trent’s
    expression.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge ordered Trent to pay costs of
    its unsuccessful motion to Subway; since the motion had not passed the initial
    threshold, the policy underlying the presumptive no costs for a failed motion
    in s. 137.1(8) was inapplicable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trent appeals the dismissal of its motion and
    the costs it was ordered to pay. The decision on its appeal was deferred until
    after the Supreme Court of Canada released, and the parties had the opportunity
    to make submissions on, certain decisions dealing with s. 137.1 of the <em>CJA</em> and with the principles governing the duty of care analysis in cases of
    negligently caused pure economic loss.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup><sup><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></sup></sup></a></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would allow
    Trent’s appeal from the dismissal of its motion. With the benefit of the
    Supreme Court’s recent jurisprudence, I conclude that Trent satisfied the
    initial threshold of showing that the negligence claim arose from an expression
    on a matter related to the public interest. I also conclude that Subway has not
    satisfied its burden of showing that the negligence claim meets the substantial
    merit requirement under s. 137.1(4). Subway does not have a real prospect of
    success on the issue of whether a relationship of proximity and thus a duty of
    care existed necessary to support Subway’s claim for pure economic loss against
    Trent. Subway’s negligence claim ought to have been dismissed. The motion judge
    erred in concluding otherwise.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given those conclusions, the motion judge’s
    costs order must also be set aside.</span></p>

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Factual Context</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The factual background common to both the
    present appeal and the CBC appeal is set out in the reasons in the CBC appeal. However,
    for ease of understanding of what follows, I highlight certain facts about the
    relationship between Trent and Subway.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trent was retained by CBC to test samples of
    Subway’s sandwiches, as well as those of its competitors. It intended to be
    paid by CBC for its services. This was not academic research.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Neither Trent nor CBC had a contract or any
    pre-existing relationship with Subway.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trent knew that CBC wanted the testing for a
    media broadcast and that CBC would report the results of Trent’s testing on the
    broadcast. Trent placed no restrictions on what use CBC could make of its test
    results.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trent knew that the Subway samples it obtained,
    tested and reported on were Subway products. A Trent representative accompanied
    CBC’s representative to purchase chicken sandwiches from a Subway restaurant,
    and purchased additional sandwiches, without CBC, in order to test them.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After Trent provided CBC with its testing
    results, CBC advised Subway that an accredited lab had conducted testing that
    showed Subway’s chicken sandwiches were 50% soy. It does not appear that Subway
    was aware that the lab was Trent. Subway’s response to CBC was that its chicken
    sandwiches contained 1% or less soy, and CBC relayed this response to Trent.
    Trent advised CBC that Subway’s claim was not reasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trent employees appeared on the broadcast to
    discuss the results of their testing.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Motion Below</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted above, Subway’s action against Trent
    asserted two causes of action, defamation and negligence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trent did not move, as CBC did, under s. 137.1
    of the <em>CJA</em>, to dismiss Subway’s action against it for defamation. It
    did so only in respect of the negligence claim. Accordingly, the action for
    defamation against Trent will continue, regardless of the fate, under s. 137.1
    of the <em>CJA</em>, of the negligence cause of action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trent moved to dismiss the negligence claim on
    the basis that it arose from an expression by Trent on a matter related to the
    public interest, and that Subway could not meet the burden that falls upon the
    plaintiff advancing such a claim to avoid it being dismissed. That burden,
    under s. 137.1(4) of the <em>CJA</em>, has a merits component (the existence of
    grounds to believe the action has substantial merit and that the defendant
    lacks a valid defence) and a public interest component (grounds to believe the
    public interest in allowing the claim to continue outweighs the public interest
    in protecting the expression).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is important to appreciate what was and was
    not in issue on Trent’s s. 137.1 motion below, in order to appreciate the
    issues on this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, Trent’s motion to dismiss the negligence
    claim under s. 137.1 was a targeted one, in the sense that it only put in issue
    a subset of the matters that could be raised on such a motion. Clearly in issue
    was the threshold requirement as to whether the negligence claim arose from an
    expression related to a matter of public interest. But if the motion passed
    that hurdle, Trent relied on limited grounds to dispute Subway’s position that
    the negligence claim should be allowed to continue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Specifically, Trent disputed that the negligence
    claim passed the substantial merit hurdle under s. 137.1(4) only on the bases that
    no duty of care was owed to Subway and that the negligence claim was
    impermissible because it was a “dressed-up” defamation claim. Trent expressly
    did not contest that Subway could satisfy the court, for the purpose of the s.
    137.1 <em>CJA</em> motion, that Trent’s testing was inaccurate and fell below
    the standard of care of a testing laboratory. Trent led no evidence to
    challenge Subway’s on this issue. Nor did Trent contest that Subway could show
    that Trent otherwise had no valid defence to the negligence claim, <i>assuming</i> Trent owed a duty of care to Subway and that a negligence action was
    permissible.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[3]</span></span></span></a> Additionally, Trent did not contest that Subway could satisfy the public
    interest hurdle; it conceded that the harm sustained by Subway outweighed the
    public interest in protecting the expression.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, Subway did not contest that the subject
    of the <em>Marketplace</em><i> </i>broadcast, namely the chicken content of
    sandwiches sold by Subway and other fast food chains, relates to a matter of
    public interest. However, the parties did not agree about the effect of this as
    it related to the applicability of s. 137.1 of the <em>CJA</em> to the
    negligence claim against Trent.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Motion Judge’s Decision</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge dismissed Trent’s s. 137.1
    motion. His primary reason was his finding that Trent did not satisfy the
    initial threshold for such a motion, which required Trent to show that the
    proceeding sought to be dismissed arose from an expression made by the
    defendant that relates to a matter of public interest: s. 137.1(3). He held
    that, insofar as Subway’s claim against Trent was for negligence, the claim was
    not one that arose from an expression; the action for negligence was about the
    quality of Trent’s laboratory testing, standards, and methodology, not the
    reporting of the results.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Since<b> </b>Trent’s motion did not satisfy the
    initial threshold, its motion to dismiss the negligence claim had to fail. The
    motion judge observed that it was not strictly necessary to go on to consider
    whether Subway satisfied the factors under s. 137.1(4)(a) and (b) that allow a
    proceeding to continue even if it arose from an expression related to a matter
    of public interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the motion judge did briefly comment on
    the substantial merit issue. He reviewed the arguments about Subway’s
    negligence claim, including whether a negligence claim is permissible if there
    is a concurrent defamation claim, and whether Trent owed a duty of care to
    Subway that could support a negligence claim. He observed that case law had
    been cited supporting both sides’ positions on these issues and that the law
    concerning duty of care was “in a state of flux”. He referred to the standard
    that would have applied had Trent moved to strike the negligence claim under r.
    21 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>—whether the claim was arguable—and
    he drew from this that uncertainty alone is a reason not to dismiss a claim at
    a preliminary stage. He concluded that the negligence claim “had sufficient
    merit to sustain it at this stage”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although Trent did not contest that Subway
    satisfied the other s. 137.1(4) criteria, the motion judge briefly addressed
    them. He noted that Trent had put forward no evidence of a valid defence of its
    laboratory methodology, and that “[t]he balance of harm is in Subway’s favour
    since there is nothing to balance its evidence against. There is no public
    interest in the s. 137.1 sense in the way that Trent conducted its lab tests,
    and so any evidence of harm suffered by Subway is more than sufficient for
    present purposes. To put it simply, anything outweighs nothing.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the question of costs, the motion judge recognized
    that if a motion under s. 137.1 fails, the presumptive rule is no costs, unless
    the judge considers a different order to be appropriate: s. 137.1(8). The
    motion judge exercised his discretion to depart from the presumptive rule and
    ordered Trent to pay Subway $222,000 in costs. He held that since Trent did not
    meet the “relatively low” threshold of showing the proceeding it sought to
    dismiss arose from an expression on a matter of public interest, the policies
    underlying s. 137.1 and its no costs provision were inapplicable.</span></p>

    one that Arises from an Expression that Relates to a Matter of Public Interest?</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The gateway to s. 137.1 is the requirement, in
    s. 137.1(3), that the defendant show that the proceeding against it arises from
    an expression it made that relates to a matter of public interest. The
    provisions that contemplate dismissal of the proceeding unless the plaintiff
    satisfies certain criteria are not engaged unless this threshold requirement is
    met. “This is a threshold burden, which means that it is necessary for the
    moving party to meet this burden in order to even proceed to s. 137.1(4) for
    the ultimate determination of whether the proceeding should be dismissed”: <em>Pointes
    (SCC)</em>, at para. 21.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The role played by the threshold requirement is
    easily understood in light of the purposes set out in s. 137.1(1). These
    include the encouragement of persons to express themselves on matters of public
    interest, and the discouragement of the use of litigation to unduly limit such
    expression. Where a defendant, on a motion under s. 137.1, meets the threshold
    requirement, it has shown two things: (i) the proceeding arose from the
    defendant having done what the law seeks to encourage—express itself on a
    matter of public interest, and (ii) the proceeding might be litigation being
    used to unduly limit such expression.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>But if the defendant does not meet the threshold
    requirement, because it does not show that the claim arises from such an
    expression, none of the purposes enumerated in s. 137.1(1) are engaged. The
    provisions requiring dismissal of the proceeding, unless the plaintiff can
    satisfy the criteria set out in s. 137.1(4)(a) and (b), are inapplicable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Most cases to date that have involved
    significant disputes about whether the threshold requirement was met have been
    about whether the <em>content</em> of the expression from which the proceeding
    arose related to a matter of public interest. Here, the primary issue is about
    whether the proceeding <em>arose from an expression</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge did not view the negligence
    claim as having arisen from an expression, as he considered s. 137.1 to be
    aimed at what he called “expressive torts”, like defamation, not other types of
    wrongdoing. He stated that “<span style='color:black;background:white'>the
    terms of&nbsp;</span>s. 137.1<span style='color:black;background:white'> of the </span><em>CJA</em><span style='color:black;background:white'> are an awkward
    fit for claims which are framed other than in defamation-related torts such as
    libel and slander. The legislative purpose is to protect free and democratic
    expression, not conduct at large, and the statute is correspondingly designed
    to address expressive torts, not wrongdoing at large”. He distinguished the
    claim made against Trent for defamation for publishing inaccurate test results,
    from the negligence claim which he viewed as focussed on holding “the
    laboratory to the appropriate scientific and professional standard”, not on
    whether or how they published the results. The “site” of the negligence claim
    was how Trent performed its testing, not the way the results were communicated.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trent argues that the motion judge erred in
    coming to this conclusion. It submits that s. 137.1 is not limited to
    defamation claims, and that an expression is an integral part of this
    negligence claim. A successful action in negligence requires the plaintiff to
    show, among other things, that it was owed a duty of care, that the defendant breached
    the duty, and that the plaintiff sustained damages. It was only the
    communication or expression of the test results, by Trent to CBC, and by CBC
    and Trent personnel on the <i>Marketplace</i> broadcast to a viewing audience,
    that caused any damage to Subway and thus crystallized the claim. Unpublished
    research cannot give rise to a claim by the subject of the research as no
    damages can flow from unpublished negligent research: <em>Fulton v. Globe &amp;
    Mail</em> (1997), 207 A.R. 374 (Alta. Q.B.), at paras. 18-19.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Subway, on the other hand, argues that it is not
    sufficient, for a claim to meet the threshold requirement, that it involve some
    expressive content. To so hold would sweep many types of claim within the
    anti-SLAPP provisions which, Subway submits, were not intended to be covered.
    Expression must be the gravamen of the claim. The gravamen of this negligence
    claim, it submits, is not an expression but how Trent conducted the testing.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black;background:white'>I agree
    with Trent that the motion judge erred in reaching the conclusion that the
    claim in negligence did not arise from an expression that related to a matter
    of public interest. It was an error of law to view s. 137.1 as aimed at a
    limited category of torts like defamation. It was also an error of law not to
    appreciate the centrality of expression to this negligence claim.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black;background:white'>In </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Pointes</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black;background:
white'>, the claim was not for defamation; it alleged that the defendant had
    breached a contract by making certain statements and offering certain opinions
    at an Ontario Municipal Board hearing. Section 137.1 was held to apply to that
    claim. As this court explained in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Pointes (ONCA)</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black;background:white'>, the requirement that the
    proceeding arise from an expression is met where the expression “grounds” the
    claim. Putting it another way, this court considered the requirement to have
    been met because the claim “targets” the expression: at paras. 52, 103.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Pointes (SCC)</em>, </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:#212121'>Côté</span><span lang=EN-CA> J. discussed the
    proper approach to determine when a proceeding “arises from” an expression:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Second, what does “arises from” require? By
    definition, “arises from” implies an element of causality. In other words, if a
    proceeding “arises from” an expression, this must mean that the expression is
    somehow causally related to the proceeding.&nbsp;What is crucial is that many
    different types of proceedings can arise from an expression, and the
    legislative background of s.&nbsp;137.1 indicates that a broad and liberal
    interpretation is warranted at the s.&nbsp;137.1(3) stage of the framework.
    This means that proceedings arising from an expression are not limited to
    those&nbsp;directly&nbsp;concerned with expression, such as defamation suits. A
    good example of a type of proceeding that is not a defamation suit, but that
    nonetheless arises from an expression and falls within the ambit of
    s.&nbsp;137.1(3), is the underlying proceeding here, which is a breach of
    contract claim premised on an expression made by the defendant [Footnote
    omitted.]: at para. 24. </span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>Returning later in her reasons to the
    precise claim in <em>Pointes (SCC)</em>, </span><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%;color:#212121'>Côté</span><span lang=EN-CA> J. found it
    to pass the threshold because: “It is a breach of contract action premised on
    an alleged breach of the Agreement resulting from Mr. Gagnon’s testimony at the
    OMB. There is thus a clear nexus between Mr. Gagnon’s expression and the
    underlying proceeding”: at para. 102.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The negligence claim here arises from an
    expression, in the sense described both by this court and by the Supreme Court
    in <em>Pointes</em>. The expression is causally connected to the claim; there
    is a nexus between them; the expression grounds the claim; and the claim
    targets the expression. The expression or communication of or about the test
    results is integral to all aspects of Subway’s negligence claim: the existence
    of a duty of care, whether the duty was breached, and damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In pleading that Trent owed it a duty of care,
    Subway alleges that Trent knew that its testing was being conducted “<u>for the
    purpose of broadcasting conclusions about [Subway’s] products</u>” (emphasis
    added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In pleading that Trent breached its duty to
    Subway, Subway pleads that Trent knew or ought to have known that its <u>“[t]ests
    would be reported and/or relied on</u>”, that “<u>Trent reported conclusions to
    CBC</u> that were materially different from the conclusions it made”, that
    Trent’s results “<u>did not support the conclusions reported to the CBC</u>” or
    the viewing audience, and that “<u>test results were not explained with the
    appropriate caveats to CBC</u>” or the viewing audience (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In pleading damages, Subway alleges that Trent’s
    “<u>carrying out the testing of SUBWAY® products and/or making statements to
    the CBC</u>”, caused damage to their reputation and brand (emphasis added). No
    basis is suggested on which Subway is said to have suffered damages from
    Trent’s testing, other than by virtue of communication of or about the results.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although in important ways the negligence action
    is concerned with the quality of Trent’s testing, in equally important and
    fundamental ways it is concerned with Trent’s knowledge that it was doing the
    testing to provide information to be broadcast; it is concerned with what Trent
    communicated about its tests; and it is concerned with the harm that resulted
    from the communication of, about, and based on, its test results. That is
    sufficient to satisfy the initial threshold of being a claim that arises out of
    an expression. A claim in an action that complains about these matters falls
    within the category of litigation that could unduly limit such expression.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Subway further argues that even if the claim
    arose from an expression, the expression did not relate to a matter of public
    interest because Trent’s testing was of the DNA content of the sandwiches, in
    which the public would have no interest. I reject that argument. The very
    essence of Subway’s claim is that the purpose of Trent’s testing was for it to
    be the basis of conclusions that would be broadcast about the chicken content
    of sandwiches sold by Subway and certain of its competitors, and that this is
    what occurred. That is the very matter the motion judge found to be, and that
    Subway does not contest is, a matter of public interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the motion judge erred in finding
    that Trent’s motion did not pass the initial threshold requirement. Contrary to
    the motion judge’s conclusion, the negligence claim had to be dismissed unless
    Subway satisfied the relevant criteria in s. 137.1(4) of the <em>CJA</em>. I

    rejecting that argument, the Supreme Court stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The possibility of suing in defamation does
    not negate the availability of a cause of action in negligence where the
    necessary elements are made out. Freedom of expression and the policies
    underlying qualified privilege can be taken into account in determining the
    appropriate standard of care in negligence. …There is no reason in principle
    why negligence actions should not be allowed to proceed where (a)&nbsp;proximity
    and foreseeability have been established, and (b)&nbsp;the damages cover more
    than just harm to the plaintiff’s reputation (i.e.&nbsp;where there are further
    damages arising from the defendant’s negligence): at paras. 55-56.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    test laid down in <em>Bella</em> that must be met for a negligence claim to be
    permissible in this sort of circumstance, and Subway meets neither. The first
    is the existence of a duty of care. The second is the existence of damages that
    cover more than just harm to the plaintiff’s reputation.</span></p>

    for harm to reputation, depreciation of goodwill and value of trademarks, loss
    of sales, expenses to defend legal proceedings (class actions) that were
    brought against Subway as a result of the broadcast, and expenses of mitigation.
    Although the damages go beyond harm to reputation, Trent interprets the second
    prong of <em>Bella</em> to mean that the damages claimed for negligence must go
    beyond any that can be claimed in a defamation action. Since, in a defamation
    action, consequential financial losses may be claimed, Trent argues that there
    is nothing claimed by Subway in this action that meets the second prong in <em>Bella</em>.</span></p>

    damages, such as aggravated damages, punitive damages, and special damages. Special
    damages can include loss of business caused by the defamation. Unlike an award

    because the first prong in <em>Bella</em>, the existence of a duty of care, was
    not shown. The decision does not say that if a duty of care had existed, the fact
    that consequential financial losses can be claimed in a defamation action meant

    for negligence in preparing and disseminating a research report on a company’s
    activities, under both prongs of the <em>Bella</em> test. On the first prong,
    it held, at para. 24, that a duty of care had not been adequately asserted. On
    the second prong, the court stated that “it appears from the pleading that the
    plaintiff claims the same damages under its negligence claim as it does for
    defamation. Other than a claim for damages for loss to reputation, there is
    simply a bald pleading of ‘foreseeable damages’ or ‘other damages’ which is not

    incorrectly identified as a purse snatcher on a website. The plaintiff alleged
    that same publication to be defamatory. In discussing the second prong and what
    the plaintiff would have to show at trial, the court stated: “With respect to
    negligence, the plaintiff has the burden of proving all of the elements
    necessary to a successful negligence claim including liability and damages. She
    has the additional burden of demonstrating that the negligence claim is not
    just a defamation action ‘dressed up’. That requires her to prove a causal link

    economic loss, that is, “</span><span lang=EN-CA>economic loss that is
    unconnected to a physical or mental injury to the plaintiff’s person, or to
    physical damage to property”: <em>1688782 Ontario Inc. v Maple Leaf Foods Inc.</em>,

    set out in <em>Deloitte &amp; Touche v. Livent Inc. (Receiver of)</em>, 2017
    SCC 63, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 855, and in <em>Maple Leaf</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    extent of a duty of care in a claim for pure economic loss is the modified <em>Anns/Cooper</em> test. It addresses the question of whether a duty of care exists in two stages;

    whether residual policy considerations should negate or limit the <em>prima</em> <em>facie</em> duty.</span><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> </span><span lang=EN-CA>At the first stage the court considers: (i) proximity,
    namely, whether the parties are in such a close and direct relationship that it

    of harm, namely, whether an injury to the plaintiff was a reasonably
    foreseeable consequence of negligence of the defendant. At the second stage the
    court considers whether, despite the proximity of the relationship and reasonably
    foreseeable quality of the plaintiff’s injury, the defendant should nonetheless

    economic loss case, and provide authoritative guidance on how that is to be
    done. </span><span lang=EN-CA>As the majority in <em>Maple Leaf</em><i> <em>(SCC)</em></i> observed, <em>Livent</em> not only “</span><span lang=EN-CA>restated the
    analytical framework governing cases of negligent misrepresentation or
    performance of a service” to take into account the importance of proximity, but
    did so in a way that has implications for all pure economic loss cases, not
    just those styled as claims for negligent misrepresentation or performance of a
    service: at paras. 29-30. In <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>, the majority further
    elucidated that analytical framework as it applied to cases of negligent
    misrepresentation or performance of a service, and described the framework to
    be used in cases involving the supply of shoddy goods, to better account for
    the “requisite element of proximity”: at paras. 41, 60.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In doing so, the court reiterated three
    fundamental, inter-related, points.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, proximity is distinct from reasonable
    foreseeability of harm. Parties are not in a proximate relationship simply
    because it is reasonably foreseeable that carelessness by one will harm the
    other economically. “[T]he defendant’s ability to reasonably foresee injury to
    a plaintiff is insufficient to ground a finding of proximity”: <em>Maple Leaf
    (SCC)</em>, at para. 84.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the proximity analysis takes place
    against the backdrop of the fundamental principle that a plaintiff must have a
    right, or legally cognizable interest, that would be vindicated by recognizing
    a duty of care on the part of the defendant. This is particularly important in
    cases of pure economic loss because there “is no general right, in tort,
    protecting against the negligent or intentional infliction of pure economic
    loss”. The loss to be recovered must be “the result of an interference with a
    legally cognizable right”: <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>, at paras. 18-19.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the proper identification and assessment
    of all relevant factors arising from the relationship between the parties, in
    order to determine whether their relationship can truly be called proximate,
    furnishes a “principled basis” to determine to whom duties are owed and to whom
    they are not, as well as the scope of the duties: <em>Livent</em>, at para 31.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Livent</em>, two routes to establishing
    proximity were discussed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first route is where a party seeks to base a
    finding of proximity upon a category established by prior case law to be
    proximate, or a category analogous thereto: at para. 28. “If a relationship
    falls within a previously established category, or is analogous to one, then
    the requisite close and direct relationship is shown”: at para. 26.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, both in and after <em>Livent</em>,
    stress has been placed on the importance of “cautio[n] in finding proximity
    based on a previously established or analogous category”, since there is a need
    to examine “the particular relationship at issue in each case”: <em>1688782
    Ontario Inc. v Maple Leaf Foods Inc.</em>, 2018 ONCA 407, 140 O.R. (3d) 481, at
    para. 50, aff’d 2020 SCC 35. “[A] court should be attentive to the particular
    factors which justified recognizing that prior category in order to determine
    whether the relationship at issue is, in fact, <span class=Underline>truly</span> the same as or analogous to that which was previously recognized” (emphasis
    added): <em>Livent</em>, at para. 28. “Ultimately, then, to ground an analogous
    duty, the case authorities relied upon by the [plaintiff] must be shown to
    arise from <span class=Underline>an analogous relationship and analogous
    circumstances</span>” (emphasis added): <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>, at para. 65.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second route to establishing proximity is
    where a previously established or analogous proximate relationship cannot be
    found. In such cases:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>courts must undertake a full proximity
    analysis. To determine whether the “‘close and direct’ relationship which is
    the hallmark of the common law duty of care” exists, courts must examine all
    relevant “factors arising from the relationship between the plaintiff and the
    defendant”. While these factors are diverse and depend on the circumstances of
    each case, this Court has maintained that they include “expectations,
    representations, reliance, and the property or other interests involved” as
    well as any statutory obligations [Citations omitted.]: <em>Livent</em>, at
    para. 29. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>But the search for a novel duty of care through
    the full proximity analysis is not completely open-ended. It must be conducted
    taking into account the<i> </i>principles that inform a proper duty of care
    analysis in the area of pure economic loss, and the factors applicable to the
    type of case under consideration: <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>, at para. 95.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Categories of proximate relationships—be they
    established, analogous, or novel—are not to be confused with categories of the
    types of cases in which pure economic losses can arise. In <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>,
    the current categories of the types of cases in which pure economic loss can
    arise between private parties were described as: (i) negligent misrepresentation
    or performance of a service; (ii) negligent supply of shoddy goods or
    structures; and (iii) relational economic loss.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These categories of the types of cases in which pure
    economic losses can arise are analytical tools only. Arguing that a loss
    occurred in one of these ways—that is, invoking one of the categories of types
    of cases—does not show that a relationship of proximity exists. It does not, by
    itself, substitute for an examination of the particular relationship in issue
    in each case between the plaintiff and the defendant. Instead, “what matters is
    whether the requirements for imposing a duty of care are satisfied—and, in
    particular, whether the parties were at the time of the loss in a sufficiently
    proximate relationship”: <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>, at paras. 20-23.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nevertheless, the category of pure economic loss
    that is alleged can inform the proximity analysis. In <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>,
    the court explained that “[w]hether a proximate relationship exists between two
    parties at large, or inheres only for particular purposes or in relation to
    particular actions, will depend on the nature of the relationships at issue … <span
class=Underline>It may also depend on the nature of the particular kind of pure
    economic loss alleged</span>” (emphasis added): at para. 30.</span></p>

    factors were identified that are determinative to finding proximity when the
    “kind of pure economic loss alleged” is negligent misrepresentation or
    performance of a service. In <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>, the court also reviewed
    the factors necessary to determining proximity for cases in the category of
    negligent supply of shoddy structures or goods.</span></p>

    Inc. (Receiver of)</em> together, then, this Court has emphasized the
    requirement of proximity within the duty analysis, and has tied that
    requirement in cases of negligent misrepresentation or performance of a service
    to the defendant’s undertaking of responsibility and its inducement of
    reasonable and detrimental reliance in the plaintiff. Framing the analysis in
    this manner also illuminates the legal interest being protected and, therefore,
    the right sought to be vindicated by such claims. When a defendant undertakes
    to represent a state of affairs or to otherwise do something, it assumes the
    task of doing so reasonably, thereby manifesting an intention to induce the
    plaintiff’s reliance upon the defendant’s exercise of reasonable care in
    carrying out the task. And where the inducement has that intended effect </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:"Tahoma",sans-serif'>&#11834;</span><span
lang=EN-CA> that is, where the plaintiff reasonably relies, it alters its
    position, possibly foregoing alternative and more beneficial courses of action
    that were available at the time of the inducement. That is, the plaintiff may
    show that the defendant’s inducement caused the plaintiff to relinquish its pre&#8209;reliance
    position and suffer economic detriment as a consequence.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In other words, it is<span
class=apple-converted-space> </span>the intended effect<span
class=apple-converted-space> </span>of the defendant’s undertaking upon the
    plaintiff’s autonomy that brings the defendant into a relationship of
    proximity, and therefore of duty, with the plaintiff. Where that effect works
    to the plaintiff’s detriment, it is a wrong to the plaintiff. Having
    deliberately solicited the plaintiff’s reliance as a reasonable response, the
    defendant cannot in justice disclaim responsibility for any economic loss that
    the plaintiff can show was caused by such reliance. The plaintiff’s pre&#8209;reliance
    circumstance has become “an entitlement that runs against the defendant”
    (Weinrib, at p.&nbsp;230).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    (SCC)</em> makes two additional points about the centrality, to the analysis of
    proximity in a negligent misrepresentation or performance of a service case, of
    the defendant’s undertaking of responsibility and the plaintiff’s reliance.
    First, it is not sufficient that the defendant gave an undertaking; it is
    important to whom the undertaking was given. It must have been in favour of the
    plaintiff: at paras. 38-39. Second, reliance must be by the plaintiff,
    represented by a change in position that the plaintiff actually made from an
    alternative course it was otherwise free to pursue. The plaintiff cannot
    substitute reliance, by others, on something the defendant said or did, even if
    the reliance by others detrimentally affected the plaintiff: at paras. 39-40.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> also establishes that, for claims in the category of negligent
    supply of shoddy goods or structures, the duty of care is correlative to “a
    right to be free of a negligently caused real and substantial danger” to person
    or property. An economic loss sustained to avoid a negligently created real and
    substantial danger to person or property is treated, in the eyes of the law, as
    interference with the plaintiff’s right in person or property: at paras. 41-48,
    54. The nature of the right at stake is important to the proximity analysis in
    several ways, including distinguishing cases that are truly analogous from ones
    that are not, as well as informing the analysis of when a novel duty should be
    recognized: at paras. 65, 73, 77, 79, 82 and 95.</span></p>

    inform the proximity analysis, it is important to consider what type of claim
    Subway is making. Subway alleges that its loss occurred because Trent was
    careless in performing a service—testing Subway’s products—and that Trent’s
    carelessness in testing led it and CBC to make false statements about those
    products, thereby affecting consumer behaviour and causing Subway’s pure
    economic loss.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Subway has not taken the position that its case
    falls into the category of negligent misrepresentation or performance of a
    service (or any other of the current categories that describe how pure economic
    loss occurs). It maintains that neither it, nor Trent, have sought to
    categorize its claim this way. It argues, therefore, that its argument for
    proximity based on an analogous category of proximate relationship, or a novel
    duty, may be approached without reference to the specific and determinative
    factors applicable to claims within this category.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The category or analytical tool to be used to
    assist in determining the proximity question is not dependent on what a party
    calls its claim, but on what the claim really is. For example, in <em>Lavender
    v. Miller Bernstein LLP</em>, 2018 ONCA 729, 142 O.R. (3d) 401, leave to appeal
    refused, [2018] S.C.C.A. No. 488, the plaintiff called its claim one for
    negligence simpliciter. But this court took into account what was required in a
    claim within the category of negligent misrepresentation or performance of a
    service to conclude that, on the facts, the absence of an undertaking or
    reliance precluded a finding of proximity: at paras. 65-67, 73.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nevertheless, I agree with Subway that a claim
    for pure economic loss may fall outside the three categories, not only in name
    but in substance. But even for such a claim, it is necessary to give effect to
    the implications of the framework in <em>Livent </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>and</span></em><em> Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>. That
    framework and its particular emphasis on what is necessary to find proximity and
    why, follows from the basic proposition that there is no right to be free of
    negligently caused pure economic loss absent interference with a legally
    cognizable right.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Subway’s negligence claim has certain attributes
    similar to a claim in the category of one for pure economic loss that came
    about through negligent misrepresentation or performance of a service. At its
    core, it alleges that Trent carelessly performed a service—testing—and
    carelessly communicated its faulty results.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>But totally missing are what would be the determinative elements to
    establish proximity for a claim within the negligent misrepresentation or
    performance of a service category—an undertaking of responsibility by Trent in
    favour of Subway, and reliance by Subway: <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>, at paras.
    32-34; <em>Livent</em>, at para. 30.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Here, Trent gave no express undertaking to Subway. The only express
    undertaking Trent gave to conduct testing was to CBC. Subway does not point to
    anything that would support an implication of an undertaking of responsibility <em>in
    its favour.</em> Given that the undertaking of responsibility must be such as
    to deliberately invite reliance—a change of position—by the person in whose
    favour the undertaking is given, nothing suggests Trent gave any such undertaking.
    The testing Trent performed and statements it made are not suggested to have
    been intended to induce Subway to change its position, or to do anything at
    all.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Subway does not contend that it relied on Trent’s services or
    statements. Subway was not induced to, and did not change its position, in
    reliance upon any undertaking of Trent. Subway disagreed with and challenged
    Trent’s testing results as soon as it learned of them—it did the opposite of
    relying on them. As <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em> holds, the fact that consumers rely
    on what the defendant did or said, does not, within this category of claim, fill
    the gap created by the plaintiff’s own non-reliance: at paras. 38-39.</span></p>

    right and justify the correlative duty. Neither is present in this case. Nor,
    like a case in the shoddy goods category, does Subway’s claim seek to impose a
    duty correlative to what is seen, in the eyes of the law, as a legally
    cognizable right in person or property. These absences must be borne in mind
    when assessing whether Subway can establish proximity for its negligence claim through
    either of the two routes it argues for, analogous relationship or novel proximate

lang=EN-CA>The bases on which a proximate relationship was found in these cases
    does not support the requisite analogy to the relationship at issue in this
    case. Significantly, none of these cases involved a claim for pure economic
    loss. In <em>Cleveland</em>, the claim for damages related to delayed diagnosis
    of a congenital order, which deprived the plaintiff of the opportunity to
    receive proper treatment: at para. 5. In <em>Green</em>, it related to, among
    other things, pain and suffering and loss of custody of the plaintiff’s child:
    at para. 111. In <em>Bertin and Neufville</em>, both of which pre-date the
    Supreme Court’s decision in <a name="_Hlk57958027"><em>Cooper v. Hobart</em>,
    2001 SCC 79, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537</a>, the claims were related to, respectively,
    pain and disfigurement, and death: <em>Bertin</em>, at para. 26; <em>Neufville</em>,
    at para. 1.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Distinguishing these cases based on the nature of the loss at issue
    is necessary, given the different framework for assessing proximity in claims
    of pure economic loss: “such claims warrant more rigorous examination than in
    other claims for negligence”: <em>Lavender</em>, at para. 72. In <em>Maple
    Leaf,</em> the Supreme Court rejected an argument that proximity could be
    established by analogy to certain previously decided cases, in part, because
    those cases involved “actual physical damage, such that the resulting economic
    losses were not, as a matter of law, pure economic loss but consequential
    economic loss”: at paras. 77-79. The nature of the right at stake is relevant
    to distinguishing cases that are truly analogous from ones that are not.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Moreover, <em>Cleveland</em>, <em>Green</em>, <em>Bertin</em> and <em>Neufville</em> involved, among other things, requests to the laboratory for testing by the
    plaintiff or someone serving the plaintiff’s interests, where the results of
    the testing would be used to determine a course of treatment or some other
    intervention in the plaintiff’s life. The distinct nature of the undertaking,
    expectations, reliance, and heightened interests at stake in these cases are
    different enough to overwhelm any similarities to the case at bar.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Subway cites <em>Lowe v. Guarantee Co. of North America</em> (2005),
    80 O.R. (3d) 222 (C.A.), in which this court refused to strike a claim against
    health professionals who prepared a medical opinion about an insured for the
    purpose of determining entitlements to statutory accident benefits from the
    insurer. The health professionals were part of a statutorily prescribed
    Designated Assessment Centre, put in place for use by insureds and insurers to
    obtain neutral third-party opinions, which served as preliminary determinations
    of the insured’s entitlement. In holding that it was not plain and obvious that
    no prima facie duty of competence to the insured was owed the court relied on
    the “legislatively created decision-making function” with consequences for both
    insurers and insureds, to find an arguable relationship of proximity between
    the health professionals and the persons assessed: at paras. 11, 39, 47-49.</span></p>

    a physician who, at the request of an insurer and with the consent of the
    plaintiff/insured, conducted an independent medical examination of the
    plaintiff’s medical records and provided an opinion to the insurer which it
    relied on to deny the plaintiff’s claim for disability benefits, was found to

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>In my view, neither <em>Lowe</em> nor <em>Rubens</em> are truly
    analogous to this case. First, there is the absence here of a legislative
    scheme, like the one in <em>Lowe</em>, that the court relied upon as an
    important factor to find arguable proximity. As the court noted in <em>Livent</em>,
    statutory obligations can be important to whether a relationship of proximity
    exists: at para. 29. Second, in <em>Rubens</em>, the plaintiff had a
    pre-existing legal relationship with the insurer under a contract of insurance;
    the insurer appointed the physician to review medial records to evaluate a
    claim under the contract by the insured, and the insured consented. The
    relationship, expectations and interests stand in contrast to the circumstances
    of this case, where nothing similar is present. Moreover, the court in <em>Rubens</em>,
    which did not have the benefit of <em>Livent</em> or <em>Maple Leaf</em>,

    this court refused to strike a claim asserting that credit reporting agencies,
    who investigated the credit of consumers and made reports to credit granting
    entities, owed a duty of care to the consumers who were the subjects of their
    reports, even though it was the credit granting entities, not the consumers,
    who relied on the reports to grant or deny credit to the consumers. The court
    found the relationship of proximity could be supported on two bases: as a
    category of relationship analogous to that underlying the category of negligent
    misrepresentation (negligent misrepresentation without reliance by the
    plaintiff) or as a new category: at paras. 33-41.</span></p>

    proximity in a claim within the category of negligent misrepresentation, when
    there has been no reliance by the plaintiff. Moreover, the comment in <em>Haskett</em><i> </i>that the claim may be in a new category (a seeming reference to a category

    to investigate workplace thefts. The court allowed the claim by an employee,
    who was wrongly identified as a culprit, discharged from employment, criminally
    charged (without further independent investigation by the police) and briefly
    jailed, to proceed to trial. The court reasoned that as the police owe a duty

    employer, that the latter relied upon in deciding not to hire the plaintiff.
    The court found that the former employer owed a duty of care in providing the
    reference. One of the judges for the majority held that the source of the duty
    lay in “an assumption of responsibility by the [former employer] to the
    plaintiff in respect of the reference, and reliance by the plaintiff upon the
    exercise by [the former employer] of due care and skill in respect of its
    preparation”: at p. 143, per Lord Goff. As explained above, there is no such
    undertaking or reliance in the instant case. The plaintiff and defendant in <em>Spring</em> were also in a prior contractual relationship, and rules of a self-regulatory
    body, to which the prospective and former employer belonged, required that the
    prospective employer obtain, and the former employer to provide, references

    2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640. Teitel did contact and interview Roberts, and
    Maddocks contacted him to check the accuracy of some of his statements. But to
    say, as the plaintiffs have, that these contacts by themselves gave rise to a
    duty of care would mean that in virtually every case a plaintiff could proceed
    with a negligence claim as well as a defamation claim. The principle in <em>Young

    report. Subway does not contend that CBC owed it a duty of care by virtue of
    investigating the story, sufficient to support a claim against CBC in

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Subway submits that even if a relationship of proximity cannot be
    established by analogy to a previously recognized one, a novel proximate
    relationship should be recognized based on a full proximity analysis. I am
    unable to accept that Subway has a real prospect of success on this contention.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Subway’s argument for proximity must establish a relationship that
    would take its case beyond an assertion that it was simply entitled to be
    protected from pure economic loss caused by negligence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I reiterate what Subway points to in support of the argument that a
    full proximity analysis reveals a relationship of proximity. Trent was not
    doing academic research, but was hired by CBC to do testing and expected
    payment from CBC for it. Trent purchased Subway chicken sandwiches it tested
    from a Subway restaurant. Trent knew whose products it was testing. It knew CBC
    would report the results of Trent’s tests. Trent was provided with Subway’s
    response to the test results through CBC, and told CBC that Subway’s
    response—that disagreed with the results of Trent’s tests about the content of
    its product—was unreasonable. Trent placed no restrictions on how its test
    results could be used, and Trent representatives appeared on the <em>Marketplace</em> broadcast to discuss the test results.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, these circumstances speak to the foreseeability of harm
    that would arise if Trent did its work, or reported on it, carelessly. But that
    is not the proximity question. Proximity is a “distinct and more demanding
    hurdle than reasonable foreseeability”: <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>, at para. 62.
    A novel duty of care cannot be established based on the foreseeability of harm
    alone.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The constellation of factors to which Subway points are primarily
    about foreseeability of harm, not proximity. They do not show a close and direct
    relationship. They do not show any expectations, representations, reliance, or
    statutory obligations as between Trent and Subway. They do not show anything
    that fulfils the purpose served by the requirement for an undertaking and
    reliance in a negligent misrepresentation or performance of services case, that
    is, something that shows a legally cognizable right of the plaintiff is
    affected. Nor do they show interests affected akin to rights in person or
    property. Subway’s negligence claim is only about the pure economic harm it
    suffered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The application of the principles relating to proximity in a claim
    for pure economic loss prevent the recognition of a novel proximate
    relationship in this case. As the Supreme Court in <em>Maple Leaf</em> explained (concerning a claim within the category of supply of shoddy goods),
    at para. 95, “while a novel duty of care, being novel, starts with a blank
    slate, that slate is filled by applying the same <em>Anns/Cooper</em> framework
    that, as we have just explained, operates to preclude recovery here”.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In light of my conclusions, I need not address Trent’s argument that
    any <em>prima</em><i> <em>facie</em></i> duty of care that arose from the
    relationship of proximity and the reasonable foreseeability of loss is negated
    by residual policy concerns about the effect of recognizing the duty on other
    legal obligations, the legal system, or society generally: <em>Livent</em>, at
    para. 38.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The question of whether a duty of care is owed is a question of law,
    as are the components of the duty of care analysis, including the question of
    proximity: <em>Maple Leaf (SCC)</em>, at para. 24. Subway’s negligence claim
    lacks a real prospect of success. It is not legally tenable.</span></p>
