lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></strong></p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of sexual assault.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> At the end of counsel’s submissions, the court dismissed the appeal with
    reasons to follow. These are those reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary to go into the details of the evidence. This was
    essentially a two-witness case. The complainant testified she did not consent
    to sexual intercourse. The appellant testified the complainant consented and only
    told him to stop after he had ejaculated. The outcome at trial turned on the
    trial judge’s assessment of the credibility of the appellant and the
    complainant, and the proper application of the burden of proof to those
    credibility assessments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The trial judge’s reasons demonstrate he appreciated the
    issues, the position of the parties, the centrality of his credibility assessments,
    and the importance of the burden of proof. He structured his reasons to a large
    degree to track the submissions of trial counsel. He also specifically directed
    himself on the three-step approach set down in <em>R. v. W. (D.)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The trial judge began
    with a consideration of the appellant’s evidence. After a thorough review of
    that evidence, the trial judge said, at p. 13:</span></em></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Given all these contradictions, the testimony of the defendant
    cannot be believed. His testimony does not raise a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having completed steps one and two of <em>R. v. W.D.</em>, the trial
    judge moved to the third step which, on the evidence adduced in this case, turned
    entirely on his assessment of the credibility of the complainant. Once again, the
    trial judge thoroughly reviewed the evidence. He ultimately determined the
    complainant was credible and the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable
    doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant argues the reasons are so deficient as to constitute
    an error in law. In her oral submissions, counsel advanced three arguments in
    support of this submission. She claims the trial judge:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>summarized, but did not analyze the evidence and failed to make
    necessary findings of fact;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failed to address the argument that the complainant had a motive
    to fabricate her allegation; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>made a finding that the appellant admitted wrongdoing in a text
    message when that finding could not be justified on the totality of the
    relevant evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the appellant acknowledges, the trial judge did thoroughly review the
    evidence. The reasons did not, however, stop there. The trial judge provided
    cogent, detailed reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence and concluding
    it could not raise a reasonable doubt. Those reasons are supported by the
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also explained why he accepted the complainant’s
    evidence, albeit in a somewhat less detailed manner. In the course of reviewing
    the complainant’s evidence, the trial judge referred to and explained why he
    rejected various arguments that had been advanced on behalf of the appellant,
    challenging the complainant’s credibility.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, it was not necessary for the trial judge to make discrete
    findings of fact in relation to matters other than whether the sexual conduct
    was consensual. The trial judge’s credibility findings, which are adequately
    explained in his reasons, lead inevitably to a finding the complainant did not
    consent to sexual intercourse. On reading these reasons, there is no doubt why
    the trial judge convicted the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second submission arises out of the trial judge’s failure to deal with the
    defence argument that the complainant had a motive to fabricate an allegation
    of sexual assault against the appellant. The trial judge did not deal with this
    argument in his reasons. Given the credibility findings, however, it is
    implicit that the trial judge rejected the argument that the complainant
    decided to fabricate a false allegation of sexual assault to get the appellant
    out of her home.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge is not required to address each and every argument in the reasons
    for judgment. On the evidence adduced in this case, the argument the
    complainant fabricated the allegation of sexual assault to get the appellant
    out of her home, made little sense. She testified she called the police because
    she was physically afraid of the appellant and wanted him out of her home. When
    she called, she made no allegation of sexual assault and, on her evidence, did
    not intend to make any such allegation. The complainant first referenced the
    sexual assault when questioned by the police after they had arrived. The
    evidence concerning the manner in which the allegation of sexual assault was
    made to the police is not consistent with the complainant having formulated a
    plan to call the police and falsely accuse the appellant of sexual assault. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of her able submissions in this court, counsel suggested a variation
    on the argument put forward at trial. She suggested the complainant may have
    formulated the false allegation after the police arrived to buttress her
    request that the police remove the appellant from the home. This suggestion was
    not put to the complainant and does not appear to have been part of the defence
    theory at trial. It is not surprising the trial judge did not advert to this
    possibility in his reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final point deals with the trial judge’s treatment of a text exchange between
    the appellant and the complainant, during which the appellant appears to
    acknowledge prior wrongs done to the complainant. The appellant argues the
    trial judge took this as an admission by the appellant in respect of the sexual
    assault charge. He argues not even the complainant put that interpretation on
    the appellant’s text message.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not read the trial judge’s reasons as making a finding of an admission with
    respect to the specific events giving rise to this charge. Rather, he took the
    appellant’s words as an admission of having treated the complainant in an
    abusive manner. That admission was relevant both to whether the sexual
    intercourse was consensual, and the appellant’s credibility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary,
    the trial judge’s reasons adequately served their intended purposes. They
    explained why the trial judge reached the verdict he did, and they sufficiently
    exposed the trial judge’s reasoning to effective appellate review.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
