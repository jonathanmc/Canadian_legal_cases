    There, it hit a parked pickup truck. The force of the collision drove the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The vehicle returned to the road surface. Three
    people were inside. The driver. A front seat passenger. A rear seat passenger.
    The driver and front seat passenger suffered serious injuries. The front seat

lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lerrell Stennett (the appellant) was the driver
    of the vehicle. </span></p>

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Background Facts</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial proceedings consisted of a blended <i>voir
    dire </i>to determine the admissibility of an interview of the appellant by
    investigating officers; an Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASF”), which included a
    Collision Reconstruction Report and a Toxicology Letter of Opinion by qualified
    experts in each field; and the <i>viva voce </i>evidence of a qualified
    forensic toxicologist. The appellant did not testify or otherwise adduce
    evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In large measure, the circumstances underlying
    the offences with which the appellant was charged are uncontroversial. Their
    brief recital affords a sufficient frame for the decision that follows.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Nightclub</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the evening before the accident, the
    appellant drove to a birthday party for one of his brothers at a nightclub. He
    drove there in a rear-wheel drive Jaguar owned by another of his brothers. He
    had driven the car previously.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant had arranged for bottle service at
    the nightclub. This included a 1.5-litre bottle of vodka. The appellant did not
    plan to drink at the nightclub, but rather, as he explained to police when
    interviewed, he planned to get “lit” later. However, he acknowledged having had
    two shots, which he considered would have resulted in an “alert” reading if
    tested on an alcohol screening device.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Departure</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the birthday celebration came to a close, the
    appellant left the club with two others. One sat in the front passenger seat,
    the other in the rear passenger seat. The appellant was the driver.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The group stopped at a McDonald’s restaurant
    where one of the members got some water. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Accident Scene </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The accident occurred on a straight level
    stretch of Highway 7 at about four o’clock one mid-August morning. The road
    surface was paved with two lanes running in each east-west direction. There was
    no median or other obstruction on the road surface. The posted speed limit was
    60 km/h.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The road surface was wet at the time of the
    accident.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Accident </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the collision reconstructionist,
    the accident occurred when the appellant was driving west on Highway 7. The
    Jaguar rotated clockwise with its centre mass continuing in a westerly
    direction, but its front facing north. The rear tire on the passenger side
    struck the curb. The vehicle left the travelled surface of the highway and
    sheared off two light standards as it continued towards several vehicles parked
    on a used car lot.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The driver’s side of the appellant’s vehicle
    struck a truck parked on the used car lot on the north side of the highway. The
    force of the impact pushed the pickup truck into an adjacent vehicle parked in
    a line with several others. Four vehicles in this line were damaged in the
    chain reaction that followed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Jaguar continued to rotate clockwise after
    the chain reaction collisions in the used car lot. The vehicle continued south
    off the shoulder of the road until it finally came to rest in the westbound
    lanes of Highway 7, its original direction of travel.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Vehicle</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A post-accident examination of the Jaguar
    disclosed no pre-existing defect in its operating system or fittings. There was
    extensive damage to the driver’s side of the car. The front wheel was detached
    from the axle. The rear driver’s door was no longer attached. There was a
    cylindrical dent in the roof above the door. The driver’s airbag had deployed.
    Both front and side windows on the driver’s side had shattered.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Speed of the Vehicle</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Jaguar was not equipped with an Event Data
    Recorder (“EDR”). As a result, there was no record of any pre-accident
    information such as the speed of the vehicle before, at the time and after the
    various collisions. The vehicles parked on the used car lot and struck by the
    Jaguar or each other in the chain reaction that followed were not powered, thus
    their EDRs did not record any events in which they were involved. The collision
    reconstructionist was unable to calculate the pre-collision speed of the
    Jaguar.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his report, the collision reconstructionist
    wrote that wet roads can reduce the dynamic friction between the tire on a
    vehicle and the surface of the road. This can contribute to a loss of control
    if a vehicle is travelling at a speed that exceeds the available friction.
    Other factors that can contribute to a loss of control on wet conditions
    include steering input, a curve in the road, abrupt acceleration and braking.
    The reconstructionist was unable to determine which, if any, of these factors
    may have caused the Jaguar to enter a rotation.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Toxicology</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The accident occurred between 4:00 and 4:09 a.m.
    on August 20, 2016. Blood samples were taken from the appellant at hospital and
    later analyzed by forensic toxicologists at the Centre of Forensic Sciences.
    The projected blood alcohol concentration of the appellant at the time of the
    collision was 66-96 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Elizabeth Hird is a forensic toxicologist at the
    Centre of Forensic Sciences. She testified that impairment of driving ability
    due to alcohol consumption becomes significant at a blood alcohol concentration
    of 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and increases from
    that point as blood alcohol concentration increases. Impairment refers to a decreased
    ability to perform a complex task such as driving a motor vehicle. Intoxication
    refers to the physiological or observable effects alcohol has on a person.
    These effects may be less apparent in those with a tolerance for alcohol, but
    tolerance has no effect on impairment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Hird testified that the ability of a person
    with a blood alcohol concentration in the range of 66-96 milligrams of alcohol
    in 100 millilitres of blood to operate a motor vehicle would be impaired.
    Driving requires the use of several faculties almost simultaneously. Divided
    attention must be maintained. Judging speed and distance. Responding to unexpected
    events. Taking corrective action. The witness could not say whether a person
    with a blood alcohol concentration of 60 milligrams of alcohol in 100
    millilitres of blood who displayed no visible signs of intoxication could
    operate a vehicle safely. But she did say that the person’s ability to operate
    the vehicle would be decreased due to the complexity of the task and their
    decreased ability to perform that task well.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In cross-examination, Ms. Hird acknowledged that
    she could not say whether the appellant was impaired at a blood alcohol
    concentration because she had never tested him. Similarly, she could not
    express an opinion about where within the projected range of 66-96 milligrams
    of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood the appellant would have fallen at the
    time of the collision. However, she noted that the entire range was beyond 50
    milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood at which impairment
    generally becomes significant. She also testified that although she could not
    rule out a blood alcohol concentration at the lower end of that range, either
    generally or for the appellant in particular, she considered it more likely
    that a person would be at the higher end due to the average rates of
    elimination.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Signs of Impairment</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>No one reported having seen any signs of
    impairment of the appellant at the nightclub, the collision scene, or the
    hospitals to which he was taken or transferred after the collision.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Consequences of the Collision</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Neither the appellant nor either of his
    passengers could recall the circumstances of the collision. None gave evidence
    at trial. The appellant and his front seat passenger were severely injured in
    the collision. Each suffered internal and brain injuries.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Grounds of Appeal against Conviction</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On his appeal from conviction, the appellant
    says the trial judge erred:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>in drawing conclusions contrary to the ASF based
    on misapprehensions of or lack of support in the evidence adduced at trial;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>in inferring guilt from the consequences of the
    collision; and</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>in finding each offence proven through circular reasoning.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #1: Erroneous Findings of Fact</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Reasons of the Trial Judge</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge began his consideration of the
    offences alleged in the indictment with the counts charging impaired operation.
    The issue, he said, was whether the Crown had proven the alleged impairment
    beyond a reasonable doubt on the basis of the evidence of the appellant’s projected
    blood alcohol concentration, the manner of driving and the expert evidence of
    the forensic toxicologist. He acknowledged that there was no direct evidence of
    the manner of the appellant’s driving and that the evidence was that the
    appellant had displayed no signs of physical impairment at the nightclub, at
    the accident scene and at the hospital.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In examining the evidence about the speed of the
    appellant’s vehicle at the time of the accident, the trial judge affirmed the
    absence of any direct evidence of the precise speed before or at any point
    during the accident. However, the trial judge recognized that, like any fact in
    issue, the relative speed of the vehicle could be established by circumstantial
    evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The cumulative effect of several items of
    evidence persuaded the trial judge that when he lost control of his vehicle,
    the appellant was travelling at a speed that was far beyond what was safe under
    the conditions and constituted a marked departure from the standard of a
    reasonably prudent driver. Among the items of evidence were these:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the absence of any mechanical defect as a
    contributing factor;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the straight, level, unobstructed nature of the
    highway and road surface;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>the posted speed limit of 60 km/h;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>iv.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>the absence of any difficulty for first responders and other
    motorists to navigate the wet surface of the roadway safely;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>v.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the absence of evidence of skid marks suggesting
    the intervention of some external factor requiring evasive action;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>vi.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>the relationship between a speed that exceeds the available friction
    between the tire and road surface and loss of control of the vehicle; and</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>vii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>the circumstances of the several collisions with light standards and
    parked vehicles including the extent of damage caused.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In determining whether the evidence established
    that the appellant’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by his
    consumption of alcohol, the trial judge reviewed the testimony of the forensic
    toxicologist. He concluded that the circumstantial evidence relating to the
    appellant’s driving showed the indicia of mental impairment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge accepted that driving was a
    complex task involving divided attention, choices, reaction time, and judgment
    of speed and distance. All these mental processes are impaired when a driver’s
    blood alcohol concentration is 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of
    blood and impairment increases as the blood alcohol concentration increases.
    The appellant’s blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident
    exceeded 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The trial judge
    recognized the possibility of an outlier at a blood alcohol concentration of 50
    milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, but noted that this
    prospect diminished as the blood alcohol concentration increased.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The absence of common indicia of physical
    impairment, such as loss of balance and slurred speech, were important. What
    was critical, however, was not physical impairment, but rather mental
    impairment, that is to say, impairment of the ability to perform the complex
    task of driving a motor vehicle. The trial judge concluded that the appellant drove
    while impaired:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The circumstantial evidence as to the
    accused's driving shows the indicia of mental impairment as described by the
    toxicologist. Mr. Stennett was able to travel across Highway 7 to Kipling
    without incident, but he failed to perceive the need to slow his speed and he
    failed to react to the wet road condition. The evidence shows Mr. Stennett is
    not the rare, theoretical outlier as discussed in cross-examination. On the
    contrary, his driving errors show the effects of alcohol impairment on the mental
    faculties necessary to drive safely that were identified by the toxicologist.
    The Crown is not required to prove intoxication or marked impairment.
    Considering all of the evidence and the legal test, I find the lack of physical
    indicia and other circumstances do not reasonably leave a doubt. The Crown has
    proved impairment by alcohol in the mental faculties necessary for safe
    driving.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the count charging dangerous operation
    causing bodily harm, the trial judge expressed his conclusion in this way:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The whole of the evidence including the
    circumstances of the multiple collisions shows that the accused drove far in
    excess of the speed that was safe for the road conditions that evening. He was
    driving while his ability to judge safe speed and react to road conditions was
    impaired by alcohol consumption which is a departure from the standard of care
    required for safe driving. The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that
    the accused's manner of driving was dangerous to the public and a marked departure
    from the standard of care a reasonable person would observe.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Arguments on Appeal</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant contends that the finding of fact
    upon which the convictions are grounded is that the appellant was driving at a
    grossly excessive speed at the time of the accident. This finding, the
    appellant says, was fatally flawed for three reasons. It was based on a
    misapprehension of the evidence. It was contrary to the ASF. And it was
    unsupported by the evidence adduced at trial. It follows that neither conviction
    can stand.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The misapprehension of the evidence, the
    appellant submits, has to do with the collision reconstructionist’s reference
    to the effect of the speed of the vehicle exceeding the available friction
    between the tire and road surface on the loss of control. The report said that <em>if</em> the speed of the vehicle exceeded the available friction between the tire and
    the roadway, a loss of control over the operation of the vehicle may occur. But
    the collision reconstructionist did not say that a speed exceeding the
    available friction was the cause of the accident as the trial judge concluded.
    The expert pointed to several other factors that might cause a driver to lose
    control of their vehicle and said that he could not determine which factor was
    at work here.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, the appellant says, the finding of
    excessive speed was contrary to the ASF. There it was clear that the pre-impact
    speed of the vehicle could not be determined. It was and remained an unknown.
    The report of the collision reconstructionist, which was part of the ASF,
    offered no reason for the loss of control of the vehicle and did not say that
    excessive speed caused or contributed to the loss of control.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the end, the appellant concludes, the
    evidence adduced at trial simply cannot support the trial judge’s conclusion
    that excessive speed caused the accident. There were other explanations for the
    loss of control. But the trial judge never considered them, nor their impact
    upon proof of the essential elements of the offences charged. As a whole, the
    evidence falls short of the standard of persuasion required. Acquittals should
    be entered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent rejects any suggestion of error
    in the trial judge’s conclusion or in the analysis that underpins it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The ASF and the language used in the report of
    the collision reconstructionist were not so definitive or conclusive that they
    foreclosed an examination of the evidence, the available inferences and making
    findings of fact concerning the cause of the loss of control. Nothing suggested
    that speed was not a factor or that the cause of the loss of control could not
    be determined. The absence of direct evidence did not preclude the use of
    circumstantial evidence or conclusions based on inferences from that evidence
    taken as a whole.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge properly concluded that the
    phrase “travelling at a speed that exceeds available friction” meant simply
    driving too quickly for the road conditions, given the wetness and the
    available friction, irrespective of the actual speed at which the vehicle
    travelled. This conclusion was not at odds with the ASF.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the respondent continues, it was
    uncontroversial that the appellant lost control of the car and that this caused
    the accident. It fell to the trial judge to determine, if he could, why the
    appellant lost control. The trial judge recognized that this was his task and
    that he had to consider other plausible theories or reasonable possibilities.
    He did so and concluded that excessive speed was the cause. He was not required
    to consider speculative possibilities.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent says that the trial judge’s
    finding that the appellant drove far in excess of the speed that was safe for
    the road conditions was grounded in the evidence adduced at trial. Although it
    was not possible to know or find a precise or exact pre-impact speed of the
    vehicle, the nature of the accident itself could provide circumstantial
    evidence about the speed of the vehicle relative to the road conditions at the
    time of the accident. This could inform the decision on whether the appellant’s
    driving amounted to dangerous operation of a motor vehicle.</span></p>

    fails on this ground as well, the court must inquire whether the

    forms part of the ASF.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my respectful view, this argument is based on
    a mischaracterization of the ASF and, in particular, the Collision
    Reconstruction Report.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Collision Reconstruction Report is not a
    formal admission of fact within s. 655 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. It
    follows that it is not conclusive of the facts stated but rather subject to
    contradiction or qualification. It is an informal or evidentiary admission, in
    essence, a “will say” or “can say” statement of what the author of the report
    could or would say if called to testify about its subject-matter. It dispenses
    with the swearing or affirmation of the witness and the taking of evidence by
    admitting what their evidence would be if it were called. Labelling the
    document that refers to the report as “Agreed Statement of Facts” does not
    alter the fundamental character of the report.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As with any item of evidence received at trial,
    the trial judge, as the trier of fact, could accept or reject the contents of
    the report in whole or in part. He was entitled to draw reasonable inferences
    from it. His conclusion that the appellant drove at a grossly excessive speed
    in the circumstances was not foreclosed, as the appellant contends, by the ASF
    or the contents of the Collision Reconstruction Report.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, to the extent that the Collision
    Reconstruction Report represents the opinion of its author, it is debatable
    whether it could be the subject of a formal admission under s. 655 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. The section only permits an accused or counsel to admit “any fact
    alleged against him”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, misapprehension of evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant urges that the trial judge
    misapprehended the collision reconstructionist’s opinion in concluding that the
    appellant’s speed was so excessive that it amounted to the criminal offence of
    dangerous operation. However, when read as a whole, the reasons of the trial
    judge do not support the interpretation the appellant advances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, it was undisputed that the appellant
    lost control of the vehicle he was driving. The trial judge recognized that he
    needed to determine, if he could on the available evidence, why this loss of
    control occurred. This involved consideration of various possible explanations
    and whether it amounted to either offence charged. One such explanation was
    that the appellant was driving too fast for the conditions of the road at the
    time. The trial judge examined other possible explanations for the loss of
    control, such as a curve in the road, sudden braking and a need for steering
    correction, and rejected them, as he was entitled to do. Of some assistance on
    the issue of degree of departure from the speed safe for the road conditions
    were the circumstances of the collisions involved. The conclusion that the
    manner in which the appellant was driving amounted to dangerous operation was one
    reached on the basis of the evidence as a whole, not on a misapprehension of
    any particular item of evidence including the opinion of the collision
    reconstructionist.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the appellant lost control of the vehicle was because of the grossly excessive
    speed at which he was driving, the trial judge was required to consider whether
    all other plausible theories or reasonable possibilities inconsistent with
    culpability could account for the accident. These non-culpable inferences could
    arise from the evidence or the absence of evidence. However, to be availing,
    those inferences must be reasonable, given the evidence and the absence of
    evidence, assessed logically and in light of human experience and common sense.
    Circumstantial evidence does not have to exclude merely conceivable or possible
    inferences, only those that are reasonable and not speculative.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It remains fundamentally for the trier of fact
    to determine whether any proposed alternative way of looking at the case is
    reasonable enough to raise a doubt. In other words, it is fundamentally for the
    trier of fact to draw the line in each case that separates reasonable doubt
    from speculation. The trier of fact’s assessment can be set aside only where it
    is unreasonable. Here, it was reasonable for the trial judge to conclude that
    the evidence as a whole excluded all reasonable alternatives to guilt.</span></p>

    of the accident.</span></p>

  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Arguments on Appeal</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the <em>actus reus</em> or conduct requirement in the offence of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle
    focuses on the manner in which the vehicle is operated, and the risks
    associated with it. The focus is not on the consequences of the manner of
    operation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fault element in dangerous operation, the
    appellant says, required the Crown to prove that the manner of driving was a
    marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonable person in equivalent
    circumstances. This is a modified objective standard, more than mere
    carelessness or momentary inattention. And it cannot be established by simply
    drawing an inference from proof of the conduct requirement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the appellant continues, the trial
    judge conflated the consequences of the accident with the manner in which the
    vehicle was operated and the extent it departed from the standard of a
    reasonable person. In essence, the trial judge inferred both the conduct and
    fault elements from the mere fact of the accident and its consequences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge
    undertook no meaningful inquiry into either essential element of dangerous
    operation. He did not examine the manner of driving but rather simply found
    grossly excessive speed, a conclusion at odds with the ASF and unsupported by
    the evidence. Likewise for the fault element. No meaningful inquiry. And a
    conclusion of marked departure from nothing more than the consequences of the
    accident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent rebuffs the appellant’s claim
    that the trial judge’s finding of guilt of dangerous operation rested on an
    impermissible inference from the consequences of the accident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A review of the reasons for judgment betrays any
    claim that the findings on the conduct and fault elements of the offence were
    no more than inferences from the bodily harm caused and property damaged by the
    accident. Admittedly, the reasons could have been more expansive. But his
    reasons show that he was aware of the tests for both elements and why he was
    satisfied that they had been met.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Read as a whole, together with the colloquies
    with counsel during submissions, what emerges clearly is that the trial judge
    was keenly aware of the essential elements of the offence and why the evidence
    satisfied him that those elements had been established with the required degree
    of certainty. The trial judge relied upon his finding of grossly excessive
    speed which caused the appellant to lose control of the vehicle as the basis
    for his conclusion that the conduct requirement had been met. In connection
    with the fault element, the trial judge relied on his finding of impaired
    ability to appreciate the risk created by driving too fast in the conditions to
    conclude that this was a marked departure from the requisite standard of care.</span></p>

    provision makes clear, it is the <em>manner</em> in which the motor vehicle was
    operated that is at issue, not the consequences of the driving. The
    consequences, such as bodily harm, may make the offence more serious. But the
    consequences have no say on whether the offence of dangerous operation has been
    established: <em>R. v. Beatty</em>, 2008 SCC 5, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, at para.

    the answer to the first question is “yes”, the second question is whether the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Like the respondent, I would characterize the
    trial judge’s reasons on the count charging dangerous operation causing bodily
    harm as spare. However, the appellant does not suggest that they are
    insufficient to permit meaningful appellate review. Nor am I persuaded otherwise
    when they are considered as a whole, together with the evidence adduced, the
    positions advanced and the exchanges between counsel and the trial judge during
    final submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found the conduct element or <em>actus
    reus</em> established on the basis of the persuasive force of several
    circumstances. Speed that was far in excess of the speed that was safe in view
    of the existing road conditions. A blood alcohol concentration consistent with
    impairment of the ability to carry out the complex tasks associated with the
    operation of a motor vehicle, including timely and appropriate responses to the
    unpredictable. The circumstances of the accident as indicative of the relative
    speed of the vehicle. The conclusion is barren of any reference to the
    consequences of the accident to the appellant or his passengers. This
    combination of factors and circumstances provided an adequate evidentiary
    predicate to ground a finding that the conduct element or <em>actus reus</em><em><span

    been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

    contaminated by any improper consideration of the consequences of the accident
    to the appellant and his passengers. As we have seen from </span></em><em>Chung</em><em><span

    fault element where, in all the circumstances, it supports the inference that
    the driving resulted from a marked departure from the standard of care that a
    reasonable person would have exhibited in the same circumstances. In this case,
    that inference from excessive speed and the conduct element was further
    supported by evidence of impairment of the ability to operate a motor vehicle

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The final ground of appeal converts elements of its two predecessors
    into a complaint that the convictions rested on circular reasoning. The
    appellant drove dangerously because his ability to drive was impaired by
    alcohol, and because he drove dangerously, his ability to operate a motor
    vehicle was impaired by alcohol. In other words, dangerous operation proved
    impairment and impairment, dangerous operation.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Arguments on Appeal</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant says that the evidence of the forensic toxicologist
    was generic, based on statistical models. She acknowledged that she could not
    provide an opinion about impairment of any individual’s ability to operate a
    motor vehicle after consuming alcohol without testing that person. She did not
    perform any tests on the appellant, who showed no physical signs of impairment.
    Not everybody with a blood alcohol concentration of 50 milligrams of alcohol in
    100 millilitres of blood will be impaired. Yet the trial judge found, based on
    this generic evidence, that the appellant’s ability to operate his motor
    vehicle was impaired by his consumption of alcohol.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>According to the appellant, he could not be found guilty of impaired
    operation solely on the basis of his own blood alcohol concentration and the
    expert’s generic opinion about impairment at blood alcohol concentrations of 50
    milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and beyond. Case-specific
    information was required. The trial judge found the appellant guilty of
    impaired operation based on his conclusion that the appellant had driven
    dangerously. That he drove dangerously proved his ability to operate a motor
    vehicle was impaired by alcohol. But, the appellant continues, the trial judge
    also reasoned that the appellant drove dangerously because he drove while
    impaired when he found as follows: “He was driving while his ability to judge
    safe speed and react to road conditions was impaired by alcohol consumption
    which is a departure from the standard of care”. This reasoning is circular. In
    the result, neither conviction can stand.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The respondent takes the position that the trial judge did not
    engage in circular reasoning in reaching his conclusion that the essential
    elements of each offence were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In the respondent’s submission, the trial judge recognized that
    impairment was not only an essential element of one offence, but also relevant
    to proof of an essential element of the other. The judge was aware that there
    was a conflict between the observations of those who saw the appellant before,
    at the scene, and after the accident and the testimony of the forensic
    toxicologist. No one saw any physical signs of impairment or intoxication. Yet
    the toxicologist testified that impairment of the ability to operate a motor
    vehicle begins at a blood alcohol concentration of 50 milligrams of alcohol in
    100 millilitres of blood.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The respondent says that the trial judge dealt with these apparent
    inconsistencies. There were differences between the physical indicia of
    impairment and impairment of the mental faculties required to drive safely.
    Impaired operation only requires proof of the latter. The judge also referred
    to the toxicologist’s evidence that although a person with the appellant’s
    blood alcohol concentration might be able to successfully drive between two
    points on a familiar roadway without becoming involved in a collision, their
    ability to operate their motor vehicle would be impaired nonetheless. This
    impairment would affect their ability to recognize and respond correctly to any
    unusual circumstance they encountered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In this case, the trial judge drew reasonable inferences from the
    evidence. His finding on the conduct element of the dangerous operation count
    was not based on any finding of impairment, but rather on a finding that the
    appellant lost control of his vehicle because he was driving at a speed well in
    excess of what the circumstances permitted. The reference to the appellant’s
    impairment was only considered in relation to the fault element where it was
    relevant to the question of whether the appellant’s conduct amounted to a
    marked departure from the standard of care a reasonably prudent driver would
    exercise in equivalent circumstances.</span></p>

    element of the impaired operation offence. That same evidence was also relevant
    in proof of the objective fault element on the count of dangerous operation.
    The mere fact the same evidence is relevant and admissible in proof of both
    elements exemplifies multiple relevance or admissibility, not circular
