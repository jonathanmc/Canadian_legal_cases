  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Zarnett J.A.:</span></strong></p>

  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent, Anna Przyk, slipped and fell on
    a sidewalk located between the entrance and exit of the retirement home where
    she resided. She sued the owner of the retirement home — the appellant (“Rushdale”)
    — for negligence and breach of the <em>Occupiers’ Liability Act</em>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. O.2. The quantum of damages was agreed to and a trial proceeded before
    a judge and jury on liability alone. The jury found no liability on the part of
    Rushdale, and the action was dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Rushdale, as the successful party to the action,
    asked for an award of partial indemnity costs against Ms. Przyk. The trial
    judge denied the request for three reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, he observed that the action, which
    required expert evidence, illustrated the need that the law of negligence adapt
    to the growing area of elder care.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, he held that since Rushdale was insured
    and had been defended by an insurer — Aviva — which holds a large share of the
    Ontario insurance market, the case was a “David and Goliath situation”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, he was critical of the fact that Aviva
    had never offered a settlement to Ms. Przyk, other than a no costs dismissal of
    her claim. The trial judge considered this to be an example of Aviva’s
    arrogant, “hardball” approach on display generally when it defends claims — an
    approach that is unfair to litigants of modest means and inconsistent with
    Aviva’s “social responsibility”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Rushdale obtained leave from a panel of this
    court to appeal the costs ruling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the trial judge’s costs ruling
    reflects certain errors in principle. The fact that Rushdale was insured and
    defended by Aviva, a large insurer, was not a reason to deny an award of costs.
    Neither the existence of insurance in favour of a successful party at trial,
    nor the fact that the successful party was better resourced than their
    opponent, is a justification for denying costs where the resource advantage has
    not been used to engage in abusive tactics or other misconduct during the
    litigation. The refusal of a party to offer a financial settlement before trial
    is also not a reason to deny that party costs where the refusal is proven
    reasonable by the verdict. Nor ought the trial judge to have sought to correct
    a general attitude of Aviva toward settlement in other cases by his costs award
    in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nevertheless, I would not interfere with the
    costs award. The trial judge viewed Ms. Przyk’s case as addressing an
    underdeveloped area of the law and thus to have raised important and novel
    issues, which is a proper consideration in deciding whether costs should be
    awarded. This finding was not tainted by any errors in the costs decision and
    is entitled to deference from this court. It is sufficient on its own to
    justify the result reached by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Standard of Review</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An appellate court takes a deferential approach when
    reviewing a discretionary award of costs by a trial court (including a
    discretionary decision to deny costs). A costs award will only be set aside on
    appeal “if the trial judge has made an error in principle or if the costs award
    is plainly wrong”: <em>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd.</em>, 2004 SCC 9,
    [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303, at para. 27.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This deferential approach requires that attention
    be paid not only to the nature of any error affecting a costs decision, but
    also to its extent. It is insufficient  to identify an error in principle in
    the course of the trial judge’s reasons without considering whether there is an
    independent basis to uphold the order. An appellate court should be reluctant
    to interfere with “the exercise of discretion by a trial judge who had a much
    better opportunity to acquaint himself with, and have a feeling for, all of the
    factors that formed the basis for the award of costs”: <em>Bell Canada v.
    Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.</em>, 1994 ONCA 239, 111 D.L.R. (4th) 589
    at para. 41. Even where a trial judge has relied on a factor that is
    unsupported by proper legal principles or considerations to deny costs to a
    successful party, an appellate court should not intervene unless it can “find
    nothing in the factual circumstances or argument to support the order”: <em>Bell
    Canada </em>at para. 42.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A successful party to civil litigation in
    Ontario is entitled to a reasonable expectation that it will receive an order
    for payment of its costs unless there are special circumstances<a href="#_ftn1"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:

    23<em>; Lundy's Regency Arms Corp. v. Potato Factory Bar &amp; Grill Corp</em>,
    2020 ONSC 238 (Div. Ct.) at para. 11.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although sometimes referred to as the “loser
    pays” costs rule, this approach is not, properly understood, a rule at all.
    Costs are in the discretion of the court, which may determine by and to whom
    costs are payable and in what amount: <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. C.43, s. 131(1). A court in the exercise of that discretion may
    consider, among other things, the result of the proceeding: <em>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 57.01(1). But the result is not the
    exclusive consideration, and thus a successful party does not have an
    entitlement to costs, but merely a reasonable expectation that they will be
    awarded, absent special circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A judge may deprive a successful party of costs,
    or even order the successful party to pay costs, as long as the exercise of
    discretion to do so is not tainted by errors of law or principle, or does not
    result in a decision that is plainly wrong because it is based on irrelevant
    factors and overlooks relevant ones: rr. 57.01(4), 57.01(2); <em>Bell Canada, </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>at paras. 20, 41-42; </span></em><em>Birtzu v. McCron</em>,
    2019 ONCA 777, 438 D.L.R. (4th) 141 at paras. 10-17, 20-21.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge cited what he termed the “normative
    or default approach” that costs should follow the event. He recognized that his
    discretion to make a different order had to be exercised “fairly and reasonably”.
    He quoted the factors set out in r. 57.01, which may be considered in the
    exercise of discretion over costs, although he did not identify, as applicable,
    any specific factor listed in that rule other than the importance of the issues.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> He then went on to identify
    three reasons why Rushdale, although successful in the action, should not
    receive an award of costs. For analytical purposes, I address them in a
    different order than the trial judge.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A David and Goliath Situation</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge said that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Modest complainants are always at the mercy of
    the economics of litigation. This is not a lucrative area for a personal
    litigator. It is not unexpected that a plaintiff such as Anna Przyk could end
    up against an insurer such as Aviva, an insurer of retirement homes with a head
    office in Kentucky. This could be characterized as a “David and Goliath&quot;
    situation. Access to justice could be threatened by the resources of the
    opposing side.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge cited no authority for the
    proposition that the existence of insurance could be relied on in the way that
    he did.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[3]</span></span></span></a> In my view, the trial judge erred in principle in his reliance on the fact that
    Rushdale was insured by Aviva, and the implications he derived from that fact.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no doubt that a party who is being
    defended by an insurer has resources to conduct the defence. But what is
    relevant to the question of costs is not the existence of defence-facilitating
    resources, but how the resources were used in the litigation. I draw this
    conclusion for three reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> First, although the factors listed in r. 57.01 are
    non-exhaustive, they all relate to the nature of the issues in the litigation,
    the result, and to the way a party behaved in the litigation. None point to the
    identity or resources of the party. Nor do the provisions of r. 49.10, which
    set out cost consequences for failure to accept an offer to settle, support the
    view that the resources of the party making or refusing the offer is relevant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, it would be wrong to punish a successful
    party, or their insurer, by using the existence of insurance as a reason to
    deny an award of costs on the theory that insurance, by resourcing the defence, <u>could</u> threaten access to justice, without considering whether there <u>was</u> improper litigation conduct by the successful party that in fact did interfere
    with access to justice for the unsuccessful claimant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, it is wrong to leap to the conclusion
    that a plaintiff with a modest claim against an insured defendant is
    necessarily in a David and Goliath situation without examining the
    circumstances. Proceedings should not be stereotyped: <em>Kerr v. Danier
    Leather Inc.</em>, 2007 SCC 44, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 331 at para. 69. An apparently
    tilted playing field might be levelled in a number of ways, such as through contingency
    fee arrangements, third party litigation funding, or adverse costs insurance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Ms. Pryzk was not denied access to justice. She
    took her case to trial, and although the arrangements through which this
    occurred were not explored, there is no doubt that Ms. Przyk was represented by
    experienced counsel at trial. The trial judge noted that “(t)he case for the
    plaintiff was well-presented”. Both sides called experts. Nothing in the trial
    judge’s reasons supports the view that Ms. Przyk’s case was prejudiced by a
    mis-match of resources.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the trial judge overlooked the fact
    that Ms. Przyk had obtained adverse costs insurance, and that Rushdale’s
    request was for costs only to the extent covered by the insurance available to
    Ms. Pryzk under that policy. Rushdale did not seek any amount from Ms. Przyk
    personally.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge made no finding of conduct in
    the litigation that would justify depriving Rushdale of costs. He did not, for
    example, cite any conduct that unnecessarily lengthened the proceedings, any
    improper, vexatious or unnecessary steps taken on its behalf, or any refusal to
    admit something that it should have. On the contrary, he noted that “(b)oth
    sides treated this particular case seriously”, and that the parties had agreed
    before trial to the quantum of damages, allowing the trial to be confined to
    the issue of liability. In other words, neither any resource advantage due to
    the fact that Rushdale was insured by Aviva, nor Aviva’s conduct of the defence,
    resulted in anything other than responsibly conducted litigation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the trial judge erred in principle

lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the trial judge did not advert to any
    litigation misconduct, he was critical of Aviva’s settlement conduct. He
    referred to the fact that counsel for Ms. Przyk “was throughout the course of
    the litigation open to resolve the matter”, but that the “adjusters and counsel
    for [Rushdale], members of the in-house legal department of Aviva, resolutely
    put forth a negative proposal of no damages nor costs”. He referred to the
    position advanced by Ms. Przyk that the refusal of the defence to offer
    anything other than a no costs “walk away” constituted playing “hardball”, that
    this is a “well-known tactic by Aviva”, and that Aviva advertises for employees
    who will work with counsel to ensure a consistent message “with judges,
    mediators, and counsel surrounding our litigation files”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>From reading the employment advertising for
    Aviva concerning the sending a message to judges, mediators, and counsel, one
    detects a certain arrogance. Size of the insurance market is not inconsequential.
    Insurers are answerable to their shareholders. Playing hardball with the modest
    litigant may indeed be profitable, but that does not mean that the modest
    litigant should have a field day or that the insurer be vulnerable to frivolous
    claims. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Being a large market shareholder is not
    without social responsibility, size should not be wielded to oppress deserving
    litigants as that would encroach upon the broader social interest of access to
    justice. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Aviva with its approach is at risk of allegations
    of playing hardball. In some circumstances that approach may result in no
    costs. In a way, that is a cost of doing business in such a fashion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Although the trial judge referred to an insurer
    using its size to “oppress deserving litigants”, he did not refer to any
    conduct of Aviva <u>in this case</u> which could be so characterized, other
    than its failure to offer a financial settlement to Ms. Pryzk. In <em>Bell</em> <em>Canada</em>, this court held that it is an error in principle to rely on
    the failure of a successful defendant to have offered a payment to an
    unsuccessful plaintiff as a ground to deny costs. Carthy J.A. stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>I do not back away from my comment in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Armak Chemicals Ltd. v. Canadian National Railway Co.</span></em><span
lang=EN>:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>At the same time, every litigant should be
    encouraged to be single-minded in attention to the need to make and consider
    reasonable offers which may dispose of the litiga</span><span lang=EN-CA>tion</span><span
lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The question is, what is reasonable when the
    claim is dismissed? The defendant's position has been vindicated, and to
    deprive that party of the normal fruits of success is to say to all defendants
    that an offer to settle must be made simply because the lawsuit was launched.
    To put it another way, the trial judge cannot dispute the reasonableness of his
    own decision and, thus, cannot be critical of a party who anticipated it.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The courts must also be careful not to become too
    paternalistic with litigants or to unnecessarily discourage recourse to the
    trial as a forum for the resolution of disputes. Concern is properly directed
    to unreasonable conduct in the course of litigation which leads to unnecessary
    or prolonged trials. However, the judicial system is here to serve the public
    and no barriers to access should be imposed by warnings as to cost consequences
    arising from the court's assessment of how litigants should conduct their
    business.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>There are many reasons not to offer settlement,
    and they should remain the private preserve of the litigants. In a libel suit,
    for example, vindication may be a legitimate consideration for either party,
    standing above recovery or payment of money…A defendant may not be in a
    position to pay a settlement and, even if wealthy, may have a better business
    use for the money pending trial. None of these litigants should fall from grace
    in the eyes of the trial judge if they succeed on the merits: at paras. 13-16.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s reasoning is contrary to that
    in <em>Bell Canada</em>. Aviva’s decision not to offer Ms. Przyk a payment was
    confirmed as reasonable by the result of the trial. The analysis does not
    change by characterizing Aviva’s settlement posture in this case as a hardball
    approach. As the court in <em>Bell Canada</em> pointed out, a litigant, or its
    insurer, even if wealthy, is not obliged to pay a settlement just because it
    has been sued; it is entitled to have the claim determined by the court.
    Although the absence of a reasonable settlement posture may influence the
    disposition of costs, when the result of the trial is known what is reasonable
    is necessarily judged by that result. This is consistent with the philosophy
    underlying r. 49.10, which expressly requires comparing an unaccepted offer to
    the result at trial in order to determine whether the cost consequences
    stipulated by that rule apply.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Przyk cites various cases where an insurer’s
    failure to make a satisfactory settlement offer was the subject of comment by a
    trial court or a pre-trial judge.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[4]</span></span></span></a> But those were cases where the plaintiff was successful at trial, and thus entitled
    to a reasonable expectation of costs, or where a step in the proceeding was a
    waste of time due to unreasonable defence conduct. They were not cases where a
    successful defendant was punished by denying it costs simply because its
    pre-trial settlement position did not go beyond what was reasonable as judged
    against the result achieved at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for Ms. Przyk also points to a motor
    vehicle case where Aviva, as the insurer, failed to offer a settlement of more
    than zero dollars. No costs were awarded even though the plaintiff’s award at
    trial was effectively zero dollars: <em>Peterson v. Phillips</em>, 2008 CanLII
    19504 (Ont. S.C.) at para. 26.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Peterson</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> is
    readily distinguishable. In that case, liability was admitted, and the jury
    found that the plaintiff had suffered damages. However, it assessed the damages
    at an amount that netted out to zero after subtracting the deductible under the
    relevant provisions of the <em>Insurance Act</em> and its regulations. Since
    under the <em>Insurance Act</em>, the plaintiff’s entitlement to costs was to
    be determined before giving effect to the deductible provisions, the plaintiff
    argued that it was entitled to costs. However, the court declined to give the
    plaintiff any costs, as the plaintiff had refused an offer of zero dollars – ultimately
    the judgment in the action. The defendant was neither criticized for making
    that offer, nor deprived of costs for having done so. Rather, the defendant
    benefitted in avoiding a costs award against it by virtue of having made the
    offer: paras. 24-26.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also erred in accepting the
    submission of Ms. Pryzk that Aviva generally plays hardball, a reference to its
    behaviour in other cases.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[5]</span></span></span></a> In my view, the trial judge was not in a position to assess whether the
    circumstances in other cases were the same as those applicable here, or even whether
    settlement positions taken in other cases were reasonable. Moreover, even if
    Aviva had not been reasonable in other cases, it is not clear why the remedy
    would be to deny its insured costs in this case where it was found to have
    acted reasonably.</span></p>

    this approach as a basis for his decision. He noted not only that the case
    involved expert evidence but that it arose in an important and developing
    societal and legal context. He said: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As mentioned above, demographically, eldercare

    the nature, importance, and complexity of issues in exercising its costs
    discretion. Novel issues arise where there is uncertainty in the law or where
    the facts make the guidance provided by prior cases inadequate: <em>Fischer v.
    IG Investment Management Ltd.</em>, 2014 ONSC 6260, at paras. 9, 35. A novel
    issue that involves the public interest can support a no costs order as an
    exception to the general approach that a successful party will receive their
    costs: <em>Childs v. Desormeaux</em> (2004), 239 D.L.R. (4th) 61 (Ont. C.A.) at
