    motion for an anti-suit injunction brought by the moving party plaintiffs, Prateek
    Gupta, UD Trading Group Holding PTE. Limited (“UDTG”), and several related
    companies, including three subsidiaries of UDTG (the “UIL Companies”). </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the same endorsement, the motion judge allowed
    a cross-motion by the responding party defendants, TransAsia Private Capital
    Limited and TA Private Capital Security Agent Ltd. (collectively referred to as
    “TAP”) to permanently stay the underlying action initiated by the moving
    parties in Ontario (the “Underlying Action”) on the basis of <em>forum non

    this aspect of the motion judge’s order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By endorsement dated April 20, 2021, I dismissed

    head office is located. Along with its subsidiaries, some of which are set out
    below, UDTG carries on business primarily in Asia and the Middle East and has
    offices in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“UAE”). UDTG provides its customers

    respectively. The UIL Companies are in the business of metal trading.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Vadox Corp. is a subsidiary of UDTG’s holding
    company, PPrime Limited. Vadox Corp. is incorporated and headquartered in the
    British Virgin Islands. It has no active operations. Although it is a moving
    party, it is unnecessary to refer to Vadox Corp. to unfold the relevant
    narrative.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The relevant agreements and transactions</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Reduced to the simplest of terms, Rutmet owed
    money to TAP as the result of a May 24, 2019 loan agreement for US$60 million (the
    “Rutmet Loan Agreement”). In exchange for liquidity, the Rutmet Loan Agreement provided
    TAP with security in the form of Rutmet’s receivables, which TAP was authorized
    to collect or bill directly from Rutmet’s customers, along with fees and
    interest. As a condition of the Rutmet Loan Agreement, Rutmet obtained accounts
    receivable insurance from EDC, the benefits of which Rutmet assigned to TAP (the
    “EDC Policy”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Rutmet had accounts receivable from metal sales
    to the UIL Companies. UDTG provided Rutmet with an unlimited corporate
    guarantee for the indebtedness of the UIL Companies (the “UDTG Guarantee”). Mr.
    Gupta provided Rutmet with an additional US$30 million guarantee for those same
    debts (the “Gupta Guarantee”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By September 2019, Rutmet had defaulted on
    payments it owed to TAP under the Rutmet Loan Agreement. On November 22, 2019, Rutmet
    and TAP executed a forbearance agreement in which TAP agreed to refrain from
    exercising its rights as a creditor against Rutmet until December 13, 2019 (the
    “Forbearance Agreement”). In return, Rutmet granted TAP a power of attorney to
    make claims on its behalf to enforce the UDTG and Gupta Guarantees. Rutmet also
    executed a power of attorney authorizing TAP to make arrangements to secure the
    proceeds of insurance for unpaid receivables under the EDC Policy. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The forbearance period under the Forbearance
    Agreement ended on December 13, 2019, with Rutmet having failed to cure its
    defaults before the deadline. TAP then notified Rutmet of TAP’s intention to
    enforce its security.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The relevant legal proceedings</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On February 13, 2020, TAP commenced a
    receivership application in Ontario against Rutmet (the “Receivership
    Application”). That Application led to the compelled disclosure by Rutmet of
    information necessary to permit TAP to submit a claim for coverage under the
    EDC Policy. The Receivership Application was then abandoned.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>TAP then submitted a claim to EDC under the
    Policy, but coverage was denied. On July 22, 2020, TAP brought an application in
    Ontario against EDC for declarations relating to EDC’s refusal to provide
    coverage under the Policy (the “EDC Application”). The EDC Application remains
    outstanding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As assignee, TAP also took steps to enforce the UDTG
    Guarantee of the debt owed by the UIL Companies to Rutmet. On July 9, 2020, TAP
    instituted an action in Singapore to enforce the UDTG Guarantee (the “Singapore
    Action”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>UDTG secured an order extending the time
    required to file a statement of defence in the Singapore Action until August 18,
    2020. On that date, instead of filing a statement of defence, UDTG applied for
    a stay of the Singapore Action on the basis that Ontario is the most
    appropriate forum (the “Singapore Stay Application”). The Singapore Stay
    Application has been adjourned multiple times. At the time I heard this motion,
    the Singapore Stay Application was scheduled for April 23, 2021.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Gupta resides in Dubai. On August 18, 2020,
    to conform with UAE law, TAP (via Rutmet) served Mr. Gupta with a final demand for
    payment under the Gupta Guarantee. If Mr. Gupta failed to pay, that notice
    permitted TAP to commence an enforcement action in Dubai on August 26, 2020.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 19, 2020, the day after Mr. Gupta was
    notified that the Gupta Guarantee would be enforced, the moving parties notified
    TAP that they had commenced the Underlying Action in Ontario on August 12, 2020.
    The relief sought in the Underlying Action includes declarations that (a) there
    are no outstanding receivables from the UIL Companies, and (b) there are no
    amounts owing under either of the UDTG or Gupta Guarantees.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In support of their claims, the moving parties
    contend TAP already recouped the funds owed by the UIL Companies to Rutmet (and
    assigned to TAP under the Rutmet Loan Agreement). They maintain this was
    accomplished when receivables owed to UDTG from metal sales were assigned and
    then paid to Triton Metallics Pte. Ltd. (“Triton”), a company the moving
    parties claim is controlled by TAP.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The moving parties further allege that, despite
    having been paid in this way, TAP then improperly enforced “additional security”
    for the Rutmet Loan Agreement. This alleged additional security took the form
    of shares in Gympie Eldorado Mining Pty Limited (“GEM”) and Hangji Global
    Limited (the “GEM and Hangji Security”). The moving parties contend that,
    although the relevant agreements indicate that the GEM and Hangji Security relates
    to independent loans TAP made to two of the UIL Companies (the “UIL Loan
    Agreements”), in fact, the GEM and Hangji Security was provided to secure the
    Rutmet Loan Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The moving parties allege the GEM and Hangji
    Security was arranged under the UIL Loan Agreements to hide its true nature from
    EDC (<em>i.e</em><i>., </i>as additional security for the Rutmet Loan Agreement),
    so that EDC would not rely on the riskiness of the GEM and Hangji Security to increase
    the deductible component on Rutmet’s accounts receivable insurance. The moving
    parties claim that this structure effectively increased the value of the EDC Policy
    in favour of TAP by US$30 million.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The moving parties claim they agreed to this
    arrangement at TAP’s insistence, on whom they had become financially dependent.
    They claim TAP was unjustly enriched by realizing on the GEM and Hangji Security
    under the UIL Loan Agreements after already having been made whole through
    Triton for the Rutmet Loan Agreement. In the Underlying Action, the moving
    parties not only seek to prevent TAP from enforcing the UDTG and Gupta Guarantees,
    they also seek damages from TAP for its alleged unjust enrichment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 26, 2020, having provided the requisite

    Sopinka J. made clear in <em>Amchem Products Incorporated v. British Columbia
    (Workers’ Compensation Board)</em>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897, at p. 913, that there
    is a “fundamental difference” between a domestic court issuing an anti-suit injunction,
    which in effect determines matters for a foreign court, and a domestic court
    staying a proceeding before itself. The former raises issues of international
    comity, but the latter does not. The inquiries into the suitability of forum
    therefore differ.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Most notably, in determining whether to grant an
    anti-suit injunction, the inquiry is based on the foreign court’s perspective.
    The domestic judge considering whether to issue an anti-suit injunction is to
    ask whether, applying Ontario’s principles of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, the
    court where the action sought to be restrained was commenced could reasonably
    have concluded there was no alternative forum that was “clearly more
    appropriate”. If the answer is yes, the decision of the foreign court to assume
    jurisdiction should not be interfered with: <em>Amchem</em>, at pp. 931-32. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By contrast, in determining whether a domestic
    action should be stayed, the domestic court must determine for itself whether
    there is another forum that is “clearly more appropriate [than the domestic
    court] for disposing of the litigation and thus ensuring fairness to the
    parties and a more efficient process for resolving their dispute”. A stay is
    appropriate only if this is so: <em>Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda</em>, 2012
    SCC 17, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 572, at paras. 108-109.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These inquiries can result in an anti-suit
    injunction being denied without the parallel domestic action being stayed, unlike
    the outcome arrived at by the motion judge. This will occur, for example, if
    both the domestic and foreign forums are equally appropriate. In such
    circumstances, a foreign court could reasonably conclude there is no
    alternative forum that is “clearly more appropriate”, thereby warranting denial
    of an anti-suit injunction. But a domestic court would not necessarily stay the
    parallel domestic action since the domestic court would be equally appropriate;
    in other words, the foreign forum would not be “clearly more appropriate”.</span></p>

    however, that where a preliminary assessment of the merits of the appeal shows it
    to be strong, this is a proper consideration in deciding whether to grant the
    stay, given the repeated recognition in this court that the strength of one <em>RJR-MacDonald</em><i> </i>factor may compensate for the weakness of others.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on their submissions before me, I

    support of this stay motion. However, in my view, this is not a case where the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, a key feature of the moving parties’
    argument on appeal is the claim that the motion judge failed to undertake a
    proper <em>forum non conveniens</em><i> </i>analysis as set out in the “leading
    case” of <em>Van Breda</em>. However, the Underlying Action that is the subject
    of the appeal advances claims which are fundamentally contractual in nature. In <em>Van Breda</em>,<i> </i>Lebel J. repeatedly confined the principles he
    developed to the assumption of jurisdiction in tort actions: <em>Van Breda</em>,
    at paras. 68, 80 and 85.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Parsian Energy Rad Gas</em>, 2019 ONCA 372, 93 B.L.R. (5th) 169, at paras. 7-8,
    in resolving a <em>forum non conveniens</em><i> </i>issue in a contract case, this
    court applied the factors Laskin J.A. identified in a pre-<em>Van Breda</em> contractual
    decision called <em>Young v. Tyco International of Canada Ltd.</em>, 2008 ONCA
    709, 300 D.L.R. (4th) 384, at para. 26.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I am not suggesting that general guidance cannot
    be taken from the <i>Van Breda </i>principles in resolving <em>forum non
    conveniens</em><i> </i>issues in contract cases. That is commonly done: see
    e.g., <em>Patterson v. EM Technologies, Inc</em>, 2013 ONSC 5849, at para. 17; <em>Wilson
    c. Fernand Campeau &amp; Fils Inc.</em>, 2020 ONCA 384, at paras. 9-12; <em>Osman
    v. Markplan Inc.</em>, 2018 ABCA 215, [2018] A.W.L.D. 2510, at para. 8. The
    point is that the absence of an express reference by the motion judge to the <em>Van
    Breda</em><i> </i>decision may not have the stark significance the moving
    parties ascribe to it, and an appeal panel may ultimately be persuaded that in
    the course of her decision, in substance, the motion judge consulted the
    correct considerations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, forum selection clauses, namely those in
    the Guarantees assigned to TAP through the Forbearance Agreement, and in agreements
    relating to the GEM and Hangji Security, specifically authorized TAP to
    commence actions outside of Ontario. Relying on the decisions in <em>Douez v.
    Facebook, Inc.</em>, 2017 SCC 33, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 751 and <em>ECS Educational
    Consulting Services Canada Ltd. v. Al Nahyan</em><i> </i>(2000), 44 C.P.C.
    (4th) 111, the motion judge concluded that the moving parties should be held to
    those forum selection clauses. The forum selection clauses stand as a material
    impediment to the moving parties’ claim that the motion judge erred in permanently
    staying the Underlying Action. </span></p>

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(b)     Irreparable Harm</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The moving parties urge that the failure to
    grant a stay pending appeal will cause them irreparable harm by: (i) creating a
    litigation disadvantage; (ii) putting them at risk of insolvency; and (iii)
    prejudicing them in the Singapore and UAE Actions by leaving in place the
    factual findings made by the motion judge pending appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I will explain, I do not accept any of these
    arguments.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>(i)    A
    litigation disadvantage has not been established</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The moving parties submit a litigation
    disadvantage will occur if a stay pending appeal is not ordered while the
    Singapore and UAE Actions proceed. If decisions are rendered by the Asian
    courts, the moving parties point out that the Underlying Action will be
    rendered moot. They will thereby lose the opportunity to have the merits of the
    decision determined in Ontario and they will be forced to litigate in multiple
    jurisdictions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>One problem with this submission is that there
    is no legal order in place preventing the responding parties from moving
    forward with the Singapore Action or the UAE Action. That will not change,
    whether I grant the stay or not. However, based on their submissions, the
    parties appear to agree that if I order a stay pending appeal, it may delay the
    responding parties’ foreign enforcement efforts pending the Ontario appeal. I will
    therefore proceed on that basis. Even so, I do not accept that the loss of
    litigation advantage alleged by the moving parties constitutes irreparable
    harm.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> It is important to appreciate that the moving
    parties have no right to have the matters in dispute litigated only in Ontario.
    Their request for an anti-suit injunction failed; they have not appealed that
    decision. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor do the moving parties have any legal or
    normative claim of right to have the issues disposed of in Ontario before the
    Singapore or UAE Actions are resolved. The Singapore Action preceded the
    Underlying Action. The responding parties had already given notice that the UAE
    Action would be commenced before they were served with the moving parties’
    statement of claim in the Underlying Action. The moving parties can have no
    reasonable expectation that the Ontario proceedings should take precedence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, even if the moving parties’ appeal
    succeeds in showing the Underlying Action in Ontario should not have been permanently
    stayed, the risk remains that matters will be resolved by the Singapore Action and/or
    the UAE Action before any decision on the merits in Ontario. As the moving
    parties pointed out in argument, citing <em>Amchem</em>, at p. 914, where no
    one forum is clearly more appropriate than another and parallel litigation occurs,
    it is anticipated and acceptable that the first decision rendered will resolve
    the matter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor do I have any basis on which to conclude
    that the quality of equity or justice will be compromised if the matters in
    issue are determined in the Singapore or UAE Actions, rather than in Ontario.
    There is no evidence before me to suggest the moving parties will be unable to raise
    their position that TAP has already been paid as a defence in those Actions, or
    that the foreign proceedings will otherwise be unfair. It is therefore
    difficult to accept that irreparable harm arises from the risk that the Singapore
    Action and/or the UAE Action could proceed before this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I turn now to the moving parties’ objection to being
    required to litigate in multiple jurisdictions. In my view, there is weight to
    the responding parties’ position and the motion judge’s observation that the
    moving parties have themselves compounded the multiplicity of proceedings by
    initiating the Underlying Action in Ontario. The moving parties’ objection does
    not resonate with me given that they are asking this court in their appeal to
    re-add the Underlying Action to the ongoing litigation mix.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, I can find no irreparable harm
    arising from any litigation disadvantage if the stay pending appeal is refused.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>(ii)   The
    risk of insolvency is not supported by the evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the responding parties that the
    moving parties did not adequately explain how my refusal to stay the motion
    judge’s permanent stay of the Underlying Action pending appeal could threaten
    their solvency. There is no evidence to support a finding that the litigation
    costs could cripple them if the motion judge’s stay is not lifted pending appeal,
    if that indeed is their concern. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his affidavit filed in support of this motion,
    Mr. Gupta appears to suggest that the spectre of insolvency arises in part from
    the risk that his assets will be exposed to attachment orders in the UAE. That
    outcome depends on the responding parties successfully prosecuting the UAE Action
    on the merits. On the evidence before me, I cannot find irreparable harm based
    on the financial implications of presumptively fair legal determinations made
    in other jurisdictions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In any event, even if the moving parties had
    established a basis on which to conclude that they could be put at risk of
    insolvency if a stay pending appeal is not ordered, this consideration would
    cut both ways. The responding parties could rely on the moving parties’ risk of
    insolvency to argue that the balance of convenience favours denying the stay,
    since any knock-on delay in enforcement in Asia could compromise the responding
    parties’ ability to recover funds from parties in supposedly dire financial
    straits.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(iii)  The
    findings made by the motion judge will not cause irreparable harm</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, the moving parties rely on findings
    made by the motion judge which they say amount to summary judgment against them
    undermining their position regarding the alleged Triton payments and the GEM
    and Hangji Security. They say these findings will irreparably prejudice them in
    the Asian proceedings if a stay pending appeal is not granted. I am not
    persuaded that these or any other findings made by the motion judge would cause
    irreparable harm if her decision is not stayed pending appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, I do not read the motion judge as having made
    any findings against the moving parties’ contention that TAP was already paid
    for the debts it is attempting to enforce in Singapore and the UAE.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The impugned passages must be read in context. When
    she made those findings, the motion judge was addressing the moving parties’ submission
    that the litigation is presumptively linked to Ontario because TAP’s claim
    against UDTG arose from the Rutmet Loan Agreement, making Rutmet the material
    debtor. In my view, the motion judge was doing no more than rejecting this argument
    by noting that the outstanding material issue in the litigation is “whether
    certain debts have been paid and the collateral validly enforced” under the UIL
    Loan Agreements. Her point was that the UIL Loan Agreements cannot be conflated
    with the Rutmet Loan Agreement for the purpose of identifying the appropriate
    forum for the litigation. As the motion judge noted earlier in summarizing the
    arguments of the parties, neither the UIL Loan Agreements, nor the alleged
    transactions with Triton that led to TAP’s alleged repayment under the Rutmet
    Loan Agreement, are linked to Ontario. Hence her finding that the moving
    parties failed to demonstrate a presumptive connecting factor to Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, even if the motion judge’s factual
    findings do somehow lend support to arguments the responding parties will
    advance in the Singapore Action and/or the UAE Action, the moving parties cannot
    be heard to complain. They initiated the Anti-Suit Motion and, in doing so, advanced
    factual claims to support their position. The findings the motion judge made were
    in large measure responsive to those claims. A party’s decision to voluntarily
    assume litigation risk does not qualify as irreparable harm: <em>M &amp; M
    Homes Inc. v. 2088556 Ontario Inc.</em>, 2020 ONCA 134, 51 C.P.C. (8th) 253, at
    paras. 39-40. Put simply the moving parties created the risk of the outcome
    they now seek to identify as irremediable harm.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the moving
    parties would suffer irreparable harm if a stay pending appeal is denied.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(c)     The Balance
    of Convenience</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I have already addressed the potential harm the
    moving parties rely upon. I have found none that would be irreparable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I accept the moving parties’ representations
    that they took steps to ameliorate potential harm to the responding parties
    flowing from a stay, such as agreeing to post security for costs and moving to
    expedite the appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, these initiatives do not account for
    the most material inconvenience a stay would visit on the responding parties. Both
    the Singapore Action and the UAE Action have already been delayed for many
    months. As noted, granting the stay would likely cause further delay. Delay
    works against the responding parties’ financial interests. As I have indicated,
    there is no basis before me on which to apprehend that the respective foreign courts
    will proceed unfairly in adjudicating the Singapore and UAE Actions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the balance of convenience favours
    the responding parties.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(d)     Other Considerations</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The moving parties also argued before me that
    the responding parties attorned to the jurisdiction of Ontario by initiating
    the Receivership Application and the EDC Application in Ontario, and by serving
    a notice of motion for security for costs of this appeal. I am not persuaded
    that attornment considerations play any role in this motion for a stay pending
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The moving parties did not have standing in the
    Receivership Application or the EDC Application, and both proceedings were brought
    against parties carrying on business in Ontario. I fail to see how TAP’s decision
    to institute those proceedings can fairly be interpreted as an attornment to
    Ontario in the Underlying Action, which was predicated upon offshore agreements
    and transactions involving foreign corporations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor does the responding parties’ decision to
    bring a security for costs motion in this appeal assist the moving parties. Attornment
    occurs where a party takes steps suggesting they have accepted jurisdiction, which
    typically are “steps to defend the merits of a proceeding”: Gerard J. Kennedy,
    “Jurisdiction Motions and Access to Justice: An Ontario Tale” (2018) 55 Osgoode
    Hall L.J. 79, at p. 103. Attornment does not occur where a party merely
    contests the jurisdiction of the court: <em>Lilydale Cooperative Ltd. v. Meyn
    Canada Inc.</em>, 2019 ONCA 761, 439 D.L.R. (4th) 385, at para. 52. Nor does it
    occur where a party takes procedural steps that deal solely with the procedural
    mechanics of the jurisdiction hearing: <em>Fraser v. 4358376 Canada Inc.</em>, 2014
    ONCA 553, 324 O.A.C. 68, at para. 15.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the responding parties’ motion for
    security for costs in this jurisdiction appeal is a procedural step related to
    the resolution of the jurisdictional dispute the appeal addresses. It cannot be
    taken as an act of attornment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The decisions relied upon by the moving parties
    do not hold otherwise. In <em>T Films S.A. v. Cinemavault Releasing
    International Inc.</em>, 2014 ONSC 4138, the motion by the respondents for
    security for costs constituted attornment because it related to the costs of the
    underlying proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor is there help to be found in the endorsement
    in <em>1092072 Ontario Inc. (Elfe Juvenile Products) v. GCan Insurance Co.</em>,
    2008 CanLII 51922 (Ont. S.C.). McWatt J.’s <em>obiter dictum</em><i> </i>observation,
    at para. 15, that a security for costs motion would be an act of attornment concerned
    a hypothetical motion related to the substantive underlying action. Indeed,
    McWatt J. later held, at para. 18, that a party who “disputes jurisdiction” without
    engaging in the “merits” of the case will not generally be found to attorn. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(e)     Conclusion on the Stay Motion</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> It is not in the interests of justice to stay pending
    appeal the motion judge’s order to permanently stay the Underlying Action. I am
    not persuaded that the moving parties will be irrevocably harmed if the
    requested stay pending appeal is denied, and I am persuaded that the balance of
    convenience favours the responding parties. Although the issues to be adjudicated
    on the appeal are not frivolous or vexatious, the grounds of appeal are not so
    strong as to compensate for the weaknesses I have identified in the other <em>RJR-MacDonald</em><i> </i>factors. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would therefore deny the motion for a stay

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I see no urgency in having this appeal heard. The
    moving parties’ request for an expedited appeal was presented, at least in

    the responding parties. No stay pending appeal is being ordered, and the responding
    parties oppose expedition.</span></p>
