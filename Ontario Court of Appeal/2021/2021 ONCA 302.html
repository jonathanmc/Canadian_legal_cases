    October 31, 2018 and the sentence imposed on January 11, 2019, with reasons
    reported at 2019 ONSC 358, by Justice Alfred J. O’Marra of the Superior Court
    of Justice.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Jamal J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Taylor Griffith, was convicted of
    offences related to the unlawful possession of a loaded semi-automatic handgun with
    a chambered round ready to fire and possession of crack and powder cocaine <span
style='color:black'>for the purpose of trafficking</span>. He was sentenced to 6
    years in prison and various ancillary orders, less credit for pre-sentence
    custody calculated at 22 months, requiring him to serve another 4 years and 2
    months. He now appeals his conviction and seeks leave to appeal his sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The main issue on the conviction appeal is
    whether the trial judge erred in dismissing an application to exclude the evidence
    of the handgun and drugs found on the appellant when he was searched incident
    to arrest. The trial judge found the police had objectively reasonable grounds
    to arrest the appellant in all the circumstances, including their previous observations
    of hand-to-hand transactions of suspected drug trafficking. He also held — and
    the Crown conceded — that the police breached the appellant’s right to counsel
    under s. 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em> by delaying his access to counsel for
    several hours while they executed search warrants at his apartment and storage
    locker. <span style='color:black'>At the same time, the </span>trial judge ruled
    that the police had case-specific concerns for officer safety and evidence
    preservation that justified delaying access to counsel until the search
    warrants were executed. The trial judge declined to exclude the evidence under
    s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. He also declined to reduce the appellant’s
    sentence because of the s.&nbsp;10(b) breach.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>For the reasons that </span><span
lang=EN-CA>follow, I would dismiss the conviction and sentence appeals. I agree
    with the trial judge that the police had objectively reasonable grounds to
    arrest the appellant and to search him incident to arrest. I also agree with
    the trial judge that the police breached s. 10(b) by delaying access to counsel,
    but as I explain below, I would find the breach to have been briefer than the
    trial judge found. The police were justified in delaying access to counsel while
    they executed the search warrants because of the case-specific concerns for
    officer safety that the trial judge himself found. This delay in accessing
    counsel therefore did not breach s. 10(b). However, the further unexplained delay
    in accessing counsel, of one hour and twenty minutes after the search warrants were
    executed, did breach s. 10(b). Despite this breach of s. 10(b) — which appears to
    have been unintentional and situation-specific rather than systemic — I would
    not exclude the evidence under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. I also see no
    basis to interfere with the trial judge’s assessment that the s. 10(b) breach did
    not warrant a sentence reduction.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police received information from a
    confidential informant that the appellant was selling drugs on Eglinton Avenue
    West in Toronto in an area known to have drug trafficking problems. A team of
    four plain-clothes officers from the Major Crime Unit of the Toronto Police
    Service — Detective Constables Quinlan, Mignardi, McCartney, and Pollard —
    placed the appellant under surveillance. The officers were trained and
    experienced in drug investigations and had seen many street-level drug deals.
    They followed and watched the appellant on October 10, 11, 21, and 24, 2017.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The surveillance was challenging because the appellant
    jumped fences and habitually used alleyways rather than main streets. The
    officers perceived the appellant to <span style='color:black'>be conscious of </span>surveillance.
    D.C. Mignardi described his “head [as] always on a swivel”.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>October 10</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 10, 2017, D.C.s Mignardi and
    McCartney followed the appellant as he left a library on Eglinton Avenue West
    carrying a satchel. He went down a laneway, over a fence, and used a key to
    enter an apartment building. The officers were familiar with the apartment building
    because they had received complaints that some tenants allowed drug users to consume
    drugs in their units and they had made several drug arrests there. The landlord
    had even given the police a key to the building because of concerns about drug trafficking.
    D.C.s Quinlan and Mignardi testified that they had been in the building “a lot”.
    D.C. Quinlan said he had conducted three or four drug investigations there that
    led to arrests.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>October 11</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The next day, D.C. Quinlan went back to the
    building. He went to a third&#8209;floor apartment that the confidential informant
    told the police that the appellant occupied and he saw the appellant leave the apartment.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>October 21</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 21, 2017, D.C. Mignardi monitored the
    appellant as he sat on a park bench in a parkette. She was about 20 meters away
    from the appellant and out of sight. The appellant was talking on his
    cellphone. She saw two men approach him on bicycles and interact with him for
    about 30 seconds. She recognized them both as suspected drug users and had seen
    them in the area — one of them daily, panhandling. She knew one of them lived
    in a house full of drug users because she had been in the house twice and had
    seen him inside with crack pipes and drugs scattered around. At first, the men on
    bicycles had their hands in their pockets and then completed a hand-to-hand
    transaction with the appellant, lasting “like a second”, in which their fists were
    slightly clenched, their hands met, and there was “sort of a … swap”. It was
    not a fist-bump, but a “sort of handshake where the palms swiped together”. D.C.
    Mignardi saw no money or drugs and heard no conversation. The two men then rode
    away in the direction they had come, and the appellant immediately got up and walked
    away.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>D.C. Mignardi was convinced the two men had just
    bought drugs from the appellant. She had seen about 50 hand-to-hand drug
    transactions in her career. She had also just completed a drug-investigation
    training course the week before, including on what to look for in hand-to-hand
    transactions — it matched what she had just seen.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>D.C. Quinlan came to assist D.C. Mignardi at the
    parkette. He was about 100 metres away. He saw the two men on bicycles ride by.
    He knew one of them by name as a suspected drug user because he had seized a
    crack pipe from him once before and often saw him panhandling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>D.C. Mignardi testified that she believed she
    now had grounds to arrest the appellant for drug possession and possession <span
style='color:black'>for the purpose of trafficking</span>. The officers decided
    not to arrest the appellant that night, however, because they wanted to
    continue the investigation and planned to seek a search warrant. D.C. Mignardi
    testified that the police wanted to “see what [the appellant] was up to” and to
    learn “where he was keeping his product” and “if there was more product”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police continued to follow the appellant
    that evening. He went into a laundromat and came out carrying a garbage bag of
    clothes. They then followed him to a storage locker, which he left empty-handed
    after less than 20 minutes.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>October 24</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 24, 2017, D.C. Mignardi drafted two search
    warrant applications: one for the appellant’s apartment and one for the storage
    locker. The police planned to arrest him and then to execute the search warrants
    when they had him in custody.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The officers tracked down the appellant in
    mid-afternoon and saw him enter a John Howard Society building. They <span
style='color:black'>decided to arrest </span>him based on the hand-to-hand
    transactions they had seen three days earlier. They tried to locate him in the
    building but could not find him. They then saw him leave the building carrying
    a bag and followed him into a laneway. After a brief struggle in which the
    appellant tried to escape, D.C.s McCartney and Mignardi arrested the appellant
    at 3:55 p.m.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During the struggle as the appellant was
    arrested, D.C. Mignardi saw a handgun in the waistband of his pants and seized it
    incident to arrest. It turned out to be a loaded semi-automatic handgun with a
    chambered round ready to fire and 11 more rounds in the magazine.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police also searched the appellant’s bag
    incident to arrest and found over an ounce of crack and powder cocaine, $440 in
    cash, and his identification.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The officers called for a marked police cruiser
    so that the appellant could be videotaped as he was read his rights. He was
    placed in a marked cruiser at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. At 4:03 p.m., the appellant was advised
    of his right to counsel, as recorded on the in-car camera. He was asked, “Do
    you want to call a lawyer now?” He replied, “Yes”, and told the officer the
    name of his lawyer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was then transported to the police
    station. At 4:25 p.m., as he was being processed, an officer reminded the
    appellant of his right to counsel. The appellant reiterated that he wanted to
    speak to the lawyer he had named. The officer told the appellant that the
    police would try to contact his lawyer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Meanwhile, the police executed the search warrants.
    They drove to the storage locker, which was about 15 minutes’ drive away, and searched
    it, beginning at 5:07 p.m. The search took just two minutes. They then took
    photographs and secured the scene. Next, they drove to the appellant’s apartment,
    and searched it from 5:50 p.m. until 6:20 p.m. They found nothing of
    consequence at either place. They then returned to the police station at 6:28
    p.m.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At 7:40 p.m. — three hours and forty-five
    minutes after the appellant’s arrest and an hour and twenty minutes after the search
    warrants had been executed — the appellant <span style='color:black'>was
    allowed to </span>speak to his lawyer. <span style='color:black'>At no time </span>did
    the police explain to the appellant the reason for the delay in accessing
    counsel.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the start of trial, the trial judge dismissed
    an application to exclude the evidence of the gun and drugs seized incident to
    arrest: <em>R. v. Griffith</em>, 2018 ONSC 6471. The trial judge ruled: (1) the
    police had objectively reasonable grounds to arrest the appellant, and thus did
    not violate his right not to be detained arbitrarily under s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>;
    (2) the warrantless search of the appellant was a lawful search incident to
    arrest, and thus did not breach his right against unreasonable search or

    police conduct in delaying access to counsel and failing to inform the
    appellant of the reason for the delay, while not done in bad faith, was
    “serious misconduct” that favoured excluding the evidence; (2) the delay in
    accessing counsel “had minimal negative impact” on the appellant and there was
    “no causal or indeed temporal connection between the s. 10(b) breach and the
    evidence obtained”, which mitigated the impact of the breach on his <em>Charter</em>-protected
    interests; and (3) the evidence seized was reliable and crucial to the
    prosecution of very serious offences. Balancing the seriousness of the breach,
    the minimal negative impact on the appellant’s <em>Charter</em>-protected
    interests, and society’s interest in the adjudication of these offences on the

    transactions, lasting less than 30 seconds, which did not appear to be a

    summarized D.C. Mignardi’s evidence as being that the men extended “their arms with
    clenched fists as if holding something and then swiping or sliding their palms
    together”, which she believed based on her training and experience to be
    “exchanging money for drugs”. The two men on bikes immediately rode away in the

    so much so the landlord had given the police a key to the building because of these
    concerns; and (3) she knew the two men on bikes as suspected drug users, and
    her colleague, D.C. Quinlan, knew one man by name as a suspected drug user.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant relies on <em>R. v. Brown</em>,
    2012 ONCA 225, 286 C.C.C. (3d) 481, as he did <span style='color:black'>at
    trial, </span>to support his claim that D.C. Mignardi lacked objectively justifiable
    reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him. As the trial judge noted,
    however, the facts in <em>Brown</em> were “quite different” from this case. In <em>Brown</em>,
    two police officers were on general patrol in a police cruiser. They <span
style='color:black'>had no prior knowledge of either of the participants </span>in
    a suspected drug transaction on a street corner. One officer — but not the
    other — saw the suspected seller, the accused, extend his arm as if to hand
    over some drugs, but the suspected buyer did not reciprocate and instead walked
    away abruptly. On these facts, this court concluded that the officer’s
    observations did not “provide any objective basis upon which to believe that
    the two persons were engaged in a drug transaction”: at para. 15.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, however, the officers investigating the
    appellant <span style='color:black'>had prior knowledge about him </span>and
    the two suspected drug purchasers and they had had the appellant under surveillance
    for several days. On these facts, I see no error in the trial judge’s
    conclusion that D.C. Mignardi had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the
    appellant without a warrant. A reasonable person standing in the shoes of D.C.&nbsp;Mignardi,
    with the same training and experience as her in investigating drug cases and
    seeing hand-to-hand transactions, and with the same knowledge of her
    surveillance of the appellant and what she had seen in the parkette, could in
    all the circumstances reasonably believe that drug transactions had occurred. The
    arrest was therefore lawful and the police did not breach s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It follows from my conclusion that the
    appellant’s arrest was lawful that the search incident to that arrest was also lawful.
    The appellant does not argue otherwise. The police could search the appellant incident
    to arrest to locate and preserve evidence and to ensure the safety of the
    police, the public, and the appellant — particularly when D.C. Mignardi saw a
    handgun in the waistband of his pants as he was arrested: see <em>Cloutier v.
    Langlois</em>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 158, at p.&nbsp;186; <em>R. v. Golden</em>, 2001

    2010 SCC 24, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 851, at para. 49. The police thus did not breach

    justified in delaying the appellant’s access to counsel. As I will elaborate, both <span style='color:black'>at trial </span>and on appeal, the Crown conceded
    that the breach of s. 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em> lasted from when the appellant
    was arrested, at 3:55 p.m., to 7:40 p.m. — a delay of three hours and
    forty-five minutes, or one hour and twenty minutes after both search warrants had
    been executed at 6:20 p.m. <span style='color:black'>At the same time, </span>the
    Crown sought to uphold the trial judge’s factual finding that the police had
    case-specific concerns for officer safety and the preservation of evidence that
    justified them delaying access to counsel until after the searches were
    completed. The Crown appeared to view these case&#8209;specific concerns as
    mitigating the overall seriousness of the breach. The appellant agreed with the
    Crown as to the duration of the s. 10(b) breach, but disagreed <span
style='color:black'>that </span>there were any case-specific concerns for
    officer safety or the preservation of evidence that justified the delay in accessing

    find on the evidence that the officers had case-specific concerns about officer
    safety that justified delaying access to counsel until they completed the
    searches. Based on that finding, however, I would hold that the initial delay until
    the completion of the searches at 6:20 p.m. did not infringe s. 10(b). The
    subsequent delay in implementing the right to counsel, from 6:20 p.m. until

    Doherty J.A. explained in <em>Rover</em> — decided almost a year after the

    “only after turning their mind to the specifics of the circumstances and
    concluding, on some reasonable basis, that police or public safety, or the need
    to preserve evidence, justifies some delay in granting access to counsel”: <em>Rover</em>,

    for evidence preservation and police safety and submitted that the court should
    consider this in assessing the seriousness of the breach under s. 24(2).
    Defence counsel <span style='color:black'>at trial </span>(not appellate
    counsel) did not suggest a different analytical approach. Before this court,
    appellate Crown counsel adopted the same approach, stating in her factum that
    “the police decision to delay the appellant’s access to counsel until the
    search warrants were executed constituted a violation of s. 10(b)”. Counsel for
    the appellant agreed.</span></p>

    approach. He found that the police had case-specific concerns that justified
    delaying the appellant’s right to counsel “in consideration of police/public
    safety and the preservation of evidence”. He summarized D.C. Quinlan’s testimony
    as being <span style='color:black'>that </span>there were “heightened concerns
    regarding police safety given the arrest involved an accused who possessed a
    loaded firearm, and they did not know if the apartment they were to search,
    where they suspected drugs to be present, was occupied by others”. The trial

    paras. 18, 26-27. He added, however, that the police must have case-specific
    evidence that the police turned their minds to the circumstances <span
style='color:black'>of the case </span>before delaying access to counsel: at
    paras. 32-33. More recently, in <em>Leonard</em>, this court confirmed that a

    justify suspending the constitutional right to counsel. He relies on D.C. Pollard’s
    evidence of the police’s “general practice” of delaying access to counsel until
    after the execution of a search warrant and D.C. Quinlan’s characterization of that
    practice as “just smart policing”. D.C. Quinlan also testified that it is

    where [the appellant is] able to phone whoever he wants when he’s at [the
    police station]”. She also testified that the team had “specifically
    consider[ed] safety issues when a decision was made to arrest [the appellant]
    before the execution of the search warrants so that his rights would be
    suspended until the search warrants [were] executed”. She noted that searches were
    to be conducted at two locations — the storage locker and the apartment — which
    raised particular safety concerns if the appellant could telephone somebody
    before both searches were completed. D.C. Quinlan similarly testified that the
    officer safety concerns were “heightened” by the firearm recovered from the
    appellant. He highlighted <span style='color:black'>that </span>this was not a
    large operation and included only four officers. Cumulatively, this testimony
    provided an evidentiary basis for the trial judge’s conclusion that the police had
    a reasonable basis to conclude that concerns for officer-safety justified delaying
    access to counsel until the searches were completed.</span></p>

    was relatively close in time to the s. 10(b) breach and part of the continuum
    of events arising from the appellant’s arrest: see <em>Pino </em>at para. 74.
    The connection was also contextual because the discovery of the evidence arose out

    another officer that the appellant wanted to contact his lawyer. At 7:40 p.m., she
    helped him to do so. She then returned to inputting information in the police
    computer system. She testified that the police did not set out to intentionally
    delay the appellant’s right to counsel and there was no advantage to the

    rights is itself determinative. I simply highlight that the only evidence in

    at para. 79; <em>McSweeney</em>, at para. 81. Reliable evidence critical to the

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Balancing the factors</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The final step in the s. 24(2) analysis involves
    balancing the factors under the three lines of inquiry to assess the impact of
    admission or exclusion of the evidence on the long-term repute of the
    administration of justice. Such balancing involves a qualitative exercise, one
    that is not capable of mathematical precision: <em>Harrison</em>, at para. 36.
    As Doherty J.A. recently noted in <em>Hobeika</em>, “[t]he nature of the s.
    24(2) inquiry means, in some cases, different judges will reasonably arrive at
    different conclusions with respect to admissibility”: at para. 89.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, I have concluded that the evidence was
    properly admitted under s.&nbsp;24(2). I say this for several reasons. The breach
    of s.&nbsp;10(b), although serious, appears to have been situation-specific and
    isolated, rather than institutional or systemic. It has not been established
    that the breach was deliberate or intentional. The breach only moderately <span
style='color:black'>impacted </span>the appellant’s <em>Charter</em>-protected
    interests. The evidence, consisting of the loaded gun and drugs, was obtained
    through a lawful search incident to arrest and, because it was not causally
    related to the s.&nbsp;10(b) breach, was not compromised by the breach of s.&nbsp;10(b).
    In these circumstances, excluding the evidence would only punish the police —
    which is not the purpose of s. 24(2) — and would damage, rather than vindicate,
    the long&#8209;term repute of the criminal justice system: <em>Grant</em>, at
    para. 70; <em>Hobeika</em>, at para. 90; and <em>Pileggi</em>, at para. 127. It
    would allow an apparently unintentional, situation-specific police-slip that
    had only a moderate impact on <em>Charter</em>-protected interests to lead to
    the acquittal of an armed and dangerous drug trafficker in a city already
    plagued by gun violence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Like the trial judge, I thus conclude that the admission

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred by declining to reduce the sentence he imposed (6 years, less
    credit for pre-sentence custody calculated at 22 months) because of the s.
    10(b) violations. The appellant was 22 years old when he committed the
    offences.</span></p>

    (1) if the sentence is demonstrably unfit; or (2) if the sentencing judge made
    an error in principle that had an impact on the sentence: </span><em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant does not argue that the sentence
    was demonstrably unfit. Instead, he submits that the trial judge’s refusal to reduce
    the sentence because of the s. 10(b) breach was an error in principle that
    justifies appellate intervention. As he did at first instance, the appellant
    relies on the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <em>R. v. Nasogaluak</em>,
    2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. <span style='color:black'>206, in support of </span>his
    submission. That case upheld a sentence reduction for the offences of impaired
    driving and flight from the police when the police used excessive force in
    arresting the accused and breached his <em>Charter</em> rights during his
    arrest and detention. Here, by analogy, the appellant asserts that the s. 10(b)
    breach was contextually and temporally connected to his arrest and thus
    warranted a sentence reduction.</span></p>

    all the circumstances of the offence and offender. This includes state
    misconduct, including a <em>Charter</em> breach, if it relates to the
    circumstances of the offence and the offender. When, however, the state
    misconduct does not relate to the circumstances of the offence or the offender,
    the accused cannot seek a remedy through the sentencing process: <em>Nasogaluak</em>,
    at paras. 3-4, 46-49; <em>R. v. Donnelly</em>, 2016 ONCA 988, 135 O.R. (3d)

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, the trial judge considered <em>Nasogaluak </em>but
    determined that the circumstances of the s. 10(b) breach did not relate to the offences
    or the offender <span style='color:black'>in a way that could be </span>considered
    in sentencing. He held there was no additional harm or prejudice caused by the
    s. 10(b) breach that would act as a mitigating circumstance. He referred to his
    ruling on the <em>Charter </em>application that the discovery of the evidence was
    not causally connected to the breach, and thus did “not align with the offences
    or to the offender”. In support of that conclusion, he cited <em>R. v. Glykis</em> (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 803 (C.A.), which also involved a s. 10(b) breach arising
    from a delay in accessing counsel. Dubin C.J.O. held that the s. 10(b) breach in
    that case should not reduce the sentence because it did not mitigate the
    seriousness of the offence or constitute a form of additional punishment or
    hardship for the accused.</span></p>

    His conclusion that the s. 10(b) breach did not relate to the circumstances of
    the offences or the offender to affect the appropriate sentence is reasonable.
    The breach of s. 10(b) did not alter the circumstances of the offences.
    Although the delay in accessing counsel no doubt had some effect on the
