    Full of Spoons Inc., Parktown Studios Inc. and Richard Stewart Towns (together
    “Room Full of Spoons”) </span>for security for the trial judgment, costs of the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The security amounts are as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Security for the trial judgment in the amount of
    $200,000 CDN and Canadian currency sufficient to purchase $575,488.36 at a bank
    in Ontario listed in Schedule I to the <em>Bank Act</em> (Canada) at the close

    security for judgment has not been awarded by an Ontario court, the unique
    circumstances of this case warrant security for the judgment awarded and has
    been awarded by courts in other Canadian jurisdictions. Room Full of Spoons
    also notes that the British Columbia and Alberta courts have granted security
    for judgment in similar circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND EVIDENCE</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2003, Wiseau Studio LLC and Tommy Wiseau,
    doing business as “Wiseau Films” released a feature film called The Room. The
    Room and its creator, Tommy Wiseau, acquired cult-like status. Wiseau Studio
    and Tommy Wiseau are residents of California.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Richard Harper, Fernando Forero McGrath, Martin
    Racicot and Richard Stewart Towns are Ontario documentary filmmakers. In 2016,
    after years of work, they completed a documentary film called <em>Room Full of
    Spoons</em> about the cult phenomenon surrounding The Room and Mr. Wiseau (the
    “Documentary”). Room Full of Spoons’ only material asset is the Documentary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Room Full of Spoons have not been able to
    exploit the Documentary since Wiseau Films brought a claim against them in
    2017.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 14, 2017, Wiseau Films obtained an <em>ex
    parte</em> injunction restraining the release of the Documentary while,
    unbeknownst to the court, it was in negotiations with Room Full of Spoons about
    the Documentary’s release.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 1, 2017, the injunction was
    dissolved as the motion judge held that Wiseau Films had failed to make full
    and frank disclosure and engaged in litigation misconduct. Room Full of Spoons
    was awarded substantial indemnity costs of $97,034.68.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The cost award was not paid for 11 months and
    was paid only after the court advised that Wiseau Films’ claim would be
    dismissed if the cost award was not satisfied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thereafter, the case management judge found that
    Wiseau Films engaged in “roadblocks to scheduling at almost every attendance”
    and other improper acts. These include:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(a)     The injunction was issued at a
    “commercially critical time” when the parties were on the verge of finalizing a
    distribution deal which was prevented by the injunction such that the lawsuit
    had the effect of blocking the release of the documentary;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(b)     Wiseau stated falsehoods about the
    defendants on social media and made misrepresentation to third parties about
    the legality of screening the documentary;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(c)     Both sides agreed to file affidavits
    from their witnesses regarding their anticipated testimony in chief.
    Thereafter, Wiseau Films sought an order from the case management judge to
    direct the Crown to prosecute the defendants for perjury based on their
    affidavits, although he never identified what was allegedly false. The request
    was refused;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(d)     Seeking to adjourn the trial on the
    eve of trial on the grounds that Wiseau Films no longer had counsel. The case
    management judge held this was “a situation entirely of their own making and
    one about which [he had] warned Mr. Wiseau on many occasions”. Since February
    2019, the case management judge had dealt with three different motions by three
    sets of counsel for Wiseau Films asking to be removed from the record; and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(e)     On the eve of trial, sending the judge
    and opposing counsel a document entitled “Total Withdraw” purporting to
    discontinue his claims. In the document, Wiseau Films attacked the Ontario
    justice system and stated that a new action would be brought in another
    jurisdiction for the same relief. (The request was refused.)</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following an eight-day trial in January 2020,
    Wiseau Films’ claim was dismissed and judgment granted in favour of Room Full
    of Spoons on the counterclaim. The judgment was thorough and comprehensive.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Room Full of Spoons was awarded $200,000 in
    punitive damages (in large part for litigation misconduct), $550,000 USD in
    damages arising from the improper <em>ex parte</em><i> </i>injunction,
    $25,488.36 USD in pre-judgment interest, and $481,521.80&nbsp;CDN in costs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thereafter, Wiseau Films’ request to vary the
    judgment was dismissed with costs to Room Full of Spoons in the amount of
    $20,000 CDN. In his reasons, the trial judge refused to allow evidence from
    witnesses that testified at trial and that could and should have been adduced
    at trial. He also noted that,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Nothing presented on this motion suggests that
    my Reasons for Judgment were based on misleading evidence or that there is any
    other reason to reconsider my decision or reopen the trial. Rather, this motion
    raises the same concerns referred to by Koehnen J. prior to trial, that the
    plaintiffs seek to delay justice for the defendants at every turn.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Once again, Wiseau also complains of the
    Ontario justice system being unfair to him as “an American citizen doing
    litigation in a foreign and unfamiliar jurisdiction.” This claim, and other
    criticisms of the Ontario courts was made by Wiseau in advance of trial and
    also at the outset of the trial. However, Wiseau chose to bring this action in
    Ontario, and no doubt was quite content with our system of justice when he
    obtained his <em>ex parte</em> injunction. I am not aware of any way in which
    he has been treated differently than if he were a resident of Ontario or a
    citizen of Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, this motion has no merit and is
    yet another tactical attempt by Wiseau to delay and obstruct the release of <em>Room
    Full of Spoons</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thereafter, Mr. Wiseau failed to attend
    examinations in aid of execution, or court Orders compelling his attendance to
    provide information about his assets. Counsel for Wiseau Films advised that,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As for the location of the assets which could
    be used to satisfy any judgment … the bulk of my clients’ assets may be located
    outside Ontario, namely in the USA. As you are aware, should you wish to
    proceed with execution against any US-based assets, the proper procedure for
    your side would be to convince a US court of proper jurisdiction to endorse the
    judgments and orders issued by the Ontario courts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Wiseau refused to say whether a sizeable
    real estate asset called the Pico Property, which was the only known address
    for Mr. Wiseau, was still his address and said it was “laughable” to ask. No
    information has been provided about any Wiseau Films assets or their
    whereabouts save for the bald assertion that Wiseau Films can satisfy any
    judgment award.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Wiseau Films has now brought a Notice of Appeal
    of the trial judgment. Wiseau Films’ counsel does not dispute that the Amended
    Amended Notice of Appeal, which grounds provide only that the court below erred
    in dismissing his various claims, is frivolous on its face. He suggested
    however that there was still time to further amend the Appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Room Full of Spoons</span> claims costs of the judgment and security
    for costs of the trial and appeal on the grounds that there is no evidence that
    Wiseau Films or any of its assets is in the jurisdiction or that Wiseau Films
    would agree to pay any order of this court. Room Full of Spoons also submits
    that Wiseau Films’ improper behaviour in making numerous tactical attempts to
    obstruct and delay these proceedings, and its frivolous appeal, justify the
    relief sought.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Room Full of Spoons claims these actions are
    clear evidence that, having chosen to commence legal proceedings in Ontario,
    Wiseau Films does not intend to comply with an Ontario court order and that
    security for judgment and costs is therefore required.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Wiseau Films disputes the motion for security
    for judgment and/or costs as they claim justice does not demand that security
    be granted and the losing party should be entitled to avail itself of due
    process and any and all protections afforded to a judgment debtor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for Wiseau Films conceded on this motion
    that the grounds of appeal set out in the Notice of Appeal are frivolous as
    they are entirely conclusory. He stated however, that they are not vexatious as
    there is no stated intention to refuse to pay any amounts deemed owing nor is
    there evidence Wiseau Films cannot satisfy a judgment and or costs award.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lastly, Wiseau Films submits that to enable Room
    Full of Spoons to obtain information about its assets would constitute
    execution before final judgment. Such an order for security for judgment has
    never been granted in Ontario, which suggests it is not appropriate to do so
    absent exceptional circumstances which are not present in this case.</span></p>

    provides that “In an appeal or other matter before the court, a justice may …
    (b) make an interim order to prevent prejudice to any person”. The court
    ordered that appellants who resided out of the jurisdiction without assets in
    the jurisdiction post security for the trial judgment, failing which the
    respondents were granted leave to apply to have the appeal dismissed as
    abandoned. In so doing, the court set out the principles governing the exercise
    of discretion in ordering security for a trial judgment:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The onus is on the applicant to show that it is in the interest of

  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant must show prejudice if the order

    chambers judge should consider the merits of the appeal and the effect of such
    an order on the ability of the appellant to continue the appeal. (See also <em>Vaillancourt</em>,
    at para. 24).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The interests of justice may include a
    consideration of the <em>ex juris</em><i> </i>residence of an appellant and
    therefore the effective immunity of an appellant from enforcement of the
    judgment: <em>First Majestic Silver Corp. et al.</em>,<i> </i>at para. </span><span
lang=FR>16; <em>Paz v. Hardouin</em>, 1995 CanLII 1808 (B.C. C.A.), at paras. </span><span
lang=EN-CA>22. They may also include a consideration of the ability to enforce
    the judgment in the appellant’s <em>ex&nbsp;juris</em><i> </i>jurisdiction
    and/or the absence of assets in the jurisdiction in which the judgment was
    rendered: <em>First Majestic Silver Corp. et al.</em>,<i> </i>at para. 16; <em>Cadinha

    J.A. held at para. 12 that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[A]dverse financial circumstances will
    generally not defeat an application for security where an appeal is virtually
    without any merit. A successful plaintiff should not be required to respond to

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A finding that an appeal has no reasonable
    prospect of success may be a factor: see <em>Richland Construction Inc.</em>, at
    para. 8.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons set out below, I find that this
    is one of those rare and exceptional circumstances where an order for security
    for judgment is warranted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, Wiseau Films is out of the jurisdiction.
    Wiseau Films refused to advise if it has any assets in the jurisdiction and the
    only reasonable inference therefore is that there is no evidence that Wiseau
    Films have any assets in the jurisdiction. Moreover, Wiseau Films concedes
    there is no issue that paying security for judgment and or costs would prevent
    Wiseau Films from pursuing its appeal. As such, the interest of justice onus is
    met.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, there is evidence that Room Full of
    Spoons will suffer prejudice if the order is not granted:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>On several occasions, both the case management and trial judges have
    noted that there were numerous “tactical attempt(s) by Wiseau to delay and
    obstruct the release of Room Full of Spoons.” Those actions are set out at
    paragraph 10 above;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Room Full of Spoons spent years producing their
    documentary film and it has now been over four years since the completion of
    the film during which there has been a cloud on title such that they have been
    prevented from airing the documentary;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A significant judgment award may never be
    recovered if the order is not granted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although Wiseau decided to commence legal
    proceedings in Ontario (and is therefore required to abide by the rules of the
    Ontario courts), Wiseau Films has demonstrated no intention to pay an award
    ordered by this court. Mr. Wiseau said it was “laughable” to ask if the
    sizeable Pico Property, which was the only known address for Mr. Wiseau, was
    still his address and suggests that if his appeal is not successful, Room Full
    of Spoons should commence proceedings in the United States to recover the
    judgment. It is also telling that, although Wiseau Films did pay the costs
    ordered against him for bringing an improper <em>ex parte</em> order, he did so
    only after the court ordered that if he failed to pay the award, his action
    would be dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, it is agreed that as presently drafted,
    the Amended Amended Notice of Appeal is frivolous and does not articulate what
    errors were made in the comprehensive reasons provided by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I am therefore satisfied that although this is a
    remedy that should be invoked sparingly, the interests of justice weigh in
    favour of granting the order for security for judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the appellants are ordered to post
    security for the trial judgment within 90 days of this order, with liberty to
    apply for further directions on the form of the security, if necessary. If the
    appellants fail to comply with this order, Room Full of Spoons are granted
    leave to apply for an order dismissing the appeal as abandoned.</span></p>

    that, having elected to proceed in Ontario, it would pay any amounts ordered by
    Ontario courts unless and until ordered by a United States court. Moreover,
    there is evidence that the proceeding is vexatious given the circumstances
    surrounding the <em>ex parte</em> order, the conduct prior to trial set out
    above, and Wiseau Films’ concession that the appeal is frivolous.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Taken together, there are ample grounds to
