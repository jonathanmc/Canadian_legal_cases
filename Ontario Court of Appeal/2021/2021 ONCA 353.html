  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Benotto J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Robin Cirillo, sought to certify
    a class proceeding claiming redress for the Crown’s failure to hold timely bail
    hearings for accused persons. She based her claims as a representative
    plaintiff on negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and rights under the <em>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</em>. The motion judge dismissed the motion for certification.
    She appeals the order to this Court. She also appeals a second order dealing
    with the application of the <em>Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, 2019</em></span>,
    S.O. 2019, c. 7, Sched. 17<em> </em>(“<em><span lang=EN-CA>CLPA</span></em>”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would dismiss the appeal. The proposed class action
    does not meet the requirements of the <em>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</em>,</span><span
lang=EN> S.O. 1992, c. 6 (“</span><em><span lang=EN-CA>CPA</span></em><span
lang=EN>”)</span><span lang=EN-CA>. There is no cause of action in negligence,
    as the claim attacks core policy decisions insulated from tort liability. The
    appellant did not raise the fiduciary duty issue in written or oral argument. The <em>Charter </em>claims arise from a purported right to a bail hearing within
    24 hours of arrest. Whether or not this right exists, the proposed class
    definition is flawed, there are no common issues, and a class action is not the
    preferable procedure. It is unnecessary to determine whether certification of the
    negligence claims would also be barred by s.11 of the <em>CLPA</em>.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Background</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was arrested on the evening of May
    28, 2017 following an altercation with her ex-spouse during which she allegedly
    brandished a butter knife. No one was injured. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was detained in a holding cell at
    the police station until the next morning when she was taken to the courthouse.
    She says she arrived at approximately 12:30 p.m. She was expecting to be
    released on consent. At 2:47 p.m., when the matter was placed on the court
    docket, duty counsel advised the court that the appellant’s matter could not
    proceed because sureties were being interviewed. The justice of the peace then
    began a contested bail hearing in another matter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The contested bail hearing was interrupted at
    3:25 p.m. by two offers from other courts to traverse matters. There was no
    indication that duty counsel was ready to proceed with the appellant’s hearing.
    Nor was there a request to have her matter traversed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The justice of the peace called the matter at around
    5:24 p.m. Duty counsel advised the court that this was to be a consent release.
    She argued that the court was without jurisdiction to adjourn the matter, since
    neither counsel requested an adjournment, and that a lack of judicial resources
    should not be a reason for an adjournment. Duty counsel conceded that this was
    the earliest the matter could proceed. The justice of the peace rejected duty counsel’s
    submissions and adjourned court for the day, noting that there had been ample
    time for the hearing and that the court was simply out of time for the day. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was transported to detention and
    returned to the court the next day. She was released on consent with multiple
    conditions and surety bail. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The proposed class action</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant commenced this action on behalf of
    herself and the following persons: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[A]ll … persons who were arrested and detained
    for a period of more than 24 hours prior to any Bail Hearing being available as
    a result of:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(a) the matter not being reached;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(b) transportation, or lack thereof, from
    detention to bail hearing;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(c) interpretive services not present at the
    bail hearing;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(d) the accused not having the opportunity to
    speak with counsel prior to arriving at the bail hearing; or</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(f) the Crown not being willing to proceed
    with a hearing; </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>for the time
    period of January 1, 2000 to the present, but excluding individuals charged
    with an offence mentioned in s. 469 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant challenges what she describes as the
    Crown’s operational failure in carrying out its constitutional and statutory
    duty to ensure a bail hearing within 24 hours, as required by the <em>Criminal
    Code </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>and the </span></em><em>Charter</em>.
    She says that the respondent has mismanaged the bail system, failed to provide
    the system with adequate resources, and has promulgated policies for Crown
    prosecutors that have had the effect of increasing the number of people in
    remand. She claims that the Crown’s actions constitute systemic negligence
    against the putative class members. In addition, she argues that the actions of
    the respondent violated the putative class members’ ss. 7, 9, 11(d), 11(e), and
    12 <em>Charter </em>rights. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant seeks declaratory relief,
    including declaratory relief for negligence and breach of <em>Charter</em> rights. For instance, she seeks a declaration that the respondent is liable “for
    the damages caused by its breach of its common law duty in relation to the
    operation, management, administration, supervision, funding and control of bail
    hearings in Ontario”. She also seeks general and punitive damages. </span></p>

  <h6><span lang=EN-CA>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Certification</span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge found that certification should
    be denied because: (i) the pleadings did not disclose a cause of action in
    negligence as the claims are not justiciable; (ii) it is plain and obvious that
    the claims based on breach of fiduciary duty have no prospect of success; (iii)
    the appellant’s claims for breach of <em>Charter</em> rights were not common to
    class members; and (iv) a class proceeding was not the preferable procedure for
    resolution of the class members’ claims. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the appellant’s claims of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty,
    the motion judge first concluded that there could be no cause of action against
    the Crown in its prosecutorial capacity, as the immunity of the Crown as
    prosecutor (except for malicious prosecution) is “deeply entrenched” in law. As
    the claims could not be aimed at the Crown’s actual handling of bail
    proceedings, the causes of action must be aimed at broader decisions related to
    staffing and resource allocation decisions. Such claims require the court to go
    outside of its institutional competence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on <em><span lang=EN-CA>Phaneuf v. Ontario</span></em>, 2010 ONCA 901, 104 O.R.
    (3d) 392, the motion judge concluded that underfunding alone cannot create a
    civil cause of action. He also noted that the impugned government actions were
    “core policy decisions”, as defined in <em>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</em>,
    2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45. As a result, the respondent is immune from liability
    in negligence and the negligence claim is doomed to fail. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge held that the fiduciary claims were also doomed to fail. The issues
    raised by the appellant “provide[d] no basis for fiduciary duties as they do
    not require that any one vulnerable individual be favoured over another”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the motion judge concluded that the only possible cause of action pleaded was
    for breach of <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em> rights. However, he
    concluded that there were no common issues to be certified. The class needed to
    share not simply a common court infrastructure but a common experience of
    having a specific <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em> right violated. In
    this case, that would be difficult to demonstrate given that the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em> breaches alleged (ss. 7, 9, 11(d), 11(e), and
    12) all “share a common thread of reasonableness” and that reasonableness is “a
    difficult standard” to assess as a common issue because the analysis is so fact
    dependent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge outlined the potential for multiple causes of the delay in the
    appellant’s bail hearing. The delay could be attributed to the Toronto Police
    Service (for the delay in transportation), the judge (for adjourning the
    matter), and duty counsel (who needed more time to prepare the appellant’s
    sureties). As a result, the motion judge found that the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em> claims required an individualized assessment of each case and therefore could
    not be certified as a common issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found that there were no common issues, the motion judge found that the
    proposed class action was not the preferable procedure. <span lang=EN>He also
    found that it is “in doubt” whether there is an identifiable class and
    questioned whether the plaintiff was a suitable representative plaintiff. </span></p>
  <h6>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Divisional Court Appeal &amp; the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLPA</span></em></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Cirillo appealed the motion judge’s certification decision to the Divisional
    Court. The week after she served her notice of appeal, the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>CLPA </span></em>came into force. The Crown relied on ss. 11(4) and (5)
    of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLPA</span></em> in its responding factum on appeal
    to argue that certification of the negligence claims was now statute barred. Section
    11(4) provides: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(4) No cause of
    action arises against the Crown or an officer, employee or agent of the Crown
    in respect of any negligence or failure to take reasonable care in the making
    of a decision in good faith respecting a policy matter, or any negligence in a
    purported failure to make a decision respecting a policy matter.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>Section 11(5) defines the term “policy matter”:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(5) For the purposes of subsection
    (4), a policy matter includes,</span></p>

    which the appellant’s <em>Charter</em> and negligence claims are based – that
    there is a “right to” a bail “hearing” within 24 hours – is flawed. Furthermore,

    defining protected policy decisions negatively, as “not operational”, [they are

    whose official responsibility requires them to assess and balance public policy
    considerations. The decision is a considered decision that represents a
    “policy” in the sense of a general rule or approach, applied to a particular
    situation. It represents “a course or principle of action adopted or proposed
    by a government”: <i>New Oxford Dictionary of English</i> (1998), at p. 1434.

    a black-and-white test, the Court concluded that core policy government
    decisions that are protected from suit are “decisions as to a course or

    ignition source of the fire was a cigarette; and, if so, whether it was
    manufactured by the defendant…. For these reasons, I find that the membership

  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>[I]f an issue

    resolved by inquiry into the circumstances of each individual’s claim... The
