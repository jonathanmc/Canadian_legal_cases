<p class=Judge><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class=Judge><strong>Thorburn J.A.:</strong></p>

<p class=Heading>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent, Bibi Saffora Rooplal, was injured while riding a Toronto
Transit Commission (“TTC”) bus. She was told by the bus driver that the
accident was caused by an unidentified motorist.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Ms. Rooplal brought a claim against the unidentified motorist, the TTC,
and the bus driver, Leslie Fodor, for damages resulting from the accident. In
the same action she brought a claim against her insurer, Novex Insurance
Company (“Novex”), for declaratory relief and to indemnify her for damages
caused by the unidentified motorist.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>She later sought to add the appellant Toronto Transit Commission
Insurance (“TTC Insurance”) as a party defendant, seeking declaratory relief
and indemnification for damages caused by the unidentified motorist pursuant to
s. 265 of the <em>Insurance Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 and <em>Uninsured
Automobile Coverage</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 676 (“Regulation 676”). TTC
Insurance took the position that this should not be permitted as the claim against
TTC Insurance was statute-barred by s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>,
S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B (“the <em>Limitations Act</em>”).</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The motion judge permitted the claim against TTC Insurance to proceed on
the basis that the two-year limitation period for commencing a claim set out in
s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act</em> had not expired as, under the criteria set
out in s. 5, Ms.&nbsp;Rooplal had not yet discovered her claim against the
insurer.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The motion judge held that the limitation period for the indemnification
claim against TTC Insurance does not begin to run until “the day after [Ms.
Rooplal] made an indemnification claim which [TTC Insurance] failed to satisfy.
Since [Ms.&nbsp;Rooplal] made her motion to add [TTC Insurance] as a defendant
before making a claim that [TTC Insurance] failed to satisfy, the limitation
period has not expired.” That decision was upheld by the Divisional Court, adopting
the reasons of the motion judge.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Leslie Fodor, the TTC, and TTC Insurance appeal the decision of the
Divisional Court.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The issue on this appeal is when the limitation period begins to run on
the claim for indemnification against TTC Insurance.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>TTC Insurance submits that the limitation period begins to run when Ms.&nbsp;Rooplal
knew or ought to have known the unidentified motorist was at fault. TTC says
this was when she received the police report.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Ms. Rooplal claims the two-year limitation period does not begin to run
until the insurer denies her claim for indemnification under the contract of
insurance. In the alternative, she claims that even if the limitation period
began to run when she knew or ought to have known there was a tort claim
against the unidentified motorist, she did not have evidence of how the
accident happened until the TTC bus driver was examined for discovery. Ms.
Rooplal served her motion to add TTC Insurance less than two years thereafter. Novex
makes no submissions on the appeal.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
the reasons that follow, I find that the limitation period for bringing a claim
against TTC Insurance for declaratory relief and indemnification for damages
caused by the unidentified motorist has not expired.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
conducting the legal analysis, I will briefly outline the underlying accident,
the pleadings, the terms of insurance, and the relevant provisions of the <em>Limitations
Act</em>.</p>

<p class=Heading>BACKGROUND</p>

<h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Accident</h3>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
May 4, 2012, Ms. Rooplal was a passenger in a TTC bus driven by Leslie Fodor.
The bus braked sharply, causing Ms. Rooplal to be propelled forward and strike
her head on an interior bar pole. She was told by the TTC that the bus stopped
suddenly as another car cut it off.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
February 24, 2014, Ms. Rooplal’s counsel received the accident report from the
Toronto Police Service. The report cites the information provided by the TTC
driver and provides that the accident occurred when an unidentified vehicle
caused the TTC bus to brake suddenly to avoid a collision.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
the time of the accident, Ms. Rooplal had a valid motor vehicle insurance
policy with Novex, which included a family protection coverage endorsement
under Ontario Policy Change Form 44R (“OPCF-44R”). TTC was self-insured by TTC
Insurance.</p>

<h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Pleadings</h3>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
March 26, 2014, Ms. Rooplal filed her Statement of Claim against the unidentified
motorist, the unidentified owner, the TTC, and the TTC bus driver for damages
caused by the accident. She also sought a declaration and indemnification from
her insurer, Novex, <span style='line-height:202%'>“</span><span
style='line-height:202%'>up to the full policy limits, including but not
limited to OPCF-44R family protection coverage, for any and all</span><span
style='line-height:202%'> </span><span style='line-height:202%'>damages,
injuries and losses resulting from the motor vehicle accident</span><span
style='line-height:202%'>”.</span> Ms. Rooplal claims she suffered permanent
and serious injuries as a result of the accident and seeks damages in the
amount of $800,000.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
Rooplal claimed that her Family Protection Coverage endorsement with Novex,
under the OPCF-44R, “provides coverage to persons insured under the contract
for loss and injuries sustained as a result of the actions of an unknown
operator of an unidentified motor vehicle pursuant to section 265(1) of the <em>Insurance
Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. 1.8.” She also pleads that “the incident was caused
or contributed to by the negligence of the owner and/or operator of the
[unidentified] Doe Vehicle.”</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
September 11, 2014, Novex served its Statement of Defence and Crossclaim against
the TTC and its driver denying Ms. Rooplal’s claim for unidentified motorist
insurance. At para. 5 of the Statement of Defence (para. 7, in the amended
pleading) Novex pleads that Ms. Rooplal has no “cause of action as against it,
until she obtains judgment as against any of the co-defendants, a determination
is made that any of the co-defendants are uninsured and the plaintiff is unable
to satisfy the said judgment as against the assets of any of the other co&#8209;defendants.”</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
May 7, 2015, examinations for discovery were completed. On December 10, 2015,
counsel for Novex wrote to Ms. Rooplal’s counsel, copying TTC’s counsel, and
stated that “it was my understanding that plaintiff’s counsel would be amending
his client’s claim to include the TTC insurer to the action. Can you please
confirm that this is the case?”</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
March 16, 2017, Novex amended its Statement of Defence and Crossclaim to plead
that:</p>

<p class=CQuote>5. This defendant specifically denies that it is the insurer
for the purposes of coverage for incidents or accidents caused by or
contributed to by the negligence of the owner and/or operator of an
unidentified and/or uninsured motor vehicle.</p>

<p class=CQuote>6. Further, this defendant states that the plaintiff was a
passenger/occupant in the co-defendant TTC vehicle and any claims pursuant to
unidentified and uninsured provisions and/or section 265 of the <em>Insurance
Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 ought to be against the co-defendant TTC
vehicle's policy and not this defendant. [Emphasis omitted.]</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
thereafter, Ms. Rooplal brought a motion to amend her Statement of Claim to add
TTC Insurance as a party defendant. TTC Insurance opposed the motion on the
grounds that the limitation period had expired.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
proposed claim against TTC Insurance is for a declaration that, at the time of
the accident, Ms. Rooplal was an occupant of a vehicle insured by TTC Insurance
and an insured pursuant to that policy, and that TTC Insurance must indemnify
her for all damages caused by the unidentified motorist up to the policy
limits.</p>

<h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Terms of Insurance</h3>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
an unidentified motorist is at fault, there may be no means of securing
compensation for an injury from the unidentified motorist, as the motorist and
the motorist’s insurer may never be identified. In Ontario, there are two means
of addressing this gap in coverage: (i) mandatory uninsured/unidentified motorist
coverage, under s. 265 of the <em>Insurance Act</em>; and (ii) optional OPCF-44R
family protection coverage.</p>

<p class=LHeading11 style='page-break-after:avoid'>Section 265 unidentified
automobile insurance</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
<em>Insurance Act</em> requires that all automobile insurance policies provide
coverage for accidents involving an unidentified motorist. Section 265(1) of
the <em>Insurance Act</em> provides that:</p>

<p class=CQuote>Every contract evidenced by a motor vehicle liability policy
shall provide for <u>payment of all sums that</u>,</p>

<p class=CQuote style='text-indent:0cm'>(a)     <u>a person insured under the contract
is legally entitled to recover</u> from the owner or driver of an uninsured
automobile or <u>unidentified automobile as damages for bodily injuries</u>
resulting from an accident involving an automobile; …</p>

<p class=CQuote><u>subject to the terms, conditions, provisions, exclusions and
limits as are prescribed by the regulations</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
265(2) of the <em>Insurance Act</em> defines “person insured under the
contract” for the purpose of a claim for bodily injuries as, among other
things, “any person while an occupant of the insured automobile”.</p>

<p class=Heading><span style='font-weight:normal'>Regulation 676 of the
Insurance Act</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[25]<span

676 sets out additional obligations on insureds seeking to pursue a claim for
indemnification pursuant to s. 265 <em>Insurance Act</em> in the attached Schedule
“Uninsured Automobile Coverage” (“the Schedule”): R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 676.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[26]<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
motion judge referred to<em> July v. Neal</em> (1986), 32 D.L.R. (4th) 463 (Ont.
C.A.), a case heard before the changes to the <em>Limitations Act</em>. July
was a passenger in a three-party collision including an unidentified motorist. MacKinnon
A.C.J.O, for the majority, held that the limitation period began when “the cause
of action against the insurer arose” meaning “when the material facts on which
the claim is based have been discovered or ought to have been discovered by the
plaintiff by the exercise of reasonable diligence”: p. 469.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

of the <em>Limitations Act</em>.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
referred to<em> Markel Insurance Company of Canada v. ING Insurance Company of

the limitation period under s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act </em>in the context
of the <em>Insurance Act</em>. <em>Markel</em> was a loss-transfer claim
between two insurers, for indemnification for statutory accident benefits paid
to an insured. In that case, the limitation period did not begin until the
first insurer’s request for indemnification was received by the second insurer.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She

leave to appeal refused, [2014] S.C.C.A. No. 143, a case involving an insured’s
claim against their own insurer under the OPCF-44R endorsement. The court in <em>Schmitz</em>
held that the reasoning in <em>Markel</em> was “dispositive” of the limitations
issue s<span style='line-height:202%;color:black'>uch that claim for indemnity
under the OPCF-44R did not start to run until there is a demand for indemnity

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
reviewing the changes in the law, the motion judge observed, at para.&nbsp;29, that:</p>

<p class=CQuote><u>The <i>Limitations Act</i> discoverability provisions are
based upon the common law principles of discoverability. However, the statute
provides a discoverability definition that is much more nuanced and complex.</u>
The detailed discoverability definition was not before the Court of Appeal nor
contemplated by it in <i>July</i>. While the general discoverability doctrine
set out in <i>July</i> remains unchanged by the <i>Limitations Act</i>
pronouncement, <u>the discoverability definition in the test enunciated by MacKinnon
J. must now be interpreted in accordance with the <i>Limitations Act</i>'s
definition of &quot;discovered&quot;</u>. In this regard, the Court of Appeal's
analysis in <i>Markel</i> and <i>Schmitz</i> cannot be ignored. It is binding
on this court. [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
motion judge held that, although this is not a loss-transfer case or a claim
against the OPCF-44R insurer, the analysis in <em>Markel </em>and <em>Schmitz</em>
applies. In her view, Ms. Rooplal could not be said to know that there is a
loss “caused” by an “omission” of the unidentified motorist insurer, i.e. TTC Insurance,
until she asserted a claim for indemnification against TCC Insurance: see <em>Limitations
Act</em>, ss. 5(1)(a)(i)-(iii). The motion judge concluded that “the limitation
period begins to run … on the first day of default after the demand for
indemnification is made.” Accordingly, Ms. Rooplal’s claim against TTC
Insurance was not statute-barred.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
Ms. Rooplal’s claim against TTC Insurance is statute-barred requires this court
to interpret both the <em>Limitations Act </em>and the <em>Insurance Act</em>’s
unidentified motorist provisions. All parties agree that this is a question of
law, subject to correctness review: <em>Housen v. Nikolaisen,</em> 2002 SCC 33,
[2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 8-9.</p>

<h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Parties’ Positions</h3>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
appellant TTC Insurance’s position is that the motion judge and the Divisional
Court erred in finding that this court’s pre-<em>Limitations Act</em>
jurisprudence no longer governs a claim brought against a s. 265 insurer for
unidentified motorist coverage. TTC Insurance submits that the framework
developed in <em>Markel </em>and <em>Schmitz</em> was not meant to apply to such
claims and both cases are readily distinguishable. Moreover, in TTC Insurance’s
view, “[t]o hold that the limitation period does not commence until the
Plaintiff has made an indemnification demand to the TTC Insurance would produce
an absurd result”, namely that the plaintiff could potentially lie in wait
indefinitely before bringing a claim against the s. 265 insurer.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
other lower court decisions applied the same reasoning as the motion judge and
TTC submits these decisions are wrongly decided: see e.g. <em>Chahine and
Al-Dahak v. Grybas</em>, 2014 ONSC 4698, 38 C.C.L.I. (5th) 282; <em>Platero v.
Pollock</em>, 2015 ONSC 2922, 49 C.C.L.I. (5th) 212; <em>Sukhu v. Bascombe</em>,
2018 ONSC 2878.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
respondent, Ms. Rooplal, submits that the analysis in <em>Markel </em>and <em>Schmitz
</em>applies<em> </em>and no absurdity arises from the motion judge’s decision.
First, this is not a stale claim as TTC Insurance and the TCC are effectively
indistinguishable, sharing the same premises and counsel. Furthermore, s. 6 of
the Schedule contained in Regulation 676 sets out notice requirements for any
claim brought against a s. 265 insurer.</p>

<h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The pre-<em>Limitations Act</em> Jurisprudence</h3>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
the <em>Limitations Act</em>, the courts applied a limitation period contained
in the then-current regulations to the <em>Insurance Act</em>. Section 8(2) of
the relevant schedule held that the limitation period for claims for damages
caused by an unidentified motorist was “two years from the date on which the
cause of action against the insurer arose”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a>
This court found that the plaintiff discovered that “the cause of action arose”
when the material facts on which an action is based were discovered or ought to
have been discovered by the plaintiff’s exercise of reasonable diligence: see <em>July;
Johnson v. Wunderlich </em>(1986), 34 D.L.R. (4th) 120 (Ont. C.A.); <em>Hier v.
Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada</em> (1988), 51 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (Ont. C.A.);
and <em>Chambo v. Musseau</em> (1993), 106 D.L.R. (4th) 757 (Ont. C.A.).</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
<em>July v. Neal</em>, the plaintiff<em> </em>was a passenger in a vehicle
owned and operated by a family member named Neal. Neal’s vehicle was in an
accident involving two other vehicles. The driver of one of those other
vehicles was unidentified. The accident report stated that an unidentified
vehicle was involved in the accident. After the examinations for discovery, counsel
for the plaintiff wrote the plaintiff’s insurer to advise that the plaintiff
would be looking to it for the “loss that may be found to be caused by the hit
and run driver”.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiff brought a claim against Neal within two years of the accident but
waited more than two years to bring a claim for unidentified motorist coverage
against the insurer. MacKinnon, A.C.J.O. observed at pp. 466-7 that in cases
where both an unidentified driver and a third-party identified driver may be at
fault:</p>

<p class=CQuote>I have had great difficulty in interpreting the intended effect
of the relevant legislation and regulation. It seems to me that the drafters of
the legislation were considering the usual case of an insured motorist involved
in an accident with a hit-and-run driver. There is no difficulty in such cases
in requiring the motorist to commence his action within the two-year-time-limit
from the date of the accident. The complicating factor in the instant case … is
the existence of an identified motorist, Neal, who was involved in the accident
and who is a defendant.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
concluded that the limitation period begins to run, “when the material facts on
which the claim is based have been discovered or ought to have been discovered”
and held that it would be up to the trial judge, after hearing the evidence, to
determine when the material facts, including the potential liability of an
unidentified motorist or its insurer, ought to have been discovered. Under the
1% rule, if <u>any</u><em> </em>liability rested with another defendant, the s.
265 insurer would not be required to indemnify the plaintiff.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
that year, in <em>Johnson v. Wunderlich</em> (1986), this court applied a
similar analysis to an uninsured motorist accident. The plaintiffs, Lionel and
David Johnson, were involved in an accident with a vehicle owned by Linda
Wunderlich and operated by Michael Wunderlich. Both Johnsons and Mr. Wunderlich
were killed in the accident and no appearance was entered by the defendants.
The defendants’ motor vehicle was uninsured. The plaintiffs moved to add their
insurer as a party more than two years after the accident. The insurer sought a
declaration that the claim was time-barred.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morden
J.A. (as he then was) rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that the plaintiffs
were simply enforcing the judgment against the tortfeasor in seeking indemnity
from the insurer, such that the limitation period did not begin to run until
all of the conditions precedent for a claim against the insurer had been
satisfied, namely: submission of the notice and proof of claim; determination
of legal liability and the amount of damages; a finding that the plaintiffs
were entitled to damages from the owner or driver of the uninsured automobile; the
judgment remained unsatisfied; and a request for payment from the insurer had
been made and refused. Instead, at pp. 128-129, he held that this was a ‘direct
action’ against the insurer, and that:</p>

<p class=CQuote>[T]he elements of this cause of action are (1) a person insured
(2) who is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or driver of (3)
an uninsured or unidentified automobile. (Implicit in this is that the damages
have resulted from an accident involving the automobile.) The cause of action
accrues when the plaintiff (the person insured) has discovered these material
facts or ought to have discovered them by the exercise of reasonable diligence.
See <i>July v. Neal</i> (1986), 57 O.R. (2d) 218, 44 M.V.R. 1, 19 C.C.L.I. 230,
12 C.P.C. (2d) 303, (Ont. C.A.).</p>

<p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>

<p class=CQuote><a name="crsw_paragraph_num_19_1"></a>[T]he appellants did not
submit that the cause of action does not arise until the insurer has denied
liability on the contract. Notwithstanding that the form of the insurer’s
obligation is contractual (legislatively imposed) I do not read the relevant
provisions as making a denial of liability a constituent element of the direct
claim. In other words, an action commenced before denial of liability would not
be premature from a cause-of-action perspective.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morden
J.A. concluded, however, that “it cannot be determined that an action for
recovery is barred by the terms of s. 8(2) of the Schedule,” because it was
unclear whether the plaintiffs’ action was for declaratory relief or for
recovery against the insurer, and actions for declaratory relief were not
subject to the two-year limitation period in s. 8(2) of the Schedule at that
time. Accordingly, he dismissed the insurer’s argument on the limitation
period.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finlayson
J.A. agreed in the result but would have found that the limitation period had
not expired. At p. 137, he explained:</p>

<p class=CQuote>While the matter is not free from doubt, it is my opinion that an
action against the insurer is an action for breach of contract and the cause of
action arises from the date of the breach. This breach occurs when the insurer
denies liability or the insured knows or ought to know that his claim will not
be honoured.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
case of <em>Hier</em> <em>v. Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada </em>(1988), involved
a two&#8209;party hit-and-run accident. There was no question that the insured
knew on the day of the accident that his vehicle was hit and was entitled to
damages from the unidentified motorist. Goodman J.A. held, at p. 12, that:</p>

<p class=CQuote>In the case at bar the respondent (plaintiff) was insured by
Allstate's policy, he was according to the trial judge, legally entitled to
recover damages from the unidentified automobile, and he was aware on the date
of the accident that the other motor vehicle involved, its owner and operator
were all unidentified. <u>On those facts, it is my opinion, that the limitation
period commenced to run from the date of the accident and the respondent’s
action was barred under s. 8(2)</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=BContinuingPara>All of the necessary elements to establish a “cause of
action” were established and as such, the action against the insurer, brought
more than two years after the accident, was time-barred.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
in <em>Chambo v. Musseau</em> (1993), the plaintiff was injured in an accident
she claimed was caused by another driver who was uninsured. Her claim against
the insurer was brought more than two years after the accident. In that case, Osborne
J.A. allowed the plaintiff’s appeal and order that the action proceed to trial.
In so doing, he distinguished an action against the uninsured motorist from an
action for coverage brought against the insurer. At p. 765, he explained:</p>

<p class=CQuote>[I]t makes no difference whether the insurer and the tortfeasor
are sued in the same action, or whether the insurer alone is named as a
defendant (as happened here). Nor does it matter if, as occurred in <em>Johnson
v. Wunderlich</em>, the insurer is added as a defendant after the commencement
of the action against the tortfeasor. <u>If the uninsured owner/driver and the
insurer are both sued, the cause of action asserted against the tortfeasor is

in negligence; the latter is for payment under a contract, albeit one imposed
by statute. Different limitation periods apply</u>. … The s. 8(2) limitation
period [for a claim against the insurer] is <span lang=EN>two years from the

diligence could have established, that the tortfeasor’s motor vehicle was

sum, prior to the <em>Limitations Act, 2002,</em> the two-year limitation
period for a claim for indemnification was triggered when the person knew or
ought to have known the material facts giving rise to the cause of action,
namely: (1) the plaintiff was injured and (2) was legally entitled to recover
damages from the owner or driver of (3) an uninsured or unidentified
automobile. It was recognized that determining when the cause of action arose on
a claim for indemnification was more difficult where there were multiple
possible tortfeasors one of whom was unidentified or uninsured. The claim
against the insurer is a claim founded in the insurance contract imposed by
statute, not a tort action, and dependant on the plaintiff knowing or with
reasonable diligence being able to establish that no other tortfeasor is even
1% liable. As such, (except in <em>Hier</em>, where the insured knew on the day
of the accident that he was entitled to damages only from the unidentified
motorist and therefore a claim could be brought against the insurer), the appellate
cases from this court found that the commencement of the limitation period was a
factual matter to be resolved by the trial judge.</p>

<em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> supersedes the limitation period set out in s.
8(2) of the Schedule contained in Regulation 676: see <em>Limitations Act</em>,
s. 19(1). The two-year limitation period set out in s. 4 of the <em>Limitations

wording is when the “claim [is] discovered.”</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
5 of <em>Act </em>determines when a claim is discovered. It provides that a
claim is discovered when the plaintiff knows or ought to have known (i) that
they have suffered injury or loss (ii) by an act or omission that is (iii)
“that of the person against whom the claim is made” and (iv) it is appropriate
to commence a legal proceeding.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
particular note is the requirement of s. 5(1)(a)(iii): the claim discovered only
when a plaintiff learns that their injury was caused by the acts or omissions <u>of
the person against whom the claim is made</u>. In other contexts, this court
has held it is an error to overlook this particular requirement imposed by s.
5(a)(iii): see <em>Morrison v. Barzo</em>, 2018 ONCA 979, 144 O.R. (3d) 600, at
paras. 35, 47.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Markel
</em>concerned two collisions, both of which involved an automobile and a
tractor-trailer. In both cases, the insureds’ right to insurance benefits was
not in issue. The dispute was which insurer was responsible for payment of the
benefits to the insured under s. 275 of the <em>Insurance Act</em>.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a>
The plaintiff drivers’ insurers asked the tractor-trailers’ insurers to
indemnify them for some of the payments made to the insured. The tractor-trailer
insurers did not make the payments requested. Both tractor-trailer insurers
claimed that the limitation period for the loss-transfer claims had passed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharpe
J.A. reviewed the discoverability requirements of the <em>Limitations Act</em>.
He noted that the new limitations regime required him to focus his analysis on
the four elements of s. 5(1)(a). At para. 24, he observed:</p>

<p class=CQuote>Items (ii) and (iii) require that the second party insurer must
have done or omitted to do something that can be said to have caused a loss.
The second party insurer cannot be said to have omitted to indemnify if there
was no request for indemnification. It follows that items (ii) and (iii) cannot
be satisfied until the first party insurer has asserted the loss transfer claim
against the second party insurer to trigger a legally enforceable claim or
obligation.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
this in mind, he reasoned that, once the request for indemnification has been
sent, “[a]ll the facts are present to trigger the legal obligation of the part
of the second party insurer to indemnify the first party insurer for the loss.
The situation has crystallized into a complete and valid legal claim that is
immediately enforceable against the second party insurer.” According, he held,
at para. 27, that the first-party insurer ‘discovers’ the loss caused by the
second-party insurer “the moment the second party insurer can be said to have
failed to satisfy its legal obligation to satisfy the loss transfer claim … [which
is] the day after the Request for Indemnification is made.”</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the party demanding indemnification did not know it had a loss
resulting from the second insurer’s wrongdoing and that it was appropriate to
commence a proceeding until a demand for indemnification was made that was not
satisfied by the insurer. Until then, the claim was not “discovered” within the
meaning of the <em>Limitations Act</em>.</p>

involved a claim for indemnity for underinsured motorist coverage pursuant to
an optional OPCF-44R endorsement. The plaintiff brought a claim against the
underinsured tortfeasor in a timely manner but did not bring a claim against
the OPCF-44R insurer for excess damages until nearly four years after the
accident. On appeal, the OPCF-44R insurer argued that two-year limitation
period under s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act</em> began to run at the time the
plaintiff knew or ought to know that their claim against the uninsured
tortfeasor exceeded the limitations of the tortfeasor’s coverage.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
court rejected the insurer’s argument, holding that “this court’s recent
decision in <em>Markel </em>is dispositive of the issue of when the s. 5
limitation period begins to run in respect of a claim under the OPCF 44R.” The
court did not accept that this would result in prejudice to the insurer,
observing that “[t]here are a number of ways in which underinsurers can protect
their interests including … a provision requiring the insured to provide timely
notice to the insurer when he knew or ought to have known he was underinsured.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TTC
Insurance asks this court to distinguish <em>Markel </em>and <em>Schmitz. </em>Notwithstanding
the language in s. 5 of the <em>Limitations Act</em>, they argue that Ms.&nbsp;Rooplal
discovered her claim against TTC Insurance when she learned of the involvement
of an unidentified driver who was potentially liable for her injuries.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TCC
Insurance urges that <em>Markel </em>and <em>Schmitz </em>“are appropriate for
their own unique contextual circumstances” but inapt for claims against s. 265
insurers. TTC Insurance points out that this case is different from <em>Markel</em>
as there the only issue to be determined was which of two insurers was
responsible for the payment. Similarly, <em>Schmitz</em> concerned a
contractual dispute between insured and insurer, not the statutory provisions
in s. 265, so the contract-based framework articulated in <em>Markel </em>was
arguably more appropriately adopted there than in this case.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
<em>July</em> and this case, by contrast, tort liability had not been
determined among the defendants and the s. 265 insurer’s liability depended on
a finding that no other party was even 1% liable. In <em>July</em>, this court
held that discovery of the cause of action could only be decided by the trial
judge after hearing evidence.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
5 of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> was enacted to bring greater clarity
and certainty to the determination of when a limitation period commences, as
described in the recommendations of <span style='line-height:202%;color:black'>Limitations
Act Consultation Group</span>: see <em>Recommendations for a New Limitations
Act</em> (Toronto: Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario, 1991). Unless
the <em>Limitations Act </em>provides otherwise, a <span style='color:black;

claim is discovered”, that is, </span>when the plaintiff knows, or ought to
have known they have suffered loss, injury or damage caused by or contributed

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
importance of isolating the wrongful act of each particular defendant has been
emphasized by this court. It is not enough that the plaintiff has suffered some
loss from some act or omission. As Strathy C.J.O. explained in <em>Apotex</em>,
at para. 86, discovery requires that the person with the claim “know that the ‘injury,
loss or damage had <u>occurred</u>’ (s. 5(1)(a)(i)), that it was <u>caused or
contributed</u> to by the act or omission (the breach of contract) (s.
5(i)(a)(ii)), and that the act or omission was <u>that of the defendant</u> (s.
5(1)(a)(iii))” (emphasis in original).</p>

Rooplal’s proposed Amended Statement of Claim asserts a claim in negligence
against the unidentified motorist, the TTC, and the TTC driver; and a claim for
declaratory relief and indemnity in contract against TTC Insurance for damages
resulting from the actions of the unidentified motorist up to the s. 265 policy
limit.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
is a distinction to be drawn between knowledge of the act or omission of the
unidentified motorist, for which (but for practical impediments) damages in
tort may be sought, and the act or omission of the insurer for which
indemnification pursuant to the insurance policy is sought. TTC Insurance
suggests that this court should ignore this distinction as, in effect, “the
insurer stands in the shoes of the uninsured or unidentified tortfeasor” in a
claim brought under s. 265 of the <em>Insurance Act</em>: quoting <em>Kosanovic
v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co.</em> (2004), 237 D.L.R. (4th) 441 (Ont. C.A.),
at para. 7. TTC Insurance also directs this court’s attention to several other post-<em>Limitations
Act, 2002</em> decisions from the lower courts, which have applied the <em>July</em>
discovery rules to unidentified motorist cases: see <em>Galego v. Pereira</em>
(2005), 207 O.A.C. 384 (Div. Ct.); <em>Bhatt v. Doe</em>, 2018 ONSC 950; <em>Wilkinson

her claim against TTC Insurance when she knows or ought to know that <u>TTC
Insurance</u> did or omitted to do something that caused her loss or damage. Only
then is her claim “discovered” such that the two-year limitation period under
s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act</em> begins to run. The requirements of s.
5(1)(a) are conjunctive: <em>Longo</em> at para. 41. In this case, there is no
evidence Ms. Rooplal has made any demand for indemnification.</p>

concern limitation periods and the quoted language was only a shorthand summary
of the s. 265 scheme. Nor does <em>Galego</em> address the <em>Limitations Act</em>.
<em>Bhatt </em>and <em>Wilkinson </em>do not address the s. 5 criteria for

modern principle of statutory interpretation provides that “the words of an Act

discovered when plaintiff knows, or ought to have known, that the act or
omission causing the plaintiff’s loss “was that of the person <u>against whom

exceptions to the s. 5 discovery rules other than those identified by the Act. Indeed,
some provisions in the <em>Insurance Act</em> are specifically excluded from
the <em>Limitations Act</em>’s ambit: see <em>Limitations Act</em>, s. 19(1)

Insurance claims the requirements of s. 5 of the <em>Limitations Act</em> may,
at first glance, appear to create a seemingly undesirable outcome: The
plaintiff could control the limitation period by delaying her demand to
indemnify. Further, as noted above, the insurer need only indemnify the
plaintiff if no other party is even 1% liable. TTC Insurance asserts that, if
the limitation period on the plaintiff’s claim against the s. 265 insurer does
not begin to run until the plaintiff demands indemnification, the plaintiff can
delay bringing the claim against the insurer until after the tort action
against other potentially liable parties has been determined. This could result
in a multiplicity of proceedings, as TTC Insurance is permitted to defend
liability on the request for indemnification under Regulation 676: Schedule, s.
4(1)(c).</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
the consequences of the limitation analysis must be considered harmoniously
with the scheme of the <em>Insurance Act</em> as a whole. In this case, the requirements
set out in s. 8(1) of the Schedule contained in Regulation 676 provide that:</p>

<p class=CQuote>No person is entitled to bring an action to recover an amount
provided for under the contract, as required by subsection 265 (1) of the [<em>Insurance
Act</em>] unless the requirements of this Schedule with respect to the claim
have been complied with.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
or not a party chooses to commence a claim against the insurer, insurers must
be provided with knowledge of the underlying accident, as Regulation 676 and
the Schedule are terms and conditions of the contract of insurance. Among other
things, the Schedule requires a potential claimant for unidentified motorist
coverage to provide the purported s. 265 insurer with: (a) a statement setting
out the details of the accident including whether it was caused by an
unidentified motorist and what damages were suffered within 30 days or as soon
as practicable (s. 3); (b) written notice of the claim against the insurer and
the circumstances thereof within 30 days or as soon as practicable (s. 6).</p>

as a whole, therefore, the statutory scheme provides some safeguards against
the threats identified by TTC Insurance. As Hoegg J.A. for the Newfoundland and

No. 250, at paras. 22-23, an insurer faced with a potential unidentified
motorist claim may begin the limitation period by refusing to indemnify a s.
