  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 17, 2014, the appellant was convicted
    by a jury of sexual assault, sexual interference and invitation to sexual
    touching of the complainant, who was a young boy at the time of the alleged events
    between 1988 and 1993. The appellant was sentenced to three and a half years less
    six months’ credit for his strict bail conditions, and had various ancillary
    orders issued against him, including lifetime orders under ss. 161(1)(a) and
    (b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 185, c. C-46, which prohibited him
    from attending public parks or public swimming areas where persons under the
    age of 16 are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, daycare
    centres, school grounds, playgrounds or community centres, and from obtaining
    employment or becoming a volunteer where he would be in a position of trust or
    authority over persons under the age of 16.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals both his convictions and
    his sentence. The conviction appeal is based on two grounds: (1) an alleged
    error by the trial judge in the <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em><i>, </i>[1991] 1 S.C.R.
    742, jury instruction, and (2) a request to admit fresh evidence, which supports
    the appellant’s partial alibi that he did not reside with the complainant for
    the entire period of the alleged offences. With respect to the sentence appeal,
    the appellant was granted leave to appeal the s. 161 orders as unconstitutional,
    although the issue was not raised at trial. Section 161 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> was enacted in 1993. The appellant submits that the retroactive application of
    ss. 161(1)(a) and (b) contravene s. 11(i) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights
    and Freedoms</em> and cannot be saved by s.1. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified that he met the
    appellant when he was 5 years old and the appellant was about 20 years old.
    They lived in the same house on Grafton Street, with the complainant’s family
    renting the apartment on the main floor and the appellant renting the apartment
    in the basement. The complainant and the appellant often played together in the
    appellant’s apartment. The complainant indicated that they stayed in touch when
    his family relocated to King Street approximately a year later. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before Christmas in 1987, the complainant’s
    mother moved with him and his older sister to an apartment in Scarborough on
    Mornelle Court. The appellant helped them move and ended up staying. The
    complainant testified that he initially thought the appellant would stay for a
    few weeks, but he ended up staying for a few years. The appellant slept on the
    floor in the complainant’s bedroom.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant claimed that the sexual contact
    began a few months after the appellant moved in. It involved mutual
    masturbation and oral sex several nights a week. The appellant told the
    complainant that what they were doing was normal, that he was his number one
    bud, and that their relationship should be kept a secret. At trial, the
    complainant recalled two specific incidents: on one occasion, the appellant
    took a picture of his penis, saying he was sending it to his girlfriend because
    she liked small penises; and on a second occasion, the appellant attempted anal
    intercourse, which the complainant resisted because he was uncomfortable. The
    appellant then simulated anal sex by thrusting his penis in and out between the
    complainant’s legs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant said that all sexual contact
    took place when they were alone in his bedroom with the door closed. He also
    said that his mother was not checking on him regularly because she was an
    alcoholic at the time. His mother confirmed that the appellant stayed with them
    for a couple of years, but she claimed that she checked on the complainant multiple
    times a week and insisted that his bedroom door remain open.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After the appellant left the complainant’s
    apartment, he moved in with another family in the same building who also had a
    young boy. The complainant testified that he was a friend of the young boy, would
    frequently sleep over there and continued to see the appellant. The complainant
    disclosed that one time, when he was sleeping over at his friend’s house, he
    woke up and found the appellant fondling him. He recalled telling his friend,
    but his friend did not remember the incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the complainant, after the
    appellant moved to Kingston, Ontario, they kept in touch by phone and by
    letters which the appellant sent to the complainant’s friend in the building to
    pass on to the complainant. In the letters, the appellant told the complainant
    that he loved him and missed him. The friend recalled some calls, but not the
    letters. The complainant’s older brother recalled finding a letter, as the
    complainant said, but did not remember if it was signed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant said that when the appellant
    moved back to Toronto, he would visit the appellant at his apartment. When the
    complainant was asked whether he had any further sexual contact with the
    appellant, he only reported an occasion when the appellant made a video of him playing
    with himself that he could use to attract a girl. The complainant testified
    that they later burned the video.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified in his defence and
    described the timeline of his living arrangements during the relevant period. His
    account was that he moved out of the Grafton triplex in January 1986 (before
    the complainant’s family did) and lived with various friends until June 1987,
    when he moved to Edmonton to join his girlfriend, R.P. She returned to Ontario
    in September 1987, and he returned two months later. He initially moved in with
    R.P. in Barrie. He then lived with another woman in Barrie from December 1987
    until March or April 1988 when he moved back with R.P.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant said that he did not help the

    contact with them while he was in Edmonton. However, he visited them when he

    friend (and the girlfriend of the appellant’s friend) at Mornelle Court in the
    summer of 1988 and stayed there for six to eight months, at which time he had
    daily interaction with the complainant and his family. He agreed that the

    complainant’s family from the end of 1990 until April 1991, a period of
    approximately three to four months. At that time, he did sleep on the floor in
    the complainant’s room, but denied any sexual contact with the complainant. He
    also said that the bedroom door was open and that at night, the complainant’s

    stealing tools from the complainant’s uncle. That is when he moved to Kingston.

    were alleged to have been committed. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>2. You do not decide whether something
    happened by simply comparing one version of events with another, and choosing
    between them. You have to consider all the evidence and decide whether you have
    been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the events that form the basis of
    the crimes charged in fact took place. </span></p>

    as finders of fact to assess the evidence in coming to your decision. </span></p>

    appellant] was elsewhere during the period of times when the offences were
    allegedly committed and you believe his evidence that he did not commit these
    offences during the discrete periods of time he admits to living at the
    [complainant’s friend’s] and [the complainant’s] homes, you must find [the

    you beyond a reasonable doubt that [the appellant] committed the offence

    of the reasonable doubt component in her recharge to the jury, the appellant
    alleges that the original charge contained an additional error in the <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction. Specifically, the trial judge used the conjunctive “and” between
    the phrases: “[i]f you do not believe the evidence that [the appellant] was
    elsewhere during the period of time when the offences were allegedly committed” <u>and</u> “you do not believe his evidence that he did not commit these
    offences during the discrete periods of time he admits to living at the […]
    homes”. In so doing, the appellant argues, the trial judge effectively
    instructed the jury that in order to acquit him, they had to have a reasonable
    doubt about both the “partial alibi” defence and the appellant’s blanket denial
    of the offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown acknowledges that the trial judge’s
    formulation of the <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction was not ideal, but submits that
    there was no possibility that the alleged error could have affected the jury’s
    verdict. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By treating the two elements of the appellant’s
    defence conjunctively, the issue for this court is whether the jury understood from
    the trial judge’s instruction that they must acquit if any of the defence
    evidence raised a reasonable doubt about his guilt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the Crown that this instruction was
    not ideal because the first two prongs of the <em>W.(D.)</em> test should have
    been formulated in a way that did not separate the defences, but focused the
    jury on whether the evidence that favoured the defence raised a reasonable
    doubt about his guilt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, in this particular case, a reasonable
    doubt about the appellant’s timeline of his whereabouts, and whether he had the
    opportunity to commit the offences throughout the whole multi-year period
    alleged by the complainant would not have led to an acquittal on its own,
    because there was at least a four to six week period when the appellant
    admitted he slept in the same room as the complainant, i.e. he had the
    opportunity to commit the offences. For that period, the jury would have to
    decide if the appellant’s evidence or other evidence in support of his version
    of events raised a reasonable doubt. If not, they had to consider whether, based
    on all of the evidence, including the evidence of the complainant, they were satisfied
    of the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that if the jury had a
    reasonable doubt raised by the timeline of his whereabouts and his
    corresponding partial alibi, then that doubt could have undermined the credibility
    and reliability of the complainant, and therefore resulted in an acquittal. He argues
    that even though the trial judge properly instructed the jury about the third
    prong of the <em>W.(D.)</em> framework and told them to assess the evidence as
    a whole, this did not negate the error from the first two prongs in which the
    trial judge conflated the two aspects of the defence evidence and failed to provide
    the jury with a proper route to acquittal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While it is true that the jury was told to
    assess the evidence as a whole, so they could consider the complainant’s
    evidence when deciding whether the appellant’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt,
    the <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction asked them to focus on the defence evidence,
    and if it raised a reasonable doubt, to acquit the accused. In this case, the appellant’s
    evidence on the timeline of his whereabouts and his partial alibi, taken on its
    own, would not lead to an acquittal because of the lack of alibi for the four
    to six week period that he admitted to staying with the complainant. However, if
    the appellant’s evidence of his alibi left the jury with a reasonable doubt because
    it led them to question the complainant’s evidence overall, they could have
    acquitted on that basis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, that possibility was made clear by
    the third prong of the trial judge’s <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction, where the
    jury was told that they could not convict unless they were satisfied of the
    appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on all the evidence. It was
    clear that to convict, they had to believe the complainant that what he said did
    actually occur during the time period covered by the indictment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits that, taken as a whole, the
    charge made it clear to the jury that they could only convict if they were
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant committed the offences. This
    point was reinforced in the closing submissions of both trial counsel. Furthermore,
    the jury was instructed at the beginning of the <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction
    that they had to consider all of the evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown also relies on trial counsel’s
    agreement with the wording of the <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction as an indication
    that its meaning was clear to all the participants and would not have confused
    the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I accept the submission of the Crown. It was
    clear to the jury that the alibi defence did not cover the whole period of time
    outlined in the indictment, and that the appellant admitted to living with the
    complainant’s family and sleeping on the floor of the complainant’s bedroom for
    either four to six weeks or three to four months, beginning in late 1990. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, as part of the charge, the trial
    judge summarized the evidence on the different timelines, as provided by the
    appellant, his girlfriend, and other witnesses, and left the jury with the task
    of deciding what to make of the inconsistencies and the 20-year passage of time
    since the events. At the end of the section on alibi, which came immediately
    before the positions of the parties in the jury charge, the trial judge told
    the jury:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>20. In the end, you have the task of deciding
    whether you are left with a reasonable doubt that [the appellant] was somewhere
    else and not at […] Mornelle Crt. at the relevant time that the offences
    alleged occurred. There is no magical formula to arrive at a decision. You must
    use your experience and common sense.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>21. Crown counsel has the burden to prove
    beyond a reasonable doubt that [the appellant] was at […] Mornelle Crt. at the [complainant’s]
    apartment during the period set out in the indictment sometime between January
    1, 1988 and October 10, 1993, and committed the acts of sexual interference,
    invitation to sexual touching and sexual assaults against [the complainant].</span></p>

    These records state that the appellant received income support benefits in
    Alberta from July to November 1988, and show that his family was involved with
    Child Intervention Services in Alberta between August and October 1988. This
    evidence would corroborate that the appellant was in Edmonton, Alberta between
    July and November 1988 and could not have committed the offences then, as
    alleged by the complainant. It would, he submits, have supported his
    credibility and undermined the credibility of the complainant at trial.</span></p>

    part of his follow-up on the fresh evidence application. Although the appellant
    testified that he did not obtain an Ontario driver’s license until 1996 or 1998,
    the evidence is a driver’s license history which reflects address information
    the appellant gave to police officers when he was pulled over while driving
    between 1981 and 2009. This evidence indicates that on December 14, 1989, he
    reported his address to be on Lawrence Avenue East in Scarborough; on August
    21, 1990 and again on August 20, 1992, he reported his address to be on Mornelle
    Court (specifically, the complainant’s apartment). In March 1992, he reported
    his address to be on Russell Street in Kingston, Ontario. In his testimony for
    the fresh evidence application, the appellant explained that he did not live

    and November 1988, and would have undermined the credibility of the complainant,
    who took the position that the appellant lived with his family for a number of consecutive
    years after Christmas 1987.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I again accept the Crown’s position. With
    respect to the ability of the fresh evidence to have enhanced the appellant’s
    credibility at trial, the Crown submits that the fresh evidence would instead have
    undermined the appellant’s credibility, because it contradicts some of his
    trial testimony, demonstrates that his timelines are unreliable, shows that he
    is willing to lie to protect himself, and reveals that he guessed some dates
    and coordinated his evidence with that of his girlfriend, R.P.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Two examples of inconsistencies between the
    fresh evidence and the appellant’s trial testimony demonstrate the Crown’s
    point. First, with respect to when the appellant lived at the complainant’s
    apartment on Mornelle Court, a very significant issue, he says the MTO record
    is correct and he was there from August to October 1990. This is inconsistent
    with his trial evidence, which indicates that he stayed with the complainant’s
    family for four to six weeks, or three to four months, from late 1990 onward. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, at trial, the appellant contradicted
    himself about when he was in Edmonton, 1987 or 1988. In his testimony on the
    fresh evidence application, the appellant acknowledged that when the
    contradiction was put to him by the trial Crown in cross-examination, he defended
    himself by denying something he knew was true.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The probative value of the MTO record is also undercut
    by the fact that it essentially consists of a series of self-reports made by
    the appellant of his current address at the specific times he was stopped by
    police while driving without a license. In other words, because its value depends
    on his credibility, it is difficult to see how it can enhance that credibility
    by providing further discrepancies. On the cross-examination on his affidavit,
    the appellant himself took the position that some of the MTO entries were
    correct and some were not.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the Edmonton records, while they
    provide some support for the assertion that the appellant was in Alberta from
    July to November 1988, they do not prove his residency in the province, or that
    he did not come and go. For example, R.P. testified that she came back to
    Ontario in September 1988, when the family investigations by the Alberta
    authorities would still have been ongoing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>More significantly, I note the trial Crown took
    the position with the jury that the case did not turn on how long the appellant
    was in Edmonton during the period of the alleged offences. In his closing address,
    he told the jury that despite evidence from an Alberta family agency indicating
    that the appellant was in Edmonton on August 29, 1988, not much turned on this
    fact because it was not clear how long he was there and because the
    complainant’s mother had testified about times when the appellant had disappeared
    during the period he was staying with them. In addition, defence counsel at
    trial also minimized the significance of the 1987/1988 discrepancy in the
    appellant’s testimony about when he was in Edmonton, when he told the jury in
    his closing address that the appellant was confused about the dates. He stated that
    such confusion was not unusual because all the witnesses, except R.P., were
    inconsistent with the timeline, and emphasized to the jury that the alleged
    offences occurred many years ago.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, taking the fresh evidence at its
    highest, while it had the potential to enhance the appellant’s partial alibi,
    it did not undermine the critical fact that the appellant acknowledged his
    residence with the complainant’s family for a significant period of time. He
    therefore had the opportunity to commit the offences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The key to the case was whether the jury was
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual offences occurred when the
    opportunity existed. That turned on the credibility of the complainant and of the
    appellant. Whether the fresh evidence would have enhanced the appellant’s
    credibility or undermined the complainant’s credibility is purely speculative.
    There was already considerable testimony about the relevant dates, and the
    fresh evidence would not have added anything definitive.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Prior to 1993, a person who had been convicted
    of any of a number of sexual offences against children would be automatically
    guilty of the offence of vagrancy if they were found near a school, park, or
    other area where children could be. The vagrancy provision, ss. 179(1)(b), was
    struck down under s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em> as overly broad in the case of <em>R.
    v. Heywood</em> (1992), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 502 (BCCA), and subsequently confirmed
    by the Supreme Court of Canada, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 761. In order to fill the legislative
    gap and to give judges the power to impose restrictive orders protecting children
    from convicted sexual predators, in 1993, Parliament very quickly enacted ss.
    161(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which read as follows when enacted:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>161. (1) – Order of prohibition</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Where an offender is convicted, or is

    of an offence under section 151, 152, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or (3) or
    section 170, 171, 271, 272 or 273, in respect of a person who is under the age
    of fourteen years, the court that sentences the offender or directs that the
    accused be discharged, as the case may be, in addition to any other punishment
    that may be imposed for that offence or any other condition prescribed in the

    did not make the provision apply retroactively to offences committed before it
    came into force in 1993. As a result, in a number of cases after 1993 where an
    order was sought under ss. 161(1) for an offence that had been committed before
    1993, courts declined to apply the provision. In <em>R. v. Hudson</em>, [1997]
    O.J. No. 5151 (C.A.), for example, McMurtry C.J.O. stated, at para. 1, that
    “the s. 161 order was illegal as s. 161 cannot operate retroactively.” See also <em>R. v. Jewell</em><i>; <em>R. v. Gramlick</em> </i>(1995), 100 C.C.C. (3d)

    Internet or other digital networks. Both subsections (the “2012 amendments”) were
    seen to be part of Parliament’s attempt to provide sentencing judges with an
    expanded scope for the issuance of prohibition orders against sexual offenders.
    However, since K.R.J. committed his offences before the 2012 amendments
    (2008-2011), the question brought before the Supreme Court was whether these

    concluded that both ss. 161(1)(c) and (d) infringed upon an appellant’s s.
    11(i) <em>Charter</em> right. While ss. (d) could be saved by s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>,

    person under 16 years old. Karakatsanis J. recognized this as a “substantial
    intrusion” on the liberty and security of an offender. She found that the retroactive
    application of ss. 161(1)(c) would have a significant deleterious effect on the
    offender, and lead to broader societal harms by punishing people without prior
    notice, “undermin[ing] fairness in criminal proceedings and compromise[ing] the
    rule of law”, all of which are “core tenets of our justice system”: at para.
    82.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown sought to justify the retroactive
    application of ss. 161(1)(c) on the basis that more children would be protected
    from recidivist offenders, and led evidence of the rates of recidivism among
    sexual offenders against children. However, the Crown’s evidence did not
    demonstrate how the added prohibition in ss. 161(1)(c) would actually enhance
    the protection provided by orders under ss. (a) and (b). As Karakatsanis J. wrote,
    at para. 89, “[i]t was therefore unclear what effect the retrospective
    operation of ss. 161(1)(c) would have on the recidivism rates identified by the
    Crown.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Most important to the Supreme Court was the fact
    that there was no temporal justification for the enactment of ss. (c). When ss.
    161(1)(c) was enacted, Parliament was not responding to an emerging threat or
    to an evolving social context: at para. 83. In terms of sexual offences
    resulting from physical proximity, nothing had changed in 2012 with respect to
    the nature or degree of risk faced by children since the last time ss. 161(1)
    was amended. Karakatsanis J. found, at para. 83, that: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The dearth of a compelling temporal
    justification for imposing s. 161(1)(c) retrospectively enhances the damage the
    provision does to fairness and the rule of law, and thus undermines public
    confidence in the criminal justice system.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As an example, Karakatsanis J. pointed to the Crown’s
    record, which suggested that many sexual assaults against children are
    perpetrated by family members or acquaintances, and responded, at para. 92,
    that “surely this reality did not just recently come to Parliament’s
    attention.” Karakatsanis J. concluded that the Crown had not presented a
    “temporal justification” for the retrospective limitation on an offender’s
    rights and liberties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At para. 93, Karakatsanis J. set out the
    rationale for rejecting the retrospective operation of ss. (c) on the basis
    that its deleterious effects outweighed the beneficial ones, even in the
    context of the need to protect children:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Temporal considerations are relevant in this
    context because, at its root, s. 11(i) is about the <i>timing </i>of changes to
    penal laws. In this case, it is not Parliament’s decision to increase
    punishment for sexual offenders that has, by itself, triggered <i>Charter</i> scrutiny – rather, it is Parliament’s decision to reach back in time to impose
    these enhanced prohibitions on offenders who had no notice of them that offends
    s. 11(i). Thus, temporal factors that may help explain Parliament’s rationale
    for circumventing a basic tenet of our criminal law are relevant to the s.
    11(i) inquiry. When it comes to s. 11(i), timing can be everything. [Emphasis
    in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Karakatsanis J. then turned to ss. 161(1)(d),
    and found that, similar to ss.161(1)(c), there are significant deleterious
    effects associated with the retrospective application of a complete ban on Internet
    use, especially in comparison to the previous prohibition in former s. 161(c), which
    was on Internet communication with children. This constituted a significant deprivation
    of an offender’s liberty, given the ubiquitous presence of the Internet in our
    everyday personal, social and economic life. As with ss. 161(1)(c), the
    imposition of such a punishment without prior notice compromised the fairness
    of the criminal proceedings and challenged the rule of law, going to the core
    of the purpose of s. 11(i).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, unlike for ss. (c), Karakatsanis J. found,
    at para. 101, that the record presented by the Crown demonstrated a temporal
    justification for the need to apply ss. 161(1)(d) retrospectively, because:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Subsection] 161(1)(d) is directed at grave,
    emerging harms precipitated by a rapidly evolving social and technological
    context. This evolving context has changed both the <i>degree</i> and <i>nature</i> of the risk of sexual violence facing young persons. As a result, the previous
    iteration of s. 161 became insufficient to respond to the modern risks children
    face. By closing this legislative gap and mitigating these new risks, the
    benefits of the retrospective operation of s. 161(1)(d) are significant and
    fairly concrete. [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Karakatsanis J. focused on evidence of the proliferation
    of social media and its use by sexual predators to communicate with children
    and to publish photographs, creating “[n]ew and qualitatively different
    opportunities to harm young people”: at para. 107.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By specifically addressing the acceleration of advances
    in Internet technology and consequent behaviours, Karakatsanis J. concluded, at
    para. 110, that Parliament was filling a “legislative gap” that both enhanced
    the salutary effects of the section and also mitigated its deleterious effects:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>From the perspective of public confidence in
    the criminal justice system, the retrospective operation of a law that was
    enacted to respond to a swiftly changing social context and emerging threats
    seems less unfair and less inconsistent with the rule of law than the
    retrospective operation of a law that was not enacted for a compelling temporal
    reason.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following this analysis, Karakatsanis J. held that
    Parliament had a compelling temporal justification for giving ss. 161(1)(d)
    retrospective effect. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Karakatsanis J. subsequently weighed the
    deleterious effects of retrospectivity against other factors that tipped in
    favour of finding that the provision was saved by s. 1: the harms at stake (i.e.
    sexual offending against young people) are powerful; the statutory regime for
    imposing s. 161 orders is highly tailored and discretionary; an Internet
    prohibition, while invasive, is not among the most onerous of punishments; and new
    risks from the rapidly evolving Internet technology make the salutary effects
    of ss. 161(1)(d) more concrete and mitigate the adverse impact of the law on
    fairness.</span></p>

    that ss. 161(1)(a) and (b) constitute a punishment and contravene s. 11(i) of

    met its burden that the <em>Charter</em> infringement is justified under s. 1,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Turning to s. 1 and the <em>Oakes</em> factors, the
    retroactive application of ss. (a) and (b) is rationally connected to the
    purpose of the section, i.e. to protect children from recidivist sexual
    offenders, and minimally impairs the rights of offenders. The latter conclusion
    on minimal impairment has two bases, as in <em>K.R.J.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at para. 76: (1) the orders allowed
    under s. 161 are discretionary and tailored to the offender, and (2) a
    prospective-only application of the provisions would compromise the full
    objective of Parliament to protect children from recidivist offenders. In that
    regard, I note that the offences perpetrated by such offenders can go
    undetected for many years, as occurred with the appellant in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, I would not give effect to the Crown’s
    argument that the deleterious effects of retroactively applying ss. (a) and (b)
    are mitigated by the fact that when the appellant committed the offences in
    question, the vagrancy law (ss. 179(1)(b)) was in effect and gave him notice,
    at least of the restrictions related to ss. (a), i.e. attending at places where
    children could be, such as parks, school playgrounds and swimming pools. That
    law was declared unconstitutional. An unconstitutional law is invalid. No cases
    were cited in support of the proposition that an invalid law can provide an
    accused with notice of a potential sentence to be handed down after its
    declaration of invalidity. In addition, the vagrancy law did not prohibit the
    conduct covered in ss. (b) regarding employment and volunteer activities that
    involve children. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a result, the deleterious effects of ss. (a)
    and (b) are similar to those described by the Supreme Court in respect of ss.
    (c) and (d). The retroactive application of the provisions compromises fairness
    in criminal proceedings and the rule of law. In other words, they undermine the
    core purpose of s. 11(i) of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The salutary effect of ss. (a) and (b) is the
    protection of children from recidivist sexual predators by limiting the
    opportunities for such offenders to have physical access to children both in
    public places and in private employment and volunteer settings. The common-sense
    proposition that limiting the opportunity to have contact with children will
    limit the opportunity to offend is supported by the evidence of Dr. Ramshaw,
    which was filed by the Crown on appeal. The salutary effect is clearly
    significant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fact that as recently as 2018, there were 41
    convictions in the Ontario Court of Justice for pre-1993 sexual offences, in 13
    of which s. 161 orders were made, and 24 such convictions in the Superior Court
    (with no available information on the number of s. 161 orders), demonstrates
    that even 28 years later, there is still a purpose for the retroactive
    application of the law.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

lang=EN-CA>From the legislative record provided by the Crown, there is no
    explanation for why Parliament did not make these provisions retroactive when it
    enacted s. 161 in 1993, after the vagrancy law was struck down. One could
    speculate that it was an oversight, given that all offences committed before 1993
    and the offenders who committed them would not be subject to this important law
    enacted with urgency. However, if it was an oversight, it was not addressed by
    Parliament until 2003 and was only corrected with the enactment of the
    revisions to s. 161 in 2005. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Supreme Court’s direction from <em>K.R.J.</em> is that for the salutary
    effects of the retrospective application of a sentencing law that contravenes
    s. 11(i) to outweigh its deleterious effects, there must be a temporal
    justification for its enactment at the time it was made retroactive, and
    Parliament must be filling a legislative gap created by a development in
    society or in the application of the law as it existed, which Parliament could
    not have anticipated before that time. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Although not necessary to decide, for the purpose of the analysis, I
    would suggest that had Parliament made s. 161 retroactive on enactment in 1993,
    it would have been filling a legislative gap that it could not have anticipated,
    that was created when the vagrancy law was struck down, and that would have
    constituted the required temporal justification for making the law apply
    retrospectively.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>However, Parliament allowed 12 years to go by before addressing the
    situation, during which time, as discussed above, a number of courts that were
    asked to apply the section retroactively refused to do so. Further, the record
    provided by the Crown on this appeal that includes the Hansard references to
    the introduction, discussion and ultimate approval of the revisions in 2005,
    does not disclose any temporal justification for making the provisions
    retroactive at that time. Adopting Karakatsanis J.’s comment in <em>K.R.J.</em>,
    the fact that sexual predators of children have a high rate of recidivism is
    not new information. Addressing that very issue was the purpose of the former
    vagrancy provision and of s. 161.</span></p>

    and (b), enacted in 2005, cannot meet the temporal justification criterion
    because it did not fill a legislative gap at that time that Parliament could
    not have anticipated in 1993. Without the temporal justification, the salutary
    effects of retroactive application to pre-1993 offences and offenders, although
    very important, cannot outweigh the deleterious effects on those offenders,
    including the appellant. As a result, the retrospective application of ss.
    161(1)(a) and (b) to offences committed before their enactment in 1993, is not
    saved by s. 1 of the Charter.</span></p>
