  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the early morning hours of March 26, 2016,
    the police stopped the respondent, Walker McColman, for the purpose of
    determining whether he was driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The
    stop took place in a private driveway outside the respondent’s parents’ house.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Upon stopping the respondent, the police
    observed signs of intoxication and proceeded to arrest him. The respondent was
    subsequently charged with, and convicted of, impaired operation of a motor
    vehicle and operating a motor vehicle while “over 80” pursuant to ss. 253(1)(a)
    and 253(1)(b) (since repealed) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
    C-46. The provincial court judge sentenced him to a 12-month driving
    prohibition, imposed a $1,000 fine, and conditionally stayed the s. 253(1)(a)
    conviction pursuant to <em>Kienapple v. R</em>., [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, the summary conviction appeal judge
    overturned the s. 253(1)(b) conviction, finding that the trial judge erred in
    law by concluding that the stop was authorized under s. 48(1) of the <em>Highway
    Traffic Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (“<em>HTA</em>”). The appeal judge found the
    stop to be unlawful, breaching the respondent’s right not to be arbitrarily
    detained under s. 9 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. He
    proceeded to exclude the evidence under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em> and
    entered an acquittal.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown subsequently brought a motion for
    leave to appeal the acquittal entered by the summary conviction appeal judge. The
    Crown sought to raise the following question of law:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If a police officer forms the lawful intention
    to stop a driver on a public street for a sobriety check, but the driver turns
    on to private property before the officer can effect the stop, does the officer
    maintain authority to conduct the stop?</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown relied on s. 48(1) of the <em>HTA</em>,
    or in the alternative, the powers of the police at common law for the authority
    to conduct a stop in these circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue on appeal equally can be framed as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Should a police officer be authorized to stop
    and question a person on the person’s own private property to determine if the
    person may have been driving while impaired, when that police officer has no
    reason to suspect that the person had been drinking?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A panel of this court granted leave on August
    25, 2020, finding that the questions raised in this appeal are significant to
    the administration of justice as they deal with the lawful scope of police
    powers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal. In my view, neither the <em>HTA </em>nor the common law authorized the
    police conduct in this case. The stop violated the respondent’s s. 9 <em>Charter</em> rights, and the evidence was properly excluded.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>FACTUAL OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The relevant facts of this case are important.
    At the outset, I note that this is not a case where the driver was swerving on
    the road. It is not a case where there was a broken taillight or any other
    obvious <em>HTA</em> infractions. It is a case of a driver who drove normally
    onto their own driveway and parked. With that said, this section provides a
    detailed review of what happened in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At approximately 12:30 a.m. on March 26, 2016,
    Constable Jack Lobsinger, along with his partner, Constable Laura Hicks, were conducting
    general patrol in the area of the Thessalon First Nation. The officers observed
    a utility terrain vehicle (“UTV”) parked outside a restaurant and gas station.
    As the vehicle “seemed like it was [going to] be leaving” the parking lot, the
    officers decided to conduct a sobriety check of the driver.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The officers turned their car around and began
    following the UTV, which had exited the parking lot and was driving eastbound down
    a public road. About 200&nbsp;metres down the road, the UTV turned right and
    then left onto the private driveway of the respondent’s parents’ house<a
name="_Hlk73365744">. The driveway also provides a means of access to a
    neighbouring commercial business. </a>The police followed the UTV into the
    driveway and activated their lights to indicate to the driver that a police car
    was behind him. The officers exited their vehicle to speak with the respondent,
    who had walked around to the passenger side of the UTV. A second person was
    sitting in the passenger seat. This sequence of events occurred over the course
    of approximately one minute.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At this point, the officers did not have a
    reasonable suspicion that the respondent was connected to any particular crime.
    Constable Lobsinger testified that they did not see any signs of impairment
    prior to stopping the respondent and agreed with the suggestion of defence
    counsel that there was nothing unusual about the respondent’s driving. Rather,
    Constable Lobsinger explained that they were exercising their authority to
    conduct random sobriety checks pursuant to s.&nbsp;48(1) of the <em>HTA</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Immediately upon approaching the respondent, Constable
    Lobsinger noted that he was impaired. Specifically, he observed the following indicia
    of intoxication: the respondent was unsteady on his feet; he was hanging on to
    the side of the UTV; his knees were wobbly; his eyes were red and bloodshot;
    and there was a strong odour of alcohol on his breath. Constable Lobsinger
    testified that, when he asked the respondent if he had consumed any alcohol, the
    respondent admitted that he may have had ten beers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The officers arrested the respondent for impaired
    driving, and then transported him to a police station. At the station, the
    respondent provided two breath samples with readings of 120 and 110 milligrams
    of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, respectively. In other words, both
    readings were over the legal limit of 80&nbsp;milligrams of alcohol in 100
    millilitres of blood. While at the station, the respondent also vomited several
    times and continued to show signs of intoxication.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>DECISIONS BELOW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent brought a <em>Charter</em> application, alleging, among other things, that the stop was unlawful and constituted
    a breach of his rights under s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>. He argued that the
    police did not have authority to conduct the stop on private property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge dismissed the application,
    finding that s. 48(1) of the <em>HTA </em>provided lawful authority for the
    stop for two reasons: (1) the officers intended to stop the respondent’s
    vehicle for the purpose of checking the driver’s sobriety; and (2) they had
    formed the intention to enact the stop while the vehicle was being operated on
    a public highway. The trial judge reasoned that the “mere fact that [Constable
    Lobsinger] did not effect this stop until the [respondent] had turned into a
    private driveway and was thus on private property did not eliminate or invalidate
    the officer’s authority under s. 48(1) of the <em>Highway Traffic Act</em>.” In
    light of his conclusion on s. 48(1) of the <em>HTA</em>, the trial judge
    declined to consider whether the officers had authority under the common law to
    stop the respondent on his private driveway.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Because he considered the stop lawful, the trial
    judge concluded that the officers did not violate the respondent’s right under
    s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>. Therefore, any evidence obtained as a result of
    the stop was admissible at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Having dismissed the <em>Charter</em> application, the trial judge went on to convict the respondent of impaired
    driving and operating a motor vehicle “over 80”, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and
    253(1)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. He found that, based on the various
    indicators of intoxication, the respondent was “clearly impaired by the
    consumption of alcohol.” Both breath samples put him over 80 milligrams of
    alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. As noted above, the s. 253(1)(a)
    conviction was conditionally stayed on sentencing pursuant to the principle in <em>Kienapple</em>.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Summary Conviction Appeal Judge’s Decision</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal to the Superior Court of Justice, the
    respondent argued, among other things, that the trial judge had erred in
    finding that a police officer could conduct a sobriety stop on private property
    pursuant to s. 48(1) of the <em>HTA</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The summary conviction appeal judge allowed the
    appeal, finding that neither ss. 48(1) nor 216(1) of the <em>HTA</em> permit
    the police to conduct a sobriety or highway safety stop on private property
    absent reasonable and probable grounds. Once the respondent’s vehicle left the
    public roadway and entered the private driveway, he was no longer a “driver” within
    the meaning of the <em>HTA </em>and therefore the police did not have statutory
    authority to randomly detain him in order to check his sobriety. Additionally,
    the appeal judge found that the stop was not authorized by the common law police
    powers to protect the public, as the “public did not require protection from
    the [respondent] once he was in his private driveway”: <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;McColman, </em>2019 ONSC 5359, 381 C.C.C. (3d) 375, at para. 45. The stop was unlawful
    and thus constituted a breach of s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his analysis under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>,
    the appeal judge found that the actions of the police were serious, as the
    officers “pursued the appellant onto private property when they had neither the
    statutory or common law authority to do so”: at para. 49. The impact of the
    breach was also significant, as the respondent had a high expectation of
    privacy on his own property. While society clearly had an interest in the
    adjudication of the matter on its merits, the balancing favoured exclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted above, under the <em>HTA,</em> a
    “driver” is a “person who drives a vehicle on a highway.” Section 48(18) adds
    to this definition that a driver “includes a person who has care or control of
    a motor vehicle”. The question in this appeal is whether the respondent was
    still a “driver”, even though he was on a private driveway when he was stopped
    by police.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, it is well established that a private
    driveway is not a highway as defined in the <em>HTA</em>. This court canvassed
    the scope of the <em>HTA’</em>s definition of “highway” in <em>R. v.
    Hajivasilis</em>, 2013 ONCA 27, 114 O.R. (3d) 337. Doherty J.A. identified the
    limits of the meaning of “highway” at para. 10:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The phrase “intended for or used by the
    general public for the passage of vehicles” limits the meaning of “highway”. <span
class=Underline>If a vehicle is being driven on property to which the general
    public does not have access or if that access is for a limited purpose other
    than passage (such as parking), the property will not fall within the meaning
    of “highway”.</span> Most privately owned parking lots are not “highways” as defined
    in the <em>HTA</em>. It is accepted that the parking lot where the respondent
    allegedly struck the parked vehicle does not fall within the meaning of
    “highway” in the <em>HTA</em>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on this interpretation, a private driveway
    is not a “highway” as it is “property to which the general public does not have
    access” and it only has “a limited purpose other than passage” (i.e., parking).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Because a private driveway is not a “highway” for
    the purposes of the <em>HTA</em>, on the plain language of the <em>HTA</em>, a
    person in their private driveway cannot be a “driver” as they are not a “person
    who drives a vehicle on a <span class=Underline>highway</span>” (emphasis
    added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown does not seem to take issue with the
    fact that a private driveway cannot strictly be considered a “highway” under
    the <em>HTA</em>. This fact, according to the Crown, was not lost on the trial
    judge. Rather, the Crown argues that the officers conducted a lawful stop
    pursuant to the <em>HTA </em>because they crystallized the intention to stop
    the respondent while he was still on a public roadway. Put another way, the
    Crown contends that the officers intended to stop the respondent for a sobriety
    check while he was still a “driver” under the <em>HTA, </em>and therefore they
    were authorized to do so even though the stop occurred on private property.
    This view, according to the Crown, is consistent with a purposive and remedial
    interpretation of the <em>HTA. </em>The Crown relies on decisions from this and
    other courts which, according to the Crown, support taking a broad
    interpretation of the <em>HTA</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I cannot accept this argument. The issue is
    whether the police were acting pursuant to lawful authority at the moment when
    they conducted the stop. That authority must be exercised within the confines
    stipulated by the <em>HTA, </em>including the precondition that the person
    subject to the stop is a “driver” on a “highway”<em>. </em>The officers’
    intentions in the moments preceding the stop do not render an otherwise
    unlawful stop lawful.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As set out above, the plain language of s. 48(1)
    and the related definitions of “driver” and “highway” do not authorize random
    stops off the highway.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown relies on the purpose and context of
    the <em>HTA</em> to argue in favour of its proposed interpretation. The Crown
    points to cases from this court, including <a name="_Hlk70328177"><em>R. v. Boughen</em>,
    2002 CanLII 41476 (Ont. C.A.), </a><em>R. v. Clarke</em>, [2005] 196 C.C.C.
    (3d) 426, (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, 31012 (September&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2005),
    and <em>R. v. Lotozky</em> [2006], 210 C.C.C. (3d) 509, (Ont. C.A.), as well as
    the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in <em>R. v. Anderson</em>,
    2014 SKCA 32, 308 C.C.C. (3d) 11, which suggests that prior approaches to the
    interpretation of the <em>HTA</em> justify the expansion of the police powers
    proposed in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Respectfully, in my view, these cases do not
    assist the Crown. The Crown argues that <em>Boughen</em> and <em>Clarke</em> support the proposition that the <em>HTA</em> can authorize a stop on private
    property if the investigation commenced on the highway. These cases are
    distinguishable. In <em>Boughen</em>, the police observed an <em>HTA</em> infraction and as a result, had grounds to detain the accused under the <em>HTA</em>.
    In a brief endorsement, this court upheld the summary conviction appeal judge’s
    conclusion that the police were entitled to continue their <em>HTA</em> investigation onto private property. In <em>Clarke</em>, again, the police
    observed an <em>HTA</em> infraction, and they initiated a stop while the
    accused was still on the highway. The accused failed to stop, and only then –
    when the police had grounds to arrest the accused for failing to stop as
    required – did they follow him onto private property. These cases bear no
    similarity to the present case, which involved a random, groundless stop on
    private property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown relies on <em>Lotozky</em> in support
    of its argument that policy concerns should drive this court’s interpretation
    of s. 48(1). In that case, Rosenberg J.A. commented, at para. 37, that it “would
    not be good policy to interpret the law as encouraging motorists to avoid the
    reach of legitimate traffic investigations by heading for home and thus
    encouraging a high-speed police chase.” He held that police officers <em>who
    have reasonable grounds to suspect that a motorist is impaired</em> are
    entitled to walk up a driveway to further their investigation. Again, an
    important distinction is that the police on <em>Lotozky</em> had reasonable
    grounds. They did not select the accused at random. Notably, Rosenberg J.A. was
    interpreting the common law, and was not dealing with explicit statutory
    language. The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan’s decision in <em>Anderson</em>,
    while dealing with different statutory language, invoked similar concerns about
    escaping motorists to support the conclusion that police could pursue drivers
    off the highway and onto private property to conduct random stops: see para. 25.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no suggestion here that the respondent
    was attempting to evade the police. Indeed, it was accepted that he simply
    pulled into his driveway because he had reached his destination. A true case of
    flight might well contribute to reasonable grounds to detain the accused,
    depending on the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While, as the Crown submits, pursuant to s.
    64(1) of the <em>Legislation Act, 2006</em>, S.O. 2006, c. 21, Sched. F, the <em>HTA</em> must be interpreted “as being remedial and shall be given such fair, large and
    liberal interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects,” this court
    does not have the power to read into the <em>HTA</em> police powers the
    legislature has not seen fit to provide. Looking at the broader context of the <em>HTA</em>,
    the legislature used the word “highway” and drafted provisions that incorporate
    that definition with care:<em> Hajivasilis</em>, at paras. 27 and 35. The
    legislature chose to limit the application of some provisions of the <em>HTA</em> to the highway, while extending others off the highway: <em>Hajivasilis</em>,
    at paras. 27-40. On its terms, the police power contained in s. 48(1) is
    confined to highways. As this court observed in <em>Hajivasilis, </em>at para.
    27: “[T]he interpretive exercise must strive to give some meaning to the choice
    made by the legislature.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, since one of the necessary
    conditions for invoking the power provided by s. 48(1) cannot be met in this
    case, the police did not have statutory authority to stop the respondent in a private
    driveway. </span></p>

    law power to randomly stop vehicles in the course of protecting public
    roadways, absent reasonable suspicion: <em>Dedman v. The Queen, </em>[1985] 2
    S.C.R. 2. As the Supreme Court of Canada held in <em>Hufsky</em>, and <em>Ladouceur</em>,
    random stops for the purpose of investigating motor vehicle infringements on a
    public highway are an arbitrary detention, but are justifiable pursuant to s. 1
    of the <em>Charter. </em>However, this police power is not without its limits. As
    Cory J. noted in <em>R. v. Mellentin</em>,<em> </em>[1992] 3 S.C.R. 615, at p.
    487, this power is constrained by the purpose for which it serves:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Check stop programs result in the arbitrary
    detention of motorists. The programs are justified as a means aimed at reducing
    the terrible toll of death and injury so often occasioned by impaired drivers
    or by dangerous vehicles. The primary aim of the program is thus to check for
    sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and the mechanical fitness of cars. <span
class=Underline>The police use of check stops should not be extended beyond these
    aims. Random stop programs must not be turned into a means of conducting either
    an unfounded general inquisition or an unreasonable search.</span> [Emphasis

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, in contemplation of the scope of the

    C.C.C. (3d) 482 (Ont. C.A.)<em>, </em>at p. 491:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Dedman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at pp.

    random stops of vehicles in the course of the enforcement of laws relating to
    the operation of those vehicles. <span class=Underline>This power to stop was,
    however, closely tied to the particular purpose of the stops, the dangers
    presented by the activity targeted by the stops, the qualified nature of the
    liberty interfered with by the stops, and the absence of other less intrusive
    means of effective enforcement of the relevant laws. The authority to stop
    described in </span><em><u>Dedman</u></em><span class=Underline> was clearly
    not a general power to stop for all police purposes, but was limited to stops
    made in furtherance of the police duty to protect those who use the public
    roadways from those who use those roadways in a dangerous manner.</span> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    at issue in this appeal is whether the common law authorizes the police to
    conduct a random sobriety check on a private driveway, in circumstances not
    authorized by the <em>HTA</em>, where the person exited the highway after the
    officer decided to conduct the stop but before the officer initiated the stop,
    and there are no grounds to suspect that an offence has been or is about to be

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court has not yet weighed in on whether the
    common law should recognize this police power. We must tread lightly in doing
    so, as “[e]stablishing and restricting police powers is something that is well
    within the authority of legislatures”: <em>Fleming v. Ontario, </em>2019 SCC
    45, 437 D.L.R. (4th) 220, at para. 41. As Iacobucci J. observed in <em>R. v.
    Mann</em>, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, at para.&nbsp;17: “complex legal
    developments are best left to the experience and expertise of legislators.” This
    is particularly so when the proposed expansion in police power “would restrict
    lawful activities of individuals”: <em>Fleming, </em>at para. 5. It is
    important to bear in mind the words of La Forest J. in <em>R. v. Wong, </em>[1990]
    3 S.C.R.&nbsp;36, at p. 57, as cited in <em>Fleming, </em>at para. 4, that “it

lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That being said, the Supreme Court has been
    clear that courts “cannot abdicate their role of incrementally adapting common

    by its very nature is organic and must develop incrementally in tandem with a

    a random sobriety check on a private driveway, where there are no grounds to

    broad right to liberty enjoyed both at common law and under the <em>Charter</em>: <em>Grant</em>, at para. 19. Section 9 of the <em>Charter</em> guarantees that when

    from cases that recognized the common law power to conduct random stops on
    public roadways, such as <em>Dedman </em>and its progeny. Certainly, driving –

    of the police duties to prevent crime (impaired driving) and to protect life
    and property (the harms associated with impaired driving). Pursuing drivers off
    the highway onto private property to conduct random sobriety checks is related

    Impaired Driving Everywhere (“R.I.D.E.”) programs; (2) the statutory power
    under the <em>HTA</em> to stop drivers without any grounds for the purpose of
    checking their sobriety, so long as the statutory preconditions are met; and

    already have at their disposal to combat impaired driving, and the greater
    intrusion on liberty posed by stops on private property, I cannot conclude that
    the power to conduct a groundless stop on private property is reasonably
    necessary. The police have extensive powers to combat impaired driving, and it
    is difficult to see the need for the courts to fill a legislative gap in this
    respect. The police can conduct a random stop under s. 48(1) as soon as the
    vehicle enters the highway. They also have the option to observe the driver
    without detaining them, and based on those observations, develop a reasonable
    suspicion that would give them a basis to detain.</span></p>

    considered justified in <em>Dedman</em>, <em>Hufsky</em>, and <em>Ladouceur</em> is because of their deterrent function. In those cases, the court reasoned that
    an expectation of being randomly stopped by police on highways would deter
    people from driving under the influence: <em>Dedman</em>, at pp.&nbsp;35-36; <em>Hufsky</em>,<em> </em>at pp. 636-637, <em>Ladouceur, </em>at p. 1284. Stated otherwise, the
    arbitrary nature of the stop was justified and necessary for its deterrent
    purpose. It is not clear that adding random stops on private property enhances
    the deterrent function of these stops in any meaningful way.</span></p>

    there is no suggestion that the respondent’s actions were an artifice designed to

    immediately stop the driver to see if there is evidence to support making a
    demand.  However, where there is no indication from the manner of driving that
    the driver is intoxicated, police officers should not be entitled to follow a
    driver, after forming a crystallized intention to effect a stop, and wait to do
    so until after the driver has entered onto private property. This would allow
    the police to enter private property and detain people based on a claimed prior
    intention to stop the car, formed in the absence of any actual suspicion of
    impairment. The potential for abuse of such a power dictates against the
    recognition of the existence of such a power.</span></p>

    the detention: <em>Fleming</em>, at para. 84. Further, since the valid exercise
    of the proposed police power depends entirely on whether, in the officer’s own

    At the time of the stop, the driver was no longer on a public highway, nor was
    he even operating the motor vehicle. He had reached his destination – his home.
    He had parked the UTV on his private driveway, and he was standing outside the
    vehicle. It is undisputed that at this point the officers had no reason to

lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Impaired driving is a scourge in our society.
    Despite concerted efforts for approximately the last 40 years to eradicate the
    practice, drivers continue to operate motor vehicles while impaired by alcohol
    or drugs. They selfishly and recklessly engage in this high-risk behaviour and
    leave in their wake death, injuries and destruction. Given this pressing
    societal concern, the Supreme Court has ruled that the random stopping of
    vehicles on public streets by the police is constitutionally permissible
    because such a minimal restriction of liberty is demonstrably justified in a
    free and democratic society: see <em>R. v. Ladouceur</em>, [1990] 1 S.C.R.
    1257.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The case at bar involves an egregious example of
    impaired driving. When the police were able to catch up with the respondent and
    ask him whether he had been drinking, according to one of the police officers
    involved, he offered an honest but frightening answer, “I’ve had a few beers.
    Well, I might've had 10.&quot; After his arrest, but before the police were
    able to test his blood-alcohol level, the respondent vomited due to his
    excessive alcohol consumption. When the tests were ultimately administered,
    they showed blood alcohol levels well above the legal limit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Yet, according to the majority reasons, the
    respondent is immune from investigation or prosecution because he pulled onto
    the shared driveway that leads to his parents' house and a commercial
    establishment (a store). In effect, by pulling over to private property, the
    respondent moved into an area of legal sanctuary. The policy implications of
    the majority's decision are both evident and far-reaching.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sanctuary finding means that an impaired
    driver who the police intended to stop on a public highway is free to pull onto
    private property when the driver spots a police cruiser. This property need not
    be a place to which they have any connection or even a legal right to visit. It
    matters not that a police officer wished to conduct the random stop on a public
    highway. As long as the driver gets their vehicle onto a stretch of private
    property, sanctuary applies, and they are &quot;home free.&quot; For drivers
    who are in the process of being pulled over as part of a random stop, if they
    can pull onto private property as the safe spot to stop their vehicle, arguably
    they too will have reached sanctuary. In many cases, this sanctuary will be
    fleeting, as the impaired driver will stay on the private property only for as
    long as the police cruiser is in the area. Once it is out of sight, the driver
    will be free to re-enter the public highway and continue to endanger public
    safety.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The majority engages in a strict construction of
    the powers of a police officer to undertake a random traffic stop under the <em>Highway
    Traffic Act, </em>R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;H.8 (“<em>HTA</em>”). That construction
    leads to its sanctuary finding, which prevents the police from effectively
    carrying out their duties. This is a statutory interpretation that is contrary
    to the public safety policy imperative that animates the <em>HTA</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The majority’s approach also stands in sharp
    contrast to the reasoning of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan and the
    Ontario Superior Court in nearly identical cases: see <em>R. v. Anderson</em>,
    2014 SKCA 32, 433 Sask. R. 255, affirming 2013 SKQB 219, 422 Sask. R. 130; <em>R.
    v. Alrayyes</em>, 2013 ONSC 7256. Those courts took a purposive and
    common-sense approach to the issue and rendered decisions that facilitated the
    public safety purposes of the relevant legislation. They permitted the police
    to conduct a random stop of a driver on private property in restricted
    situations where the police formed an intention to make a stop while the
    vehicle was on a public highway.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also cannot accede to the majority’s
    conclusion that the police did not have the common law power to conduct a
    random check. Under the ancillary powers doctrine, the common law has long been
    used to fill gaps in legislation. As the Supreme Court has stated in the
    context of legislation enacted to combat impaired driving, the common law
    should be used to provide sufficient flexibility in an enforcement scheme to ensure
    that it is effective: <em>R. v. Orbanski</em>; <em>R. v. Elias</em>, 2005 SCC
    37, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 45.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Finally, this case is another example of the cursory application of
    the test mandated by <em>R. v. Grant</em>, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, in
    determining whether evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <em>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. The appeal judge's reasons on this
    critical issue are one paragraph in length, and are factually and legally
    flawed. As will be discussed, the focus of s. 24(2) is societal; it aims to
    preserve the integrity of the justice system in a manner that is reflective of
    societal values. Courts should not lose sight of the fact that the Grant test
    requires careful consideration of its lines of inquiry to determine whether,
    considered objectively, the overall repute of the justice system will be
    adversely impacted by the admission of the impugned evidence. When courts do
    not engage in a meaningful s. 24(2) analysis and automatically exclude evidence
    because there has been a <em>Charter</em> breach, they fail in their duty to
    protect the integrity of the justice system. In this case, on a proper
    application of the <em>Grant</em> test, the evidence should not have been
    excluded.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>On March 25, 2016, at approximately 12:30 a.m., Constable Jeff
    Lobsinger, who was on general patrol with Constable Laura Hicks, spotted an
    all-terrain vehicle (“ATV”) parked outside a convenience store at the Thessalon
    First Nation. The respondent, Walker McColman, was the driver.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As the ATV left the parking lot, Constable Lobsinger directed
    Constable Hicks to U-turn the police cruiser and followed the ATV on the public
    highway. The trial judge found as a fact that while the respondent was driving
    on a public highway, Constable Lobsinger decided to conduct a random sobriety
    stop pursuant to s. 48(1) of the <em>HTA</em>. At trial, the officer fairly
    conceded that there were no signs of impaired driving that otherwise warranted
    a stop.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>When the officers caught up to the respondent, he had pulled off the
    public highway and stopped in the middle of a driveway that served a commercial
    property and the respondent’s parents’ home. There was no suggestion at trial
    that the respondent pulled into the shared driveway to avoid the police. The
    police activated the cruiser’s roof lights and approached the respondent’s
    vehicle. From the time of spotting the vehicle to the time of the stop,
    approximately one minute had elapsed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>At the stop, Constable Lobsinger spoke to the respondent and
    observed obvious signs of impairment, including trouble standing despite
    hanging on to the side of the vehicle, a strong odour of alcohol, bloodshot
    eyes, and mumbling speech. As noted above, according to Constable Lobsinger,
    the respondent told him that he had consumed excessive amounts of alcohol that
    evening. Constable Lobsinger arrested the respondent for impaired driving at
    12:36 a.m. A breathalyzer test was delayed at the police station because the
    respondent vomited due to his alcohol consumption. Two breathalyzer tests were
    eventually conducted, which recorded his blood alcohol concentration level at
    120 and 110&nbsp;milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>PROCEEDINGS BELOW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The respondent brought an application alleging breaches of ss. 8, 9,
    and 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. That application was dismissed by the trial
    judge, who found in regard to the alleged s. 9 breach that Constable Lobsinger
    formed his intention to stop the respondent on the public highway and, as a
    result, the officers’ authority under the <em>HTA</em> to stop the vehicle
    continued after the respondent turned onto the shared driveway. In reaching
    this conclusion, the trial judge rejected the defence theories that Constable
    Lobsinger did not subjectively intend to stop the respondent on the highway for
    a sobriety check and was instead motivated by animus due to an interaction with
    the respondent some three years earlier. The trial judge did not consider any
    common law authority to stop the vehicle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The respondent was found guilty of both impaired driving and over 80&nbsp;operation
    of a motor vehicle. The trial judge conditionally stayed the impaired driving
    conviction under s. 253(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
    C-46, and sentenced the respondent to the mandatory minimums of a $1,000 fine
    (plus a $300 victim surcharge) and a 12-month driving prohibition.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>On appeal to the Summary Conviction Appeal Court, the appeal judge
    held that the officer had no statutory or common law authority to stop the
    respondent on the shared driveway. Consequently, he found a breach of s. 9 and
    then excluded all evidence that resulted from the sobriety check under s.
    24(2). After excluding the evidence, he acquitted the respondent.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As I will explain, I believe that the appeal judge erred in his
    statutory interpretation of the <em>HTA</em>. Specifically, he failed to take a
    purposive approach to the legislation and instead interpreted it in a manner
    contrary to the public safety protections that underlie the statute. I am also
    of the view that the appeal judge erred in his consideration of the officers’
    common law powers, and would find that the officers had the common law power to
    conduct the stop if they were not permitted to do so under the <em>HTA</em>.
    Finally, the appeal judge engaged in a cursory and error-filled s. 24(2)
    analysis, which this court owes no deference. On a proper <em>Grant</em> analysis, the evidence should not have been excluded. Each of these issues will
    be considered in turn below.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The statutory authority for random sobriety checks is found in s.
    48(1) of the <em>HTA</em>, which provides:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>48(1) A police officer, readily identifiable
    as such, may require the driver of a motor vehicle to stop for the purpose of
    determining whether or not there is evidence to justify making a demand under

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Supreme Court found that a provision in a previous iteration of
    the <em>HTA</em> requiring motorists to stop when directed to do so by a police
    officer was constitutionally valid under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em> because
    random sobriety checks are reasonably and demonstrably justified in a free and
    democratic society. In reaching this conclusion, the court found overwhelming
    evidence of the direct connection between serious accidents and driving under
    the influence of alcohol or drugs: <em>Ladouceur</em>, at p. 1282. It also
    found that the absence of spot checks means that “impaired drivers could easily
    avoid the consequences of their dangerous misconduct”: <em>Ladouceur</em>, at
    p. 1285.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Instructive for present purposes are the court's comments regarding
    the limited nature of the privacy intrusion occasioned by these stops. The
    court noted that driving is a licensed activity, the stops are relatively
    short, the driver is minimally inconvenienced, and the officer's investigation
    is restricted to the purpose of the check: <em>Ladouceur</em>, at pp. 1285-87.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits that the appeal judge erred in taking a narrow and
    restrictive interpretation of the random stopping powers of the police under
    the <em>HTA</em>. It argues for a police power under the <em>HTA</em> to check
    sobriety on private property provided that the following elements are present:
    (i) the police officer observes the driver operating on a highway; (ii) the
    police officer forms the intention to stop the driver for a sobriety check
    while the driver is still on the highway; and (iii) although the driver leaves
    the highway and enters private property before the stop is conducted, the
    events constitute one continuous investigative transaction. It is necessary to
    undertake a statutory interpretation analysis of the <em>HTA</em> to consider
    this submission.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The law regarding the correct approach to statutory interpretation
    is well settled and need not be considered in detail here. As Côté J. recently
    stated in <em>1704604 Ontario Ltd. v. Pointes Protection Association</em>, 2020
    SCC 22, 449 D.L.R. (4th) 1, at para. 6: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[6] Indeed, this Court has reiterated on
    numerous occasions that the modern approach to statutory interpretation
    requires that the words of a statute be read “in their entire context and in
    their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act,
    the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament” (E. A. Driedger, <em>Construction
    of Statutes</em> (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87, quoted in <em>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo
    Shoes Ltd. (Re)</em>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21).</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Proper statutory interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of
    the legislation alone: <em>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), </em>[1998] 1
    S.C.R. 27, at para. 21. Watt J.A. in <em>R. v. Stipo</em>, 2019 ONCA 3, 144
    O.R. (3d) 145, at para. 176, described the preferred statutory interpretation
    approach this way:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[176] This preferred approach recognizes the
    significant role that context must play when courts construe the written words
    of a statute. No statutory provision is an island in itself. Its words take their
    colour from their surroundings: <em>Bell ExpressVu</em>, at para. 27. All
    issues of statutory interpretation involve the fundamental question of what
    Parliament intended. To discover what Parliament intended, we look at the words
    of the provision, informed by its history, context and purpose: <em>R. v.
    Mabior</em>, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at para.&nbsp;20.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Thus, even where the words of the statute appear to be clear on
    their face, the reviewing court must examine whether the words truly reflect
    the intention of the legislature. It is well established in the jurisprudence
    of this court and the Supreme Court that it is necessary to consider the entire
    context before settling on what appears, at first blush, to be the plain
    meaning of a legislative provision: see <em>Solar Power Network Inc. v.
    ClearFlow Energy Finance Corp.</em>, 2018 ONCA 727, 426 D.L.R. (4th) 308, at

lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>To be clear, I do not take issue with the conclusion of the appeal
    judge and the majority in this court that, at first blush, an operator of a
    motor vehicle on private property does not meet the definition of a driver in
    the <em>HTA</em> because a driver is defined as a person who drives a vehicle
    on a highway, and the definition of a highway does not include private
    property. The difficulty I have with their interpretation is that after
    considering the plain meaning of the words used in the <em>HTA</em>, they
    stopped their analysis. That is a legally unsound practice when undertaking
    statutory interpretation. It divorces context and purpose from the exercise and
    may lead, as in this case, to a restricted analysis that reaches a conclusion
    contrary to the legislative purpose underlying the legislation.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[50] Bearing that caution in mind, the case

    over-all sense the Legislature is directing itself to the regulation of
    vehicular traffic and not to commerce conducted in or by means of vehicles.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[51] In my view, regulation to protect the
    public using the province's roads is not necessarily limited to roads that fall
    within the meaning of &quot;highway&quot; in the Act. Public safety concerns
    might well demand regulation in respect of traffic in large private parking
    facilities even though those facilities are not used by the general public for
    &quot;the passage of vehicles&quot;. Similarly, public safety concerns might
    well demand the regulation of private parking facilities as incidental to
    regulations maintaining the safety of the &quot;highway&quot; leading into and
    out of that facility.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that although the investigating officer
    formulated the intention to stop the accused’s vehicle pursuant to s. 209.1
    while he was operating his motor vehicle on a public highway, the stop was
    arbitrary because the officer did not take steps to carry out the stop before
    the accused crossed onto private property. On appeal to the Court of Queen’s
    Bench for Saskatchewan, that decision was overturned. Popescul C.J.Q.B.,
    reasoned, at paras. 31-34:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[31] The defendant was on a public highway.
    The investigating officer did form the intention to check the defendant for
    legislatively authorized purposes prior to him turning onto a private lot. The
    police must be allowed &quot;sufficient flexibility to be effective”.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[32] Further, entering onto the private lot to
    complete the check stop was reasonably necessary having regard to the nature of
    the liberty interfered with and the public purpose served. The interference was
    minimal. In the event, for example, that the defendant had not been driving
    after consuming alcohol, the episode would have been over.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[33] The public purpose served is significant.
    Giving the police the authority to stop vehicles randomly in order to, among
    other things, check for sobriety is intended to reduce the carnage on our roads
    by preventing and deterring those who might be inclined to drive after drinking
    too much alcohol.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[34] To restrict that police power merely
    because a driver happens to have turned onto a private lot does not make sense
    or advance the administration of justice. As recognized by the trial judge:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[30] ... This is not to say that a driver
    becomes untouchable and immune from investigation and police inquiries by
    simply breaking the plane of the goal line, so to speak, and crossing onto

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan affirmed the decision of the
    Queen’s Bench. They did not give effect to the same argument advanced in this
    case, <em>viz.</em>, that the power of the police officer to stop the vehicle
    was eliminated once it entered private property. In rejecting that argument,
    the court reasoned, at paras.&nbsp;24-25, as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[24] It is a fact found by the trial judge
    that the police officer formed the intention to stop the appellant prior to the
    appellant turning onto private property. In my view, the police officer must be
    allowed sufficient flexibility in carrying out his duties to complete that
    lawful activity. Interference with the appellant here was minimal and the entry
    onto private property, to complete the check stop, was reasonably necessary,
    having regard to the nature of the liberty interfered with and the public purpose
    served by the interference.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[25] To decide otherwise would encourage
    drivers to seek the sanctuary of private roadways if they suspected they were
    about to be stopped by police. In the circumstances of this case, where a
    police officer has formed the intention to stop a driver on a public highway
    pursuant to s. 209.1 of <em>The</em> <em>Traffic Safety Act</em>, the police
    officer is acting within the statutory authority by following the driver onto
    private property in order to complete his investigation.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>In my view, the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan took the correct

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In <em>Alrayyes</em>, a police officer observed the accused driving
    a motor vehicle leaving the parking lot of a strip mall. The officer followed
    the vehicle, watching as it entered the highway, drove some distance, then
    exited the highway into a gas station. The trial judge found that the officer
    formed the intention to stop the vehicle pursuant to s. 48 of the <em>HTA</em> before the vehicle pulled off the highway into the gas station, but delayed
    signalling the vehicle to stop as he was at an intersection and did not want to
    confuse other drivers. Before the officer was able to activate the lights on
    his police cruiser at a safe location, the accused’s vehicle had already turned
    into the gas station. The officer carried out the random stop at the gas
    station.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Thus, the circumstances are nearly identical to the situation in the
    present case. The police officer formed an intention to conduct a random stop
    of a driver on a public highway, and before he was able to activate his
    emergency lights, the driver pulled onto private property. Miller J. then put
    the issue in its proper legal context as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[12] It is clear from the Supreme Court of
    Canada decision in <em>R. v. Mansour</em>, [1979] S.C.J. No. 77, that a
    &quot;highway&quot; under the <em>Highway Traffic Act</em> does not include a
    parking lot.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[13] The Ontario Court of Appeal in <em>R. v.
    Hajivasilis</em>, [2013] O.J. No. 253, recently considered whether all
    provisions of the <em>Highway Traffic Act</em> are applicable only to
    &quot;highways.&quot; The Court concluded that each provision has to be
    considered according to the way in which it is worded. Doherty, J.A. indicated
    at paragraph 13 that, for example, a &quot;driver&quot; under s. 48 of the <em>Highway
    Traffic Act</em> means &quot;‘a person who drives a vehicle on a highway’. A
    person driving a motor vehicle on a private parking lot is at least arguably
    not a driver for the purposes of the <em>HTA</em>.”</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[14] Both the Appellant and the Respondent
    agree that paragraph 13 of <em>Hajivasilis</em> is obiter, and that the word
    &quot;arguably&quot; leaves open whether a &quot;driver&quot; may be stopped
    pursuant to s. 48 of the <em>Highway Traffic Act</em> once the driver has left
    a &quot;highway&quot; on which he or she was previously observed to be driving,
    and entered onto private property.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[21] There is no issue that if police have
    reasonable grounds to believe an offence is being committed they may pursue a
    vehicle, and the driver of that vehicle onto private property in order to
    continue their investigation and/or to effect an arrest if in hot pursuit. <em>R.
    v. Macooh</em>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 802; <em>R. v. Boughen</em>, [2002] O.J. No.
    4060 (C.A.) There is no suggestion that either situation existed here.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[22] There is no issue that reasonable grounds
    to stop a vehicle, except under the authority of s. 48(1) of the <em>Highway
    Traffic Act</em>, are necessary otherwise the detention resulting from the stop
    would be arbitrary and therefore contrary to s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[23] There is no issue that s. 48(1) of the <em>Highway
    Traffic Act </em>does not give police authority to stop a vehicle being driven
    solely on private property. <em>R. v. Campbell</em>, [2009] O.J. No. 1534
    (O.C.J.); <em>R. v. Cordeiro</em>, [2009] O.J. No. 4923; <em>R. v. Tresham</em>,
    [1998] O.J. No. 1744 (G.D.).</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[24] The question is whether s. 48(1) of the <em>Highway
    Traffic Act</em> authorises police, who have observed a vehicle to be driving
    on a highway, to effect a stop of that vehicle once it has entered onto private
    property.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Miller J. went on to summarize the parties' positions, which are
    similar to the submissions made on this appeal. The defence argued that since <em>Ladouceur</em> found that the power to randomly stop vehicles was only saved by s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em> as rationally and proportionally addressing the pressing and substantial
    concern in relation to the safe operation of vehicles on our highways, once the
    vehicle left the highway, that safety concern was no longer engaged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown argued that to require the police to stop a vehicle
    driving on a highway only while it remains on the highway would be illogical
    and contrary to the object of the <em>HTA</em> as &quot;public welfare
    legislation designed to protect those who use the roads of the province&quot;
    per para. 33 of this court’s decision in <em>R. v. Raham</em>, 2010 ONCA 206,

lang=EN-CA>In the end, Miller J. agreed with the approach of the Court of

    31, as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[31] [P]olice must be given reasonable
    flexibility in carrying out their duties. I am satisfied that if a vehicle is
    observed by police to be driving on a “highway” as defined by the <em>Highway

    the <em>Highway Traffic Act</em> does not come to an end simply because the
    vehicle enters onto private property. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>In my view, the interpretation favoured by the appeal judge and the
    majority in this court is contrary to the public protection purpose of the <em>HTA</em>.
    It allows motorists, like the respondent, to avoid the power of the police to
    conduct random stops by pulling their vehicle onto private property. The
    majority's sanctuary finding means that impaired drivers will be encouraged to
    drive onto private property any time they see a police cruiser in the area,
    even though a police officer formed an intention to conduct a random stop of
    them on a public highway. As noted above, the impaired driver need not have any
    connection to the private property, and in many cases, the sanctuary will be
    short-lived.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>For drivers who are in the process of being pulled over as part of a
    random stop, s. 216(1) of the <em>HTA</em> requires them to pull over to a safe
    place. With the majority's sanctuary ruling, impaired drivers will undoubtedly
    select a spot on private property as the safe place to stop their vehicle. Once
    they have done so, they too will arguably have reached sanctuary and will be
    immune from investigation. Again, when the police cruiser leaves the area, they
    will be free to continue to put public safety at risk.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Can it credibly be argued that these results were what the
    legislature intended in enacting the <em>HTA</em>? My view is that the
    sanctuary finding, which will inevitably endanger public safety, could not have
    been intended by a legislature passing a statute enacted to protect public
    safety. It is also essential to recognize that the Crown is not submitting that
    the random stop power should be expanded to private property in all situations.
    Its reasonable and sensible position is restricted to situations where the police
    officer formed the intention to make the random stop on a public highway, and
    the stop is carried out on private property as part of one continuous
    transaction.</span></p>

    It makes practical sense, gives effect to the legislature's intention, and
    provides sufficient flexibility for the legislation to be effective. I would
    adopt the Crown’s interpretation of the <em>HTA</em> and find that the officers
    in this case had the authority to make the stop on the shared driveway.</span></p>

    then the common law should fill the gap because the police should not be

    question that the common law can be adapted through the ancillary powers

    if two requirements are met: (i) the police must have been acting within the
    general scope of a statutory or common law police duty; and (ii) the conduct in
    question must involve a justifiable exercise of police powers associated with
    that duty: <em>Fleming</em>, at para. 46. This test, which has long been

    S.C.), undertook a comprehensive review of the law in this area in
    circumstances where the police investigated the driver of a vehicle sitting in
    the parking lot of a bar. She found that the officers had no power to investigate
    the vehicle under the <em>HTA</em>. In considering their common law powers,
    Molloy J. relied on the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Dedman v. The Queen</em>,
    [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2, in concluding that the police had the common law power to
    detain the accused for a spot check. <em>Dedman</em>, which involved a traffic
    stop under the “Reduce Impaired Driving Everywhere” (“R.I.D.E.”) program, was
    decided before the enactment of s. 48(1) of the <em>HTA</em>. Therefore, the
    validity of the random check in that case was dependent on whether the police
    had a common law power to stop the vehicle.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In <em>Dedman</em>, Le Dain J., writing for the court, held that
    there was common law authority to randomly stop a vehicle for the purpose
    contemplated by the R.I.D.E. program. His conclusion on the second branch of the <em>Waterfield</em> test, at pp. 35-36, was as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Because of the seriousness of the problem of
    impaired driving, there can be no doubt about the importance and necessity of a
    program to improve the deterrence of it. The right to circulate on the highway
    free from unreasonable interference is an important one, but it is, as I have
    said, a licensed activity subject to regulation and control in the interest of
    safety. The objectionable nature of a random stop is chiefly that it is made on
    a purely arbitrary basis, without any grounds for suspicion or belief that the
    particular driver has committed or is committing an offence. It is this aspect
    of the random stop that makes it capable of producing unpleasant psychological
    effects for the innocent driver. These effects, however, would tend to be
    minimized by the well&#8209;publicized nature of the program, which is a
    necessary feature of its deterrent purpose. Moreover, the stop would be of
    relatively short duration and of slight inconvenience. Weighing these factors,
    I am of the opinion that having regard to the importance of the public purpose
    served, the random stop, as a police action necessary to the carrying out of
    that purpose, was not an unreasonable interference with the right to circulate
    on the public highway. It was not, therefore, an unjustifiable use of a power
    associated with the police duty, within the <em>Waterfield</em> test. </span></p>

    because the accused was no longer a driver under the <em>HTA</em> when he
    parked his vehicle. The trial judge excluded the evidence and acquitted the
    accused. On appeal to Fregeau&nbsp;J., sitting in the Summary Conviction Appeal
    Court, the appeal judge upheld the trial judge’s ruling regarding the <em>HTA</em>.
    However, he went on to find that the police officer was acting within his
    common law authority when he stopped and detained the respondent in the hotel
    parking lot. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Fregeau J. observed that in order to randomly detain a motorist
    without reasonable grounds for suspecting that person has committed a crime,
    the police must be acting legitimately out of a concern for the protection of
    the public in relation to the operation of a motor vehicle: <em>Nield</em>, at
    para. 43. He accepted Molloy J.’s conclusion that assuming the police had a
    valid common law power to detain the accused for investigative purposes, there
    is no principled reason to find that such power was lost because the detention
    occurred in a parking lot adjacent to a roadway from which he had just left: <em>Nield</em>,
    at para. 50.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There can be little doubt that the first requirement of the
    ancillary powers doctrine has been satisfied in this case. A police officer's
    general scope of duties includes preserving the peace, preventing crime, and
    protecting life and property: <em>Fleming</em>, at para. 69. Where, as in the
    instant case, there has been a finding of fact that the purpose of the stop was
    to ensure that a driver was not impaired, the police are acting in the exercise
    of a lawful duty: <em>Dillon</em>, at para. 49.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Turning to the second requirement, the effort to prevent impaired
    driving is unquestionably important to the performance of the duty to the
    public good. The significant role of random stops in combating impaired driving
    has been accepted since <em>Dedman</em> and has been recognized in subsequent Supreme
    Court jurisprudence, including in <em>Ladouceur</em>, at p. 1282, and <em>R. v.
    Hufsky</em>, [1988] 1 S.C.R.&nbsp;621, at p. 636.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In undertaking his analysis on the second requirement, the appeal
    judge found that public safety was no longer a relevant consideration because the
    respondent had reached the driveway of his residence, and there was no evidence
    that he intended to return to the highway. I agree with the Crown that this
    finding is problematic for three reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First,</span><span lang=EN-CA> it ignores the public benefit from the
    deterrent effect of random sobriety checks. There is an overall benefit to
    public safety when drivers cannot avoid random sobriety checks by simply
    leaving the highway.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second</span><span lang=EN-CA>, the appeal judge failed to properly
    apply the evidence from the trial in undertaking his analysis. That evidence
    did not support that the police knew that the respondent had reached his residence
    at the time of the stop. On the contrary, Constable Lobsinger testified that he
    believed that the respondent had entered the driveway of another convenience
    store.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA> Third, this argument - that any public safety concern ends when a
    driver reaches private property - has been rejected in the jurisprudence: see <em>Nield</em>,
    at paras. 46-50. Further, as Rosenberg J.A. stated in <em>R. v. Lotozky</em> (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 335 (C.A.), at para. 37, the police do not need to wait
    and see if a driver on private property will return to the highway:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[37] [U]ntil the impaired driving complaint
    was investigated there was a risk that an impaired driver would re-enter the
    vehicle and drive while impaired. It is not reasonable to expect the police to
    devote resources to waiting outside the motorist’s house until he or she returns
    to the street.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Regarding the necessity of the interference with individual liberty
    for the performance of the duty, it is obvious that a vehicle must be stopped,
    and that the officer must have some interaction with the driver for the
    screening process to be effective. In this regard, the comments of Charron J.
    in <em>Orbanski</em>, at para. 45, are apt:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[45] The screening of drivers necessarily
    requires a certain degree of interaction between police officers and motorists
    at the roadside.…The scope of justifiable police conduct will not always be
    defined by express wording found in a statute but, rather, according to the
    purpose of the police power in question and by the particular circumstances in
    which it is exercised. Hence, it is inevitable that common law principles will
    need to be invoked to determine the scope of permissible police action under
    any statute. In this context, it becomes particularly important to keep in mind
    that any enforcement scheme must allow sufficient flexibility to be effective.
    The police power to check for sobriety, as any other power, is not without its
    limits; it is circumscribed, in the words of the majority of this Court in <em>Dedman </em>by that which is “necessary for the carrying out of the particular police
    duty and it must be reasonable, having regard to the nature of the liberty
    interfered with and the importance of the public purpose served by the
    interference” (p. 35). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Finally, a random stop occasions minimal interference with
    individual liberty. Driving is not a fundamental liberty, like the ordinary
    right of movement of the individual. Rather, it is a licenced activity that is
    subject to state control to protect life and property: <em>Dedman</em>, at p.
    35. Further, as noted by the Supreme Court in <em>Ladouceur</em>, at pp.
    1286-87, random stops are brief, minimally inconvenience the driver, and are
    restricted to the purpose of the check.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, if the officers did not have authority under s. 48(1) of
    the <em>HTA</em> to make the stop on the shared driveway, they had the common
    law authority to do so. This is an instance where any gaps in the legislative
    scheme should be filled by the common law to ensure that the screening regime
    is effective.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The trial judge did not undertake a s. 24(2) analysis because he
    found no <em>Charter</em> violation. The appeal judge’s s. 24(2) analysis, in
    its entirety, is as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The actions of the police are serious. They pursued
    the appellant onto private property when they had neither the statutory nor
    common law authority to do so. The <em>Charter</em>-protected interest to be
    protected is one of privacy. The expectation of privacy on one’s own property
    is a high one. As to the third test set out in <em>Grant</em>, clearly society
    has an interest in having the matter adjudicated on its merits. Having said
    that, when all three factors are balanced, the balance favours the exclusion of
    evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This cursory s. 24(2) analysis is consistent with a pattern we see
    in this court where lower courts undertake a detailed review of whether there
    has been a <em>Charter</em> breach and then treat the <em>Grant</em> test as a
    required, but ultimately meaningless, ritual to be undertaken on the road to
    the inevitable exclusion of evidence. In short, it is not sufficient to recite
    the lines of inquiry from <em>Grant</em>, make some conclusory statements, and
    then exclude the evidence. As I will explain, the proper application of the <em>Grant</em> lines of inquiry is as important as the analysis of whether there has been a <em>Charter</em> breach.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It is helpful at this juncture to take a step back and consider the
    purpose of s. 24(2). It was designed to ensure that the <em>Charter</em> appropriately balanced individual and societal interests when it came to the
    exclusion of evidence obtained through state misconduct. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Prior to the enactment of the <em>Charter</em>, Canadian courts
    rarely excluded evidence, regardless of the extent of police misconduct in
    obtaining the same. As one commentator put it, “[t]he court’s search for the
    truth trumped any interest in procedural fairness or in protecting the rights
    of an accused”.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[4]</span></span></span></a> Consistent with this jurisprudence, an early draft of the <em>Charter</em> contained
    an express provision that prohibited the exclusion of evidence on the basis
    that it was obtained pursuant to a <em>Charter</em> breach. Some members of the
    legal community protested this draft provision. Ultimately, a Special Joint
    Committee of the House of Commons and the Senate determined that an exclusion
    clause should be included in the <em>Charter</em>.<a href="#_ftn5"

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In creating an exclusion clause, the drafters of the <em>Charter</em> developed a compromise approach, which balanced individual and societal rights.
    Dickson C.J. described it this way in <em>R. v. Simmons</em>, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
    495, at p. 532:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The final question in this appeal is whether
    the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. As
    Lamer J. noted in <em>R. v. Collins</em>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, the <em>Charter</em> enshrines a position with respect to evidence obtained in violation of <em>Charter</em> rights that falls between two extremes. Section 24(2) rejects the American rule
    that automatically excludes evidence obtained in violation of the Bill of
    Rights (see, for example, <em>Weeks v. United States</em>, 232 U.S. 383 (1914),
    and <em>Mapp v. Ohio</em>, 367 U.S. 643 (1961)). It also shuns the position at
    common law that all relevant evidence is admissible no matter how it was
    obtained (see <em>R. v. Wray</em>, [1971] S.C.R. 272). Evidence may be excluded
    under s. 24(2) if having regard to all the circumstances, it is established
    that the admission of it would bring the administration of justice into
    disrepute. The person seeking to exclude the evidence bears the burden of
    persuading the Court, on a balance of probabilities, that admission of the
    evidence could bring the administration of justice into disrepute in the eyes
    of a reasonable person, &quot;dispassionate and fully apprised of the
    circumstances of the case&quot; (<em>Collins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at p. 282).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Clearly, in rejecting the American approach, the drafters of the <em>Charter</em> wanted to avoid situations where serious charges were not determined on the
    merits because of technical, minor, or good faith mistakes by police. Thus, when
    judges undertake a s. 24(2) analysis, their role is to uphold the delicate
    balance that underlies the <em>Charter</em>. They abrogate that responsibility
    when they default to the American approach rejected by the drafters of the <em>Charter</em>.
    Judges must not lose sight of the fact that s. 24(2) not only provides an
    effective remedy for the accused, it also serves to preserve the integrity of
    the justice system in a manner that is reflective of societal values.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It is also helpful to consider what the Supreme Court was trying to
    achieve in <em>Grant</em> when it formulated a new test for the exclusion of
    evidence under s. 24(2). It has been twelve years since the decision was
    released, and cases like the one at bar suggest that the thinking behind the
    test has become obscured over time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Prior to <em>Grant</em>, the jurisprudence under s. 24(2) had
    developed rigid rules for the exclusion of certain types of evidence: see <em>R.
    v. Collins</em>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265; <em>R. v. Stillman</em>, [1997] 1 S.C.R.
    607. The court in <em>Grant</em> found that these rules were inconsistent with
    s. 24(2), noting, at para. 65: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[65] It is difficult to reconcile trial
    fairness as a multifaceted and contextual concept with a near-automatic
    presumption that admission of a broad class of evidence will render a trial
    unfair, regardless of the circumstances in which it was obtained.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>A new approach was necessary to ensure that the circumstances of the <em>Charter</em> breach were fully explored and weighed in determining whether
    to exclude evidence. The court stressed that s. 24(2) is aimed at protecting
    the integrity of, and public confidence in, the justice system. It instructed
    that a court considering s. 24(2) must look objectively at whether the overall
    repute of the justice system, viewed in the long term, will be adversely
    affected by the admission of the impugned evidence: <em>Grant</em>, at para.
    68.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Consistent with the comments of Dickson C.J. in <em>Simmons</em>,
    the court in <em>Grant</em> emphasized, at para. 70, that at its core, this
    exercise is societal in its focus:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[70] Finally, s. 24(2)'s focus is societal. Section
    24(2) is not aimed at punishing the police or providing compensation to the
    accused, but rather at systemic concerns. The s. 24(2) focus is on the broad
    impact of admission of the evidence on the long-term repute of the justice
    system.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Under <em>Grant</em>, the court is mandated to consider the interest
    of society in having an adjudication on the merits. This interest is balanced
    against the seriousness of the <em>Charter</em>-infringing state misconduct,
    and the impact of the breach on the <em>Charter</em>-protected interests of the
    accused. It is not every <em>Charter</em> breach that trumps the legitimate
    societal interest in seeing criminal cases determined on their merits. The <em>Grant</em> analysis is designed to determine whether a <em>Charter</em> breach is one that
    is excusable in the circumstances, or one that requires the court to dissociate
    itself with the state misconduct because to do otherwise would bring the
    administration of justice into disrepute. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The point I am making is that <em>Grant</em> calls for a thoughtful
    and nuanced balancing of factors. A judge on a s. 24(2) application is required
    to carefully review the circumstances of the case and consider the relevant
    lines of inquiry in undertaking the ultimate balancing exercise to determine
    whether the evidence should be excluded: see <em>R. v. Shinkewski</em>, 2012
    SKCA 63, 399 Sask. R. 11, at para. 38. To properly complete this exercise, the
    court should engage in a methodical analysis of all of the lines of inquiry and
    should not let one factor trump or overwhelm the others: <em>R. v. Archambault</em>,
    2012 QCCA 20, 307 C.C.C. (3d) 151, at para. 69, leave to appeal refused, [2012]
    S.C.C.A. No. 426; <em>R. v. Fan</em>, 2017 BCCA 99, 352 C.C.C. (3d) 280, at
    para. 68. By that standard, the analysis undertaken by the appeal judge does
    not suffice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Normally, where a trial judge has considered the proper factors
    under <em>Grant</em> and has not made any unreasonable finding, their determination
    is owed considerable deference on appellate review: <em>R. v. Côté</em>, 2011
    SCC 46, [2011] 3&nbsp;S.C.R. 215, at para. 44. However, where a trial judge commits
    a legal error, makes unreasonable findings, or fails to properly engage in a
    meaningful s. 24(2) analysis, on appeal, that judge's decision is not entitled
    to deference, and the appeal court may conduct the s. 24(2) analysis afresh: <em>R.
    v. Dunkley</em>, 2016 ONCA 597, 131 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 54; <em>R. v.

lang=EN-CA>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>With that background in mind, I turn now to a consideration of the

    exercise to determine whether the evidence in this case should be excluded. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appeal judge found that the misconduct of the officers was
    serious because they did not have the statutory or common law power to make the
    stop on private property. That conclusion is nothing more than a bald statement
    that the respondent’s <em>Charter</em> rights were breached. It misses the
    point of the exercise entirely because it does not advance the analysis of the
    seriousness of state misconduct.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It is a given that the respondent’s rights were breached; that is
    why a s. 24(2) analysis was being undertaken. As Miller J.A. stated in <em>R.
    v. Jennings</em>, 2018 ONCA&nbsp;260, 45 C.R. (7th) 224, it is a legal error to
    conclude that the state misconduct must be serious because there has been a <em>Charter</em> breach. Rather, as he said, at para.&nbsp;26, of that case, &quot;there must be
    some examination of the police conduct and a determination of where it fits on
    a spectrum from mere technical breaches at one end to bad faith violations at
    the other.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It is worth reiterating that the whole purpose of the <em>Grant</em> test is to move away from exclusions of evidence based on rigid categories and
    instead to evaluate the circumstances of the case to determine whether the
    admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into
    disrepute. On this prong of the test, a judge hearing a s. 24(2) application
    must carefully consider the seriousness of the state’s misconduct in breaching
    the <em>Charter</em> and place that misconduct on a spectrum from serious to
    trivial. The appeal judge failed to do that.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Grant</em>, <em>Charter</em>-infringing
    state misconduct varies in seriousness. Inadvertent or minor violations of the <em>Charter</em> will have a minimal impact on public confidence in the rule of law, whereas
    evidence obtained through willful or reckless disregard of <em>Charter</em> rights poses a very serious risk of bringing the administration of justice into
    disrepute. Such willful or reckless disregard sends the message that courts
    &quot;effectively condone state deviation from the rule of law&quot;: <em>Grant</em>,
    at paras. 72-75.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>On a proper review of the evidence in the instant case there is
    nothing to suggest that the officers were not operating in good faith. In this
    regard, I note that the trial judge rejected the defence argument that
    Constable Lobsinger’s actions were motivated by personal animus against the
    respondent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Another relevant factor in evaluating the seriousness of state
    misconduct is uncertainty regarding the state of the law. Where a police
    officer ignores established legal principles or is willfully blind to the same,
    our courts will not countenance this conduct: see <em>Grant</em> at para. 75; <em>R.
    v. Buhay</em>, 2003 SCC 30, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 59; and <em>R. v.
    Tsekouras</em>, 2017 ONCA 290, 353 C.C.C. (3d) 349, at para. 109, leave to
    appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 225. <em>Charter</em> rights are of limited
    value if police officers are permitted to ignore them or remain willfully
    ignorant of those rights. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Supreme Court has consistently
    held that legal uncertainty is a factor that a court may take into account in assessing
    the seriousness of a <em>Charter</em> breach resulting from police misconduct. As
    Moldaver J. stated in <em>R. v. Paterson</em>, 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R.
    202, at para. 92:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[92] Where the law is evolving or in a state
    of uncertainty, and where the police are found to have acted in good faith,
    without ignorance or wilful or flagrant disregard of an accused’s <em>Charter</em> rights, the seriousness of the breach may be attenuated: see <em>R. v. Cole</em>,
    2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at paras. </span><span lang=FR-CA>86-89; <em>R.

lang=EN-CA>Contrary to the assertion made by the majority in this case, the
    limits on police authority to continue the traffic stop on the shared driveway
    were not well settled. However, to the extent that there was applicable
    jurisprudence, such as <em>Anderson</em> and <em>Alrayyes</em>, it supported
    the officer’s authority to make the stop on the shared driveway.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In addition to those cases, in <em>R. v. Calder</em>, [2002] O.J.
    No. 3021 (S.C.), aff’d [2004] O.J. No. 451 (C.A.), the Summary Conviction
    Appeal Court judge considered whether s. 48(1) of the <em>HTA</em> applied to a
    parking lot behind a bank. There, the officer observed a vehicle on the road
    and then approached the car in a parking lot because it was &quot;oddly
    parked.&quot; The trial judge held that the police officer had no legal
    justification for approaching the appellant's vehicle absent some basis for
    thinking that the appellant violated the <em>HTA</em> or some other
    legislation. In allowing the Crown appeal, Killeen J. held, at para. 57:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[57] In leading cases such as <em>R. v.
    Mansour</em> (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 129 (S.C.C.) and <em>Gill et al. v. Elwood</em> (1970), 9 D.L.R. (3d) 681 (Ont. C.A.) it has been held that driving conduct on
    a parking lot cannot give rise to an <em>HTA</em> or <em>Code</em> driving
    charge, but these cases have not held that the police investigative powers set
    out in s. 33(1), 48(1) and 216(1) are magically suspended or exhausted at the
    curb of a public street.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Calder</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> was followed in <em>R. v. Warha</em>,
    2015 ONCJ 214, aff’d 2016 ONSC 93, which involved a situation where a police
    officer watched a vehicle on the road, but did not observe any signs of
    impairment. He followed the car to the parking lot of a plaza, walked up to the
    driver, and detected alcohol on his breath. In rejecting an assertion by the
    defence that this interaction violated the driver's ss. 8, 9 and 10 <em>Charter</em> rights, the court found, at para. 7, that “[t]he law does not require him to
    have observed any improper driving or be suspicious that Mr. Warha might be
    impaired.&quot; The fact that the driver was on private property was found not
    to restrict the authority of the officer to conduct an <em>HTA</em> investigation. That finding was upheld on appeal: <em>Warha</em> <em>(2016)</em>,
    at para. 3. A similar finding was made in <em>R. v. McGregor</em>, 2015 ONCJ
    692, at paras. 10-14.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[176]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As noted above, in <em>Nield</em>, the court held that the <em>HTA</em> does not provide authority to undertake a sobriety check on private property.
    However, as discussed, in that case, the court found that the police did have
    the common law power to do so.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While police officers cannot ignore <em>Charter</em> rights or
    established limitations on their authority, they are also not expected to weigh
    debatable constitutional niceties in the context of a dynamic interaction with
    a member of the public. In this case, if the officers could have stopped time
    and inquired of a constitutional expert whether they had the authority to
    continue the traffic stop, they may well have received an answer that,
    according to the two cases closest to their fact situation, being <em>Anderson</em> and <em>Alrayyes</em>, they had the authority to make the stop on the shared
    driveway. Given the state of the law, the officers' actions do not even rise to
    the level of negligence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, the state misconduct was minor or technical in nature.
    This was a dynamic situation where there was jurisprudence that supported the
    officers’ authority to make the stop on the shared driveway. </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Put another way, if the police officers in this case made a mistake
    about the legality of the random stop on the shared driveway, so too did the </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Court of Appeal for S</span><span lang=EN-CA>askatchewan and Miller
    J. of the Ontario Superior Court. </span><span lang=EN-CA>This line of inquiry,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Turning to the impact of the breach on the <em>Charter</em>-protected
    interests of the respondent, the more serious the impact on the accused’s
    protected interests, the greater the risk that admission of the evidence may
    signal to the public that <em>Charter</em> rights, however high-sounding, are
    of little actual avail to the citizen, thereby breeding public cynicism and
    bringing the administration of justice into disrepute: <em>Grant</em>, at para.
    76.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appeal judge’s consideration of this factor does not advance the
    analysis. His statement that the <em>Charter</em>-protected interest was
    privacy and that “[t]he expectation of privacy on one’s own property is a high
    one” is flawed. The stop took place on the shared driveway that leads to the
    respondent's parents' home and a store. The shared driveway was not solely for
    the respondent's parents’ property. It was also a means of access to the
    commercial business. In these circumstances, there was an implied licence for
    members of the public, including the police, to enter the shared driveway, and
    any privacy expectation held by the respondent would be minimal: <em>Dillon</em>,
    at para. 40. This is hardly comparable to the police kicking down the door of a
    private residence. Yet, the appeal judge’s analysis makes no distinction
    between these two disparate situations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In addition, the investigation started on a public highway, a domain
    where the respondent had a minimal privacy right. Further, as stated by the
    Supreme Court in <em>Ladouceur</em>, driving is a licensed activity, random
    stops are relatively short, the driver is minimally inconvenienced, and the officer's
    investigation is restricted to the purpose of the check. In this case, the
    traffic stop was not invasive, as the indicia of impairment was evident as the
    officer approached the respondent. In my view, taking into account all of these
    facts, this factor militates against the exclusion of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><span lang=EN-CA>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Society’s interests in an adjudication on the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The third <em>Grant</em> factor considers society’s interests in an
    adjudication on the merits. This line of inquiry “asks whether the
    truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by
    admission of the evidence, or by its exclusion”: <em>Grant</em>, at para. 79.
    The reliability and importance of the evidence are crucial factors in this line
    of inquiry: <em>Grant</em>, at paras. 81-83.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This factor favours the admission of the evidence. Society has a
    legitimate interest in seeing cases of impaired driving adjudicated on the
    merits. The excluded evidence, which included the respondent’s statement about
    his alcohol consumption, the officer’s observation of his obvious signs of
    impairment, and the results of the breathalyzer tests, was reliable. It was
    also overwhelming proof of the respondent’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on
    both counts. The exclusion of this reliable evidence resulted in the acquittal
    of the respondent.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>In balancing the <em>Grant</em> factors, all three lines of inquiry
    favour the admission of the evidence. Viewed objectively, any breach was done
    in good faith and was minor or technical in nature, the impact on the
    respondent’s <em>Charter</em> protected rights was minimal, and the evidence
    was reliable and crucial in the convictions registered by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>With the admission of the evidence, a reasonable person, informed of
    all relevant circumstances and the values underlying the <em>Charter</em>, </span><span
lang=EN-CA>would not lose faith in the criminal justice system or believe that
    the administration of justice had been brought into disrepute. On the contrary,
    the exclusion of reliable and crucial evidence based on a restrictive and
    technical view of police power would likely cause the public to lose faith and
    confidence in our criminal justice system</span><span lang=EN-CA>. I would,
