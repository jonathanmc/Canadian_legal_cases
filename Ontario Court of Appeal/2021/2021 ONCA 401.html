    and J.C. testified that the complainants had objected to the poor living conditions
    at their parents’ home and had said that they wanted to stay permanently with
    the appellant and J.C. The appellant and J.C. referred to notes reflecting this
    perspective written by the complainants before their CAS interviews. The complainants,
    however, testified that J.C. made them write those notes to prepare for the

    about the degrading conditions in their parents’ home. They testified that they
    did not tell the CAS that the appellant sexually abused them. At the
    preliminary inquiry, D.&nbsp;testified that she did not disclose the abuse
    because J.C. was listening in the next room and “she would get mad at me if I
    told anything of that”. S. testified that she did not do so because the
    appellant and J.C. “scared me and they used to always tell us … what happens in

    had fabricated the allegations of sexual abuse after the CAS investigation. He claimed
    the records would allow him to compare the complainants’ testimony at the

    He argued there was an evidentiary basis to seek the records because at the

    Both complainants testified in a way he found “compelling, candid, sincere, and
    believable”. Their evidence was “measured” and the “detail which they provided
    of what transpired in their young lives” was “persuasive”. They “acknowledged
    where there was an inconsistency and explained where their memory was not clear”.
    There was “no evidence of exaggeration or fabrication”. The trial judge found no

    to him was precluded based on a misinterpretation of s. 278.3(4).</span></p>

    established that the CAS records related to the complainants’ credibility was
    amply supported by the record and attracts appellate deference, despite his
    error of law in applying the “likely relevance” standard. The appellant adduced
    case-specific evidence or information that the records were likely relevant to <span
style='color:black'>the complainants’ credibility through </span>the complainants’
    admissions at the preliminary inquiry <span style='color:black'>that </span>they
    had lied to the CAS during their interviews in August 2015. This evidence established
    a reasonable possibility that the CAS records would have potential impeachment
    value because they would allow a comparison of what the CAS recorded with what
    the complainants testified they told the CAS. The potential impeachment value of
    the CAS records was therefore not speculative. As trial counsel for the
    appellant stated on the application for production, the appellant was seeking
    “verification” of what the complainants actually said to the CAS because they
    now acknowledged that they lied to the CAS. Trial counsel stated that “[t]his
    is an attempt to challenge the [complainants’] credibility regarding the
    evidence that the [complainants] have actually given about statements they’ve
    made to CAS”. The complainants’ admissions at the preliminary inquiry thus provided
    an evidentiary basis for a reasonable possibility that the CAS records would be
    logically probative of the complainants’ credibility, and met the likely
    relevance standard.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Crown nevertheless asserts that the CAS records “could provide
    nothing of value beyond that which the defence already had” because the
    complainants had already admitted at the preliminary inquiry that they lied to
    the CAS. Moreover, the Crown notes that there was no suggestion that the
    records contained any information about the allegations against the appellant,
    as the complainants stated that they never told the CAS that the appellant
    sexually abused them.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These considerations do not undercut the
    conclusion that the appellant had established a reasonable possibility, based
    on case-specific evidence, that the records contained information useful for
    impeachment. Even so, the points raised by the Crown are important. That the
    defence already knew that the complainants lied to the CAS and that the records
    contain no allegations of sexual abuse against the appellant should be
    considered in weighing whether disclosure is “necessary in the interests of
    justice”. Similarly, that the records contain no allegations of sexual abuse
    against the appellant means that the records may have low probative value and
    did not form part of the case he had to meet, factors that may be considered in
    weighing whether disclosure to the judge is “necessary in the interests of
    justice”. As I explain below, these are significant considerations that weigh against
    disclosure to the <span style='color:black'>judge in this case</span>.</span></p>

    wish to acknowledge that since preparing these reasons I have had the benefit

    disagree with how she applies the statutory test and the governing jurisprudence
    for production of third-party records, I will not address our disagreements point

    Respectfully, I do not agree. Before this court, neither the appellant’s factum
    nor his oral argument addressed or even mentioned motive to fabricate as a
    basis for the “likely relevance” of the CAS records, nor was this issue mentioned
    in the Crown’s factum or oral argument. Instead, the appellant raised, and the
    Crown addressed, only the arguments that I have considered above. In these

    appellant’s right to full answer and defence, in balancing the appellant’s
    right to full answer and defence against the complainants’ rights to privacy,
    personal security, and equality based on the factors in s. 278.5(2); and (3)
    conflating “likely relevance” with “necessary in the interests of justice”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, although the trial judge cited case law referring
    to “therapeutic” records as one type of highly private record “often” found in the
    possession of child welfare authorities, he did not suggest that all records held
    by a child welfare authority are necessarily therapeutic or counselling records
    or that the records here were therapeutic or counselling records. He understood
    that the appellant was not seeking therapeutic or counselling records: on the application,
    the appellant’s trial counsel<span style='color:black'> </span>confirmed that she
    sought only records relating to the interviews “in August of 2015 and any
    follow-up from that” and “no other involvement of this family” and,
    specifically, not records of “counselling being provided to the complainants or
    any member of this family”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also see no error in the trial judge’s
    conclusion that the CAS records sought here attracted a high expectation of
    privacy, even though they were not therapeutic or counselling records. Parliament
    specifically listed “child welfare” records as a class of records that
    presumptively attract a reasonable expectation of privacy, whether or not they
    relate to counselling or therapy. Records in the possession of child welfare authorities
    can be “multifaceted” and “often involve documentation regarding counselling
    and therapy” (<em>R. v. J.B.</em>, 2013 ONSC 481, at para. 28), but they need
    not do so to warrant high privacy protection.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>In this regard, </span><span
lang=EN-CA>I agree with the reasons expressed by Katarynych J. in <em>R. v.
    T.F.</em>, 2009 ONCJ 656, [2009] O.J. No. 5802, at paras. 93-121, for rejecting
    the proposition that child welfare records attract lesser privacy protection
    when they do not relate to the children’s counselling or therapy. As Katarynych
    J. explained, child welfare records, even when not relating to counselling or
    therapy, can “overarch the whole of a foster child’s life in foster care” and include </span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>“</span><span lang=EN-CA>particularly
    intrusive documentation of very personal information”: para. 97. They can “reach
    much deeper into a foster child’s life and times than records of a course of
    therapy”, and therefore deserve similar privacy protection to “thoughts laid
    bare during a course of therapy”: at para. 110. Trust-like relationships
    developed by children with child welfare authorities can be a “powerful
    endorsement of that child’s worth” and a key to the child’s “growth and
    development within the foster care system”: at para. 111. As Katarynych J. observed,
    “[a] foster child’s trust and communication to persons who have earned [the
    child’s] trust are deserving of protection. The communications within those
    trust-like relationships emerge from the trust, and establishing trust is tough
    in foster care”: at para. 114.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Applications for production of child welfare
    records implicate not only the privacy but also the equality of the affected
    children because those children’s lives have been “heavily documented” by child
    welfare authorities: <em>Mills</em>, at para.&nbsp;92; see also <em>R. v.
    Medwid</em>, [2008] O.J. No. 4614 (S.C.), at para. 21. Through no fault of
    their own, such children are at risk of being treated with less dignity and as
    less worthy of respect and consideration than other children whose lives have
    not been heavily documented by the state.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I therefore reject the appellant’s contention that
    the trial judge misunderstood <span style='color:black'>the nature of </span>the
    CAS documents <span style='color:black'>at issue </span>or <span
style='color:black'>that </span>those documents were entitled to lesser
    protection than counselling records.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, I see no basis to accept the appellant’s
    claim that the trial judge ignored the appellant’s right to make full answer
    and defence in balancing that right with the complainants’ rights to privacy,
    personal security, and equality based on the factors in s. 278.5(2). The trial
    judge noted that he had to be “satisfied that the records are likely relevant
    to an issue at trial and that production is necessary in the interest of
    justice”. He then said that he had “given specific consideration to the
    criteria set out in sub-section 278.5(2) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> and
    278.3(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>”. He cited from <em>Mills</em>, at para.
    61, which directs that the rights to be balanced include “full answer and
    defence, privacy, and equality”. Finally, he discussed the “very high” privacy
    rights attaching to CAS records and concluded that, although the complainants
    had admitted that they lied to the CAS, “investigating the records to determine
    the extent of their lies is insufficient for this Court to review the records”.
    The trial judge’s explicit statement and his process of analysis refute the claim <span style='color:black'>that </span>he ignored the appellant’s right to make full
    answer and defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>In effect, the </span><span
lang=EN-CA>trial judge ruled that because the complainants had admitted they
    lied to the CAS, the appellant had what he needed to challenge the
    complainants’ credibility without invading their privacy and equality rights.
    Whether the information sought from the third-party records is available from
    other sources is a proper consideration to weigh in determining whether
    disclosure is “necessary in the interests of justice”: see s. 278.5(2)(a); <em>Clifford</em>,
    at para. 65. In <em>Clifford</em>, at para. 65, Rosenberg J.A. noted that “[l]ikely
    relevance is not the sole consideration” in ordering disclosure of third-party
    records to the judge and that s.&nbsp;278.5 “permits the judge to take into
    account a broader range of interests”, including “the privacy rights of the complainant”
    and whether “the information sought from [the third-party records] could be
    obtained from other sources.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the trial judge’s oral reasons are
    brief and somewhat conclusory, I read them as having determined that the CAS
    records affected the appellant’s right to make full answer and defence only
    marginally and that any impact was substantially outweighed by the impact
    disclosure would have on the complainants’ rights to privacy and equality. The
    records had limited impact on the appellant’s right to full answer and defence
    because: (i) the records were of relatively low probative value as they related
    to CAS interviews more than a year before the complainants first alleged that
    the appellant had sexually abused them; and (ii) the appellant already had what
    he needed to challenge the complainants’ credibility arising from those
    interviews because the complainants admitted at the preliminary inquiry <span
style='color:black'>that </span>they had lied to the CAS.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s approach reflected the
    observations in <em>Mills</em>, at para.&nbsp;131, that “[w]here the privacy
    right in a record is strong and the record is of low probative value or relates
    to a peripheral issue, the judge might decide that non-disclosure will not
    prejudice the accused’s right to full answer and defence and dismiss the
    application for production.” Because the records to which the appellant sought
    access were not part of the case he had to meet, the complainants’ significant privacy
    and equality rights weighed more heavily in the balance: see <em>Mills</em>, at
    para. 71. I therefore see no error in the trial judge’s conclusion. It attracts <span style='color:black'>deference </span>on appeal: <em>Sutherland</em>, at
    para. 13.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, I reject the appellant’s assertion that
    the trial judge conflated the “likely relevance” threshold and the “necessary
    in the interests of justice” analysis. His argument relies on the following
    passage of the trial judge’s reasons, which he says shows the trial judge based
    his conclusion on “necessary in the interests of justice” <span
style='color:black'>entirely </span>on his conclusion that the appellant had
    failed to establish “likely relevance”:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The accused has <u>not satisfied me</u> that apart
    from the possibility that the records would contain inconsistent statements by
    the complainants <u>that the records are relevant to an issue at trial. <b>Accordingly</b>,
    I am not satisfied that production of the records is necessary in the interest
    of justice</u>. Accordingly, the accused’s application is dismissed.
    [Appellant’s emphasis.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits <span style='color:black'>that </span>this passage shows that “the trial judge saw ‘likely relevance’ as a
    prerequisite to meet the ‘interests of justice’ threshold”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not agree. Although I accept <span
style='color:black'>that </span>this passage is poorly worded, I am satisfied
    that the trial judge considered whether disclosure was “necessary in the
    interests of justice” and weighed the factors <span style='color:black'>listed </span>in
    s. 278.5(2) — which is what he said he did. The trial judge’s reasons show <span
style='color:black'>that </span>he weighed “the extent to which the record is
    necessary for the accused to make a full answer and defence” (s.&nbsp;278.5(2)(a)),
    “the nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to
    the record” (s. 278.5(2)(c)), and “the potential prejudice to the personal
    dignity and right to privacy of any person to whom the record relates” (s.&nbsp;278.5(2)(e)).
    He concluded that the significant impact of disclosure on the complainants’
    rights to privacy and equality outweighed any minimal impact on the appellant’s
    right to full answer and defence. I see no basis to interfere with that conclusion.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>My colleague highlights that at trial the centrality
    of the CAS investigation played out exactly as the defence said it would on the
    third-party records application, though she notes this is not relied on to show
    why it was necessary in the interests of justice for the trial judge to review
    the records. The third-party records application must be reviewed on the basis of
    the information available to the trial judge at the time of the application. The
    appellant could have renewed the application as the trial unfolded: <em>Mills</em>,
    at para. 145; <em>Clifford</em>, at paras.&nbsp;57, 64 and 67. He chose not to do
    so. In any event, the appellant’s right to make full answer and defence to the
    charges against him and to respond to the case he had to meet was not
    compromised. He received a fair trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I therefore conclude that the trial judge did

    the trial judge erred by doubting the appellant’s credibility based on the
    appellant’s inconsistent evidence about a “‘bus stop’ incident” in May 2016, nine
    months after the complainants had returned to their parents’ home. The
    appellant gave this evidence in chief in response to a question about why the
    complainants might have fabricated the allegations of abuse against him. He
    said he and his wife stopped at S.’s bus stop and called her over to their car.
    He said she was crying and said her parents were saying the appellant and his
    wife were bad and evil people and she felt like her parents were brainwashing
    her. After giving this evidence, the appellant was impeached on cross-examination.
    He had told the police in his videotaped statement <span style='color:black'>that </span>he “ran into” S. at the bus stop, but <span style='color:black'>at trial </span>he admitted this was not true and he and his wife had gone to the bus
    stop specifically to see S., even though in 2015 he had been told by the
    complainants’ mother to have no further contact with them. He also acknowledged
    that he had intentionally withheld information from the police during his police
    statement about what S. had said at the bus stop to “see if it was useful … within
    the court”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant says that the trial judge erred in
    treating this evidence as going to his credibility rather than his reliability.
    He claims the evidence had nothing to do with the allegations of sexual abuse. I
    disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence on the bus stop incident occurred
    at a critical moment in the trial when the appellant was presenting his theory
    of the complainants’ motive to fabricate. The appellant was impeached on that
    evidence and he admitted that he had misled the police and intentionally withheld
    information from them. This evidence thus spoke directly to his credibility. The
    trial judge determined that the appellant’s evidence gave him “great concern”
    and was “confused at best, and wholly inconsistent, at worst”. I see no error
    in the trial judge relying on this evidence to evaluate the appellant’s credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also disagree with the appellant’s claim <span
style='color:black'>that </span>this evidence was immaterial to the sexual
    abuse allegations. The evidence spoke to the appellant’s credibility, the
    central <span style='color:black'>issue at trial</span>. The trial judge could
    consider that the appellant had been successfully impeached when trying to explain
    the complainants’ motive to fabricate and his reason for intentionally withholding
    information from and misleading the police.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant claims that the trial
    judge improperly found him not credible in part by relying on inconsistencies
    in his wife’s evidence. Those inconsistencies related to when the appellant and
    his wife had tenants in their basement and when the appellant stopped storing
    his work clothes in the room where the complainants slept.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree that the trial judge disbelieved aspects
    of the evidence of the appellant’s wife. He noted that she changed her evidence
    when advised of her husband’s evidence about when the appellant’s clothes were
    no longer stored in the complainants’ room and he found her evidence “made no
    sense”. He found “[m]ore troubling” her awareness of the complainants’ in-court
    testimony about the abuse having taken place in the basement, despite an order
    excluding witnesses. However, I do not read the trial judge’s reasons as having
    rejected the appellant’s denials based on having rejected his wife’s evidence. Instead,
    the trial judge properly addressed the wife’s evidence because that was part of
    the defence evidence before him. Far from disclosing error, the trial judge was
    simply weighing the evidence of all the witnesses in deciding whether he had a
    reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Lastly, </span><span
lang=EN-CA>the appellant asserts that the trial judge failed to address material
    inconsistencies in the complainants’ evidence. He accepts that the trial judge said
    he was “[s]ensitive to the inconsistencies in their evidence” but claims that
    his analysis of the complainants’ credibility was “generic and vague”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept this submission. The trial judge
    amply explained his basis for believing the complainants’ evidence. After comprehensively
    reviewing their evidence, he explained that their “detail[ed]” and “measured”
    accounts were persuasive partly because they “acknowledged where there was an
    inconsistency and explained where their memory was not clear”. He found no material
    inconsistencies relating to the sexual abuse allegations. Both complainants testified
    that they were sexually abused by the appellant over several years. Both said
    he came into their room at night, touched their arms and legs, and sometimes
    touched their vaginas. Both said he did this when retrieving his clothes for
    work the next day. And both recalled an incident in the basement when he was
    watching pornography on the television.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s reasons explain why he
    accepted the complainants’ evidence that the appellant had sexually abused them,
    why he rejected the appellant’s denials, and why the evidence <span
style='color:black'>as a whole </span>did not leave him with a reasonable
    doubt. The trial judge examined the complainants’ evidence under a common-sense
    approach, mindful that they were recounting events that happened when they were
    young children and that any frailties in their evidence related to peripheral,
    not core, issues.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I therefore conclude that the trial judge made
    no error in his credibility assessments. The appellant’s arguments on uneven
    scrutiny and insufficiency of reasons amount to mere disagreement with the
    credibility findings. The trial judge <span style='color:black'>was entitled to
    disbelieve </span>the appellant’s denials of the abuse and his reasons amply
    permit appellate review. I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, on the sentence appeal, the appellant submits
    that the trial judge erred in his treatment of certain mitigating and

lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant does not argue that the five-year
    sentence imposed for the serious sexual offences against two young complainants
    was demonstrably unfit. Instead, he asserts that the trial judge made several
    errors of principle that warrant appellate intervention.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant asserts that the trial judge
    improperly discounted the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation and failed
    to give effect to mitigating factors because he noted that the appellant’s positive
    antecedents were “not at all unusual for sexual offenders in these
    circumstances”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept this argument. The trial judge
    did consider the appellant’s positive antecedents as mitigating factors. He
    noted that the appellant’s presentence report spoke well of him, he was a contributing
    member to his family and community, and he had no criminal record. But the
    trial judge gave these factors less weight, as he was entitled to do, because sexual
    misconduct involving children often occurs in private and will not be reflected
    in the offender’s reputation in the community. As the trial judge appropriately
    noted, citing <em>R. v. G.W.</em>, 2017 ONSC 3149, at para. 27, “often those
    who commit such deplorable, deviant, self-gratifying sexual acts upon children
    as he has in private present as trustworthy and respectable publicly.” I see no
    error in that approach.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant asserts that the trial judge
    erred by highlighting as an aggravating factor that the complainants were “much
    younger than 18 years of age”. The appellant says that because he was sentenced
    for convictions under ss.&nbsp;151 and 152 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which
    require the Crown to establish that the victim was under 16 years of age, “[t]he
    fact that the victims were children cannot be an aggravating factor”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept this submission. In <em>Friesen</em>,
    the Supreme Court stated that “[t]he age of the victim is also a significant
    aggravating factor.… [C]hildren who are victimized at a younger age must endure
    the consequential harm of sexual violence for a longer period of time than
    persons victimized later in life”: at para.&nbsp;134. The court held that the
    specific age of the victim is relevant “to both the gravity of the offence and the
    degree of responsibility of the offender” because the “power imbalance between
    children and adults is even more pronounced for younger children”: at paras.
    134-35. The court also ruled that “the moral blameworthiness of the offender is
    enhanced when the victim is particularly young and is thus even more vulnerable
    to sexual violence”: at para. 135.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was thus entirely proper for the trial judge
    to consider as an aggravating factor that the complainants were young children when
    the appellant sexually abused them, beginning when they were less than 10 years
    of age. The trial judge was also entitled to find that the complainants “had [nowhere]
    to turn” while they lived with the appellant and his wife. As the Supreme Court
    has recognized, younger children are “often helpless without the protection and
    care of their parents” — their “dependency is usually total”: <em>Friesen</em>,
    at para. 134, citing <em>R. v. Magoon</em>, 2018 SCC 14, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 309,
    at para. 66.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the appellant notes that the trial judge “did
    not refer to the defence’s position on sentence, not even in passing”. The defence
    had sought a sentence in the range of three to four years. The appellant
    asserts that the trial judge’s failure to mention the sentence sought by the
    appellant resulted in a sentence that “lacked sufficient analysis and now
    frustrates appellate review”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I disagree. The reasons must be read alongside
    the submissions of counsel, which clearly articulated the appellant’s position
    on sentence. Read as a whole, the reasons sufficiently explain why the
    appellant was sentenced to five years in prison given the prevailing case law. The
    sentence imposed heeded the “strong message” sent by the Supreme Court in <em>Friesen</em>,
    that “sexual offences against children are violent crimes that wrongfully
    exploit children’s vulnerability and cause profound harm to children, families,
    and communities”: at para. 5. The Supreme Court directed that sentences for sexual
    assaults against children “must increase” and that “mid-single digit
    penitentiary terms” are “normal” and “upper-single digit and double-digit
    penitentiary terms” are “neither unusual nor reserved for rare or exceptional
    circumstances”: at paras. 5, 114.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a result, the reasons permit effective
    appellate review: <em>R. v. Sheppard</em>, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    CAS.” Respectfully, while the CAS records would certainly provide the
    opportunity for conducting this comparative exercise between what the
    complainants testified to and what they said on an earlier occasion, that could
    be said for many third-party records applications. In my view, something more
    is required to cloak the records in likely relevance. In this case, that
    something more came from S.’s handwritten notes and the evidence elicited at
    the preliminary inquiry.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Handwritten Notes</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The handwritten notes were written by one of the complainants, S.,
    in preparation for the interviews with the CAS. At the preliminary inquiry, S.
    claimed to have written those notes at the behest of and with the assistance of
    the appellant’s wife. The defence counsel used the content of the handwritten
    notes at the preliminary inquiry to question the complainants during
    cross-examination.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There was a stark contrast between what was contained in the notes
    and the sexual abuse that was reported only after the CAS investigation was
    complete and the complainants had returned to live at their parental home.
    Among other things, the notes suggested that the complainants were emotionally
    and physically abused in their parental home. They also suggested that the
    complainants were called highly derogatory names in that home, none of which
    are necessary to repeat in these reasons. In a different series of handwritten
    notes titled “What goes on in the [parental] house!”, S. also suggested that
    she and her sister were forced to take naked photos of their mother. S. also
    wrote that she was “scared to go [to the parental] home because they will keep
    and abuse me again and again”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Conversely, the handwritten notes suggested that the appellant and
    his wife made the complainants “feel safe” and that they had been with them for
    “10 ½ yrs [sic] and have yet seen [<em>sic</em>] them yell punch hit sware [<em>sic</em>]
    or <span class=Underline>abuse us in any way</span>” (emphasis added). The
    notes also referenced the fact that the appellant and his wife would “take
    care” of the complainants and “support [them] all the way.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There is no dispute that the notes were written at a time when the
    sexual assaults, which had been allegedly occurring over many years, were said
    to be still taking place. Indeed, the indictment framed the offences as
    occurring between February 1, 2008 and August 31, 2015. The CAS investigation
    was commenced in August 2015.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The complainants and their mother testified at the preliminary

lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The defence counsel went into the preliminary inquiry armed with
    S.’s handwritten notes. The complainants were then questioned about what they
    had said to the CAS worker. They admitted to telling the CAS worker about the
    abusive conduct they said they were enduring in the parental home. They also
    admitted that they said nothing to the CAS worker about the sexual abuse
    perpetrated in the appellant’s home. Indeed, both complainants admitted that
    they had told the CAS worker that they did not want to return to their parental
    home, as they wished to reside with the appellant and his wife. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While admitting they had said those general things to the CAS
    worker, the complainants attempted to distance themselves from those statements
    at the preliminary inquiry. The reversal of their position was dramatic. At the
    preliminary inquiry, both complainants said that they actually did not want to
    reside with the appellant and his wife. They suggested that some of the things
    they told the CAS worker were lies. In the case of D., she admitted that she
    knew that what she said could carry “consequences”, including that she could
    have been removed from her parental home.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The complainants offered multiple explanations for why they said
    that they lied to the CAS worker, including that: (1) they had been
    “brainwashed” by the appellant’s wife into saying what they said; (2) S.
    admitted that she has a history of exaggerating and would sometimes “cry wolf”
    and lie; (3) D. admitted that she has memory problems; and (4) D. and the
    complainants’ mother testified that both complainants had fetal alcohol
    syndrome, with D. testifying that this condition made her “gullible … [and]
    easy to play with”. As well, both complainants suggested that the appellant’s
    wife, whom they said they were afraid of, was surreptitiously listening in on
    the CAS interviews from a different room in the appellant’s home, making it
    harder for them to tell the truth to the CAS worker. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The complainants’ mother also testified at the preliminary inquiry.
    She explained how it first came to be that the complainants started staying with
    the appellant and his wife. The relationship commenced as one involving paid
    respite care for the complainants because their parents were struggling with so
    many children, many of whom had significant needs. It eventually turned into a
    more long-term relationship, one where the complainants had come to refer to
    the appellant and his wife as “Papa” and “Nana” and would frequently go stay at
    their home, including for long periods of time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The mother acknowledged also being swept up in the CAS investigation.
    She maintained that the allegations were unfounded. She further claimed that
    the complainants had told her that they made those allegations because the
    appellant and his wife had promised them electronics and shopping trips. The
    mother also maintained that the appellant and his wife wanted the complainants
    to be in their home to help with housework and grocery shopping. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The complainants’ mother expressed the view that the appellant and
    his wife were using the CAS to attempt to keep her children: “they were using
    Children’s Aid to – to keep my children.” She admitted: “I was angry. I was
    upset. I was hurt. I wanted my girls home.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant argued at the third-party records application that the
    CAS records were relevant to two issues at trial: (1) to impeach the
    credibility of the complainants; and (2) to support the argument that the
    complainants had a motive to fabricate the allegations of sexual assault

    complainants and their mother were represented by counsel during the
    third-party records application, and they opposed the production of the CAS
    records. The Crown who appeared at the third-party records application took no
    position.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>At the third-party records application, the appellant pointed out
    that the complainants apparently went from expressing their desire to live with
    the appellant and his wife to claiming that they had been seriously sexually
    abused by the appellant in that home for many years. The only thing that had
    changed between the CAS investigation and the reporting of the allegations to
    the police was that the complainants had returned home to live with their
    parents. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As the defence counsel put it in the third-party records
    application, “[s]uddenly, after CAS completes their investigation, the complainants
    completely change their story about their experiences with the [appellant and
    his wife].” The defence said that the records would reveal exactly what was
    said to the CAS worker by the complainants, and those details could be used to
    underscore the complete “change [in] their story”. In addition, the defence
    argued that the records would provide better insight into the scope of the CAS
    investigation, thereby underscoring the motive to fabricate that was said to
    arise from the mother’s anger over the fact of the CAS investigation.</span></p>

    Records</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, the CAS records were likely relevant to the issues of
    credibility and motive to fabricate. The CAS investigation stood at the heart
    of the appellant’s defence, and the CAS file on the matter constituted the only
    independent record of what actually happened in the investigation and what the
    complainants actually said to the CAS worker. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The defence should not have been required to rely upon the testimony
    of the complainants for an accurate recounting of what they told the CAS
    worker. Whether they lied to the CAS or not was not the question requiring
    resolution on the third-party records application. While the complainants said
    they lied to the CAS worker, maybe they did lie or maybe they did not lie. That
    would be a question for the trier of fact. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The sole question for the resolution of the first step of the first
    stage of the third-party records analysis – “likely relevance” – was whether
    there was a “reasonable possibility” that the information contained in the
    records would be “logically probative” to an issue at trial: <em>Mills</em>, at
    para. 45, citing <em>R. v. O’Connor</em>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 22, per
    Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J. (dissenting, but not on this point). In my view, the
    CAS records were logically probative for exactly the reasons the defence
    counsel said at the third-party records application. Perhaps most powerfully,
    there was more than a “reasonable possibility” that they would contain
    statements made to a CAS worker that were the exact opposite of what the
    complainants were going to testify to at trial. In my view, the defence should
    not have had to rely upon the complainants, who candidly acknowledged having
    some difficulty with truth-telling, to catalogue the things that they said to
    the CAS worker.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While I do not suggest for a moment that statements of that nature
    cannot coexist with conditions of sexual abuse, and indeed they sometimes will,
    this does not undermine the fact that such statements can be logically
    probative of issues of credibility and reliability. Therefore, I see the likely
    relevance of the CAS records in this case as extending well beyond having some
    potential impeachment value arising from inconsistencies that may materialize
    through a comparative exercise between the CAS records and what the
    complainants testified they told the CAS. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the entire CAS investigation was said to be the catalyst
    for a motive to fabricate. As Doherty J.A. said in <em>Batte</em>, at para.
    120: “It is difficult to think of a factor which, as a matter of common sense
    and life experience, would be more germane to a witness’ credibility than the
    existence of a motive to fabricate evidence.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There is no magic in the use of the term “motive to fabricate”
    because, at its core, it just means that there exists a reason for why someone
    might lie. The trial judge dealt with the motive to fabricate/reason to lie
    defence position in his ruling, the ruling appealed from, referencing the fact
    that: “The defence argues on this application that the mother may have
    manipulated [the complainants] out of anger and frustration as a result of the
    CAS investigation.” There was an evidentiary foundation for that position, as
    reflected in the transcript of the mother’s testimony from the preliminary
    inquiry, which transcript formed part of the record placed before the trial
    judge during the third-party records application, and which transcript the
    parties agree is properly part of the record on appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As the appellant argued in his factum and in oral submissions on
    appeal, the evidentiary foundation on the third-party records application,
    including the preliminary inquiry evidence, demonstrates the “major concerns
    about [the complainants’] reliability and credibility”. In this regard, the
    appellant emphasized in his factum on appeal the following passage from the
    trial judge’s ruling:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In their preliminary inquiry evidence, the
    complainants testified that they spoke well of [the appellant] and his wife and
    poorly about their mother’s home. <b>Then, when the CAS investigation was
    completed, <u>the complainants suddenly and completely changed their story</u>,
    raising new allegations against [the appellant]</b>. [Emphasis in the
    appellant’s factum.]</span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The “completely changed
    their story” language, located in the trial judge’s reasons, and emphasized by
    the appellant on appeal, is the very foundation of the fabrication argument at
    trial and on appeal: that the complainants fabricated the allegations only
    after returning to their mother’s home. Given the complainants’
    acknowledgements that they had some difficulty with the truth, including that
    S. had a history of exaggerating and lying and that D. is “gullible … </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[and] easy to play with”</span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, there was also an evidentiary foundation
    for this position. That evidentiary foundation was reinforced by their mother’s
    testimony, acknowledging that, given their fetal alcohol syndrome, the
    complainants were like “sponges” and would sometimes tell lies, as people could
    put words in their mouths. </span></p>

    the depth of the complainants’ mother’s anger over the CAS investigation was
    critical to the defence counsel’s theory regarding a motive to fabricate.
    Without the CAS records, the defence was deprived of the most accurate insight
    into the factual underpinnings motivating that anger. </span></p>

    substantially outweighed by the impact disclosure would have on the complainants’
    rights to privacy and equality.” For the purposes of these reasons, I am

lang=EN-CA>I take no issue with the strong privacy interests contained in the

    legal authorities on this point. In these reasons, I have kept squarely in mind
    the privacy, personal security, and equality of children who come into contact
    with the CAS, many of whom already come from highly marginalized and difficult
    circumstances: <em>Mills</em>, at para. 92; <em>R. v. A.M.</em>, 2008 CanLII
    59561 (Ont. S.C.), at para. 21. As Wein J. noted in <em>A.M.</em>, at para. 21,
    those who come into contact with the CAS are at risk of having their lives
    documented, which places “an already marginalized group at a further
    disadvantage by making them the subject of additional scrutiny”. I agree with
    that important observation, and I endorse the view that CAS records must be
    carefully guarded. Even so, they cannot be guarded at all costs.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Section 278.5(2) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>provides a
    list of many factors to be taken into account when determining whether the trial
    judge should review the third-party records after the issue of likely relevance
    has been determined in the affirmative. While “the nature and extent of the
    reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the record” and “the
    potential prejudice to the personal dignity and right to privacy of any person
    to whom the record relates” are factors under ss. 278.5(2)(c) and (e) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, there are others. For example, s. 278.5(2)(a) requires the judge to
    take into account “the extent to which the record is necessary for the accused
    to make a full answer and defence”. All of these factors and more are to be
    considered when determining whether it is necessary in the interests of justice
    that the “likely relevant” third-party records should be produced to the trial
    judge for review.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As I read my colleague’s decision, at para. 66, the first reason
    given to explain why the appellant’s ability to make full answer and defence
    was outweighed by the complainants’ rights to privacy and equality is that the
    CAS records only had a “relatively low probative value”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The difference between third-party records that are found to be
    “likely relevant”, yet of only “low probative value”, is a nuanced one. I need
    not delve into that distinction because, in my view, the CAS records were not of
    low probative value. To the contrary, and for the reasons already expressed,
    the CAS records stood at the other end of the probity spectrum. The preliminary
    inquiry evidence demonstrated that there was a near certainty that the CAS
    records would contain reliable, independent evidence of what was said to the
    CAS worker, which would stand in opposition to what the complainants would
    testify to at trial. There was also a near certainty that the CAS records would
    contain reliable, independent evidence about the CAS investigation itself,
    something that would further inform the defence counsel’s allegation of a
    motive to fabricate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The second reason given by my colleague, at para. 66 of his reasons,
    to explain why it was unnecessary in the interests of justice for the trial
    judge to review the CAS records is that “the appellant already had what he
    needed to challenge the complainants’ credibility arising from those [CAS]
    interviews <span class=Underline>because the complainants admitted at the
    preliminary inquiry that they had lied to the CAS</span>” (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Respectfully, I do not agree with this reasoning because, in my
    view, it does not grapple with the true relevance of the CAS records. The fact
    that the complainants testified at the preliminary inquiry that they had lied
    to the CAS worker was not relevant to whether there was a “reasonable
    possibility” that the information contained in the CAS records would be
    “logically probative” to an issue at trial: <em>Mills</em>,<i> </i>at para. 45,
    citing<em> O’Connor</em>, at para. 22, <em>per </em>Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J.
    (dissenting, but not on this point). While the complainants’ evidence regarding
    their lies to the CAS worker and their reasons for having lied would no doubt
    weigh heavily in the assessment of their credibility at trial, that evidence
    did not serve to neutralize the probative value of what was very likely to be
    found in the CAS records. To suggest otherwise is the equivalent of saying that
    the complainants should be believed when they say they lied to the CAS worker.
    However, what if they told the truth to the CAS worker and were later lying at
    the preliminary inquiry about having not told the truth? Surely that was an
    issue for the trier of fact to sort out at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This is not a case where the defence was grasping at straws about
    what might be in the CAS records. It is a case where everyone knew that the CAS
    records likely contained references to what the complainants told the CAS
    worker, and that those things would stand as the antithesis to what they would
    testify to at trial. All the defence needed were the actual CAS records, which
    would have provided the most accurate look into the CAS investigation and the
    most precise description of what the complainants actually told the CAS worker. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In short, the defence should not have been required to rely on the
    evidence of the complainants to recount with accuracy the things they said to
    the CAS worker or the circumstances surrounding the CAS investigation, both of
    which went to the very core of the appellant’s defence. This is particularly
    true given that the complainants had an admittedly difficult relationship with
    the truth. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, in my view, the appellant did not already have what he
    needed to challenge the complainants’ credibility because the complainants
    admitted that they had lied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    itself for the purposes of explaining why it was necessary in the interests of
    justice for the trial judge to review the records, it is worthy of mentioning
    that the centrality of the CAS investigation played out exactly as the defence
    counsel said it would at trial. So much so that the only thing missing from the
    trial were the actual CAS records that would have provided the most accurate
    account of the circumstances surrounding the investigation.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Even the trial Crown appreciated the relevance of the CAS
    investigation to the appellant’s defence, asking the complainants questions
    about the following topics:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>How the CAS became involved;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Why they had lied to the CAS worker about the
    conditions of their parental home and of the home of the appellant and his
    wife;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Whom they spoke to at the CAS, the name of the
    CAS worker who interviewed them, and the spelling of her name;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The locations where the interviews with the
    CAS worker took place and who was present at those interviews; and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Why they no longer stayed at the home of the
    appellant and his wife after August 2015, which was the month that coincided
    with the CAS investigation.</span></p>

    appellant and his wife testified at trial, denying having coached the
    complainants to lie to the CAS. They also denied being involved in the
    preparation of S.’s handwritten notes. While the appellant’s wife admitted at
    trial that she took the initial steps to get the CAS involved, she testified
    that she did so in consultation with a lawyer and only because the complainants
    were making so many concerning allegations about their parental home
    environment.</span></p>

    your typical third-party records application. There was nothing collateral or
    peripheral about the CAS investigation or the records recording that
    investigation. Considered in its entire context, and as informed by how the
    trial unfolded, the CAS investigation was central to the appellant’s defence at
    trial. Consistent with how it was argued at the third-party records
    application, the appellant’s defence played through as expected. The only thing
    they did not have were the actual CAS records that would have provided an
    accurate look into what was actually said and what actually happened in that
    CAS investigation. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The respondent argues that if this court finds a reversible error in
    the trial judge’s approach to the third-party records application, then rather
    than sending the matter back to a new trial, this court ought to receive and
    review the CAS records that were filed as a sealed exhibit at trial and conduct
    the second stage of the third-party records analysis. Only after that determination
    is made could this court decide whether a new trial is necessary. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The respondent is proposing that we use this court’s power under s.
    683(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> to order the production of the sealed
    CAS records. While there is some authority for this court to conduct such an
    exercise, I would decline to do so here: see <em>R. v. Bradey</em>, 2015 ONCA
    738, 331 C.C.C. (3d) 511, at paras. 72-74, 104-12.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, the likely relevance of the CAS records is clear in this
    case, as are the interests of justice. The trial judge should have looked at
    the CAS records, and the second stage of the analysis should have unfolded in
    accordance with the statutory scheme. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I have little doubt that, subject to editing, the CAS records would
    have been released, in light of the evidence given at the preliminary inquiry
    and the central focus of the appellant’s defence at trial. Considering the
    entire context of this case, to embark upon the second stage of the analysis at
    this point would only serve to slow the new trial down.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>E.      disposition</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I would set aside the convictions and order a new trial. Presumably,
    if the parties and the Superior Court of Justice were in agreement, the issue
    involving the third-party records could proceed directly to the second stage of
    the analysis at the new trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> The appellant’s Notice of Application sought “all records of the
    [CAS] in relation to [the complainants’ mother] and [the complainants]”. During
    oral submissions at the third-party records application, the defence counsel
    narrowed the application, targeting only the records related to the interviews
    conducted in August 2015 and any follow-up from those interviews. The defence
    counsel acknowledged that if, “by chance”, the CAS records contained reference
    to other involvement with the complainants or their family, that this was not
    something that the defence was seeking to have disclosed.</span></p>
