  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Harvison Young J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>The respondent, Charlesfort,
    is a property developer in Ottawa. Charlesfort purchased a property it intended
    to redevelop for a condominium project. It commenced an action against the
    appellant, the City of Ottawa, for negligent misrepresentation after the City
    failed to accurately inform Charlesfort of the contents of a municipal easement
    in 2004-2005 during the rezoning process. The easement ran along the northern
    edge of the project site’s lot line but was located on an adjacent property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>During the rezoning
    process, Charlesfort believed that the easement contained a trunk sewer. It was
    not until a few years later, during the site plan approval process, that it
    learned that the easement contained a four-foot-wide water main which was old
    and in unknown condition. The water main sat within three or four feet of the northern
    lot line. Millions of gallons of water flowed through the water main every
    hour. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>The nature and location
    of the water main meant that Charlesfort could not excavate and construct its
    underground parking garage right up to the northern lot line as planned. As a
    result, Charlesfort was required to redesign the proposed garage and reduce the
    parking available to purchasers of units, which resulted in significant delays
    in construction and increased costs. Charlesfort claimed that the City negligently
    misrepresented what was in the easement during the rezoning process and that the
    City was liable for Charlesfort’s damages of around $6 million arising from
    increased construction costs, decreased project revenue, and damages associated
    with the delay, among other things. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>The trial judge held that
    the City made negligent misrepresentations to Charlesfort during the rezoning
    process about the contents of the easement. The City owed a duty of care to
    Charlesfort based on their close and direct relationship during the rezoning
    process. The City had implicitly undertaken to take reasonable care to provide
    Charlesfort with accurate information about infrastructure in adjacent property
    that was materially relevant to the proposed redevelopment. The City failed to
    ensure that accurate and complete information was communicated to Charlesfort, and
    Charlesfort reasonably relied on the information it received from the City’s
    planning department. The trial judge awarded damages of around $4.5 million to
    Charlesfort for increased development costs, lost revenue, and lost interest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>The City appeals from
    this judgment. It says that it did not owe a duty of care to Charlesfort. I
    agree. I would allow the appeal for the following reasons.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>Facts</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>In 2004, Charlesfort
    purchased a property it planned to redevelop into the Continental, a
    condominium building. The purchase was conditional on both site remediation and
    the approval of a rezoning application, which was filed in 2003 by a previous
    developer, so that Charlesfort could build a high-rise condominium on the
    property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>The zoning in place at
    the time was a general commercial designation and included setbacks of around
    six to seven metres at the front and rear. The rezoning application sought a
    change of use to a residential designation, changes to permitted height and
    density, and a reduction in the setbacks to allow construction above-grade to
    within one metre of the front of the property and right up to the northern lot
    line in the rear. The application proposed parking on site and included
    drawings of an underground parking garage that would extend from the northern
    to southern lot lines, with no setback. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>The City’s practice at
    the time for rezoning applications was to assign a City planner to prepare a
    summary of the application, which was circulated to interested parties to
    obtain feedback. The interested parties included internal groups, such as the
    Infrastructure Approvals division, and external agencies, such as school boards
    and pipeline companies when the rezoning application involved property within
    200 metres of their pipelines. The City’s planning department passed on any
    comments it received through the circulation process to the applicant. The City
    planner would obtain additional information and assessments from the applicant,
    if necessary, and prepare a staff report which would indicate whether the
    City’s planning department recommended the proposed rezoning. The staff report,
    if approved by senior leadership of the City’s planning department, would be
    discussed at a public meeting of the Planning and Environment Committee (the
    “Planning Committee”). If the Planning Committee voted to approve the
    application, it would go to City Council for a vote.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>The City planner who
    was assigned to Charlesfort’s rezoning application circulated his summary internally
    to the Infrastructure Approvals division and externally in January 2004. He received
    some comments from the Infrastructure Approvals division, which were relevant
    to the site plan stage but did not require Charlesfort to do anything further
    for the rezoning application. He passed these comments on to Charlesfort. Charlesfort
    retained a local planning firm in August 2004 to assist with the rezoning
    application process.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>In the course of the
    rezoning application, the City planner, who was assigned to the file,
    erroneously advised Charlesfort’s planner that the easement contained a trunk
    sewer. Charlesfort’s principal was not aware of the statement at the time. The
    statement was repeated in the staff report, which was considered at a Planning
    Committee meeting on February 22, 2005. At the Planning Committee meeting, a
    representative for the owner of the adjacent property corrected this error,
    advising that the easement in fact contained a water main. Charlesfort’s principal
    and planner were present at the meeting. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>Just prior to the
    Planning Committee meeting, the program manager of the Infrastructure Approvals
    division sent an email to various City engineers about the proposed redevelopment.
    He asked them to recommend a sewer to connect to and to advise whether there
    were any issues with storm and water services at the location. An engineer with
    the water resources group responded by email that there were no special water
    distribution issues related to the site, and he also noted the presence of a
    four-foot transmission main just north of the property. This response was received
    by the Infrastructure Approvals division but was not forwarded to the City’s
    planning department, nor was it forwarded to Charlesfort.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>The rezoning
    application was approved by the Planning Committee, and City Council passed a
    site-specific zoning by-law with respect to the property in March 2005. The
    owner of the adjacent property, where the easement was located, appealed City
    Council’s decision to the Ontario Municipal Board. The parties settled the
    appeal, and the Ontario Municipal Board issued a decision based on the
    settlement, which approved a one-metre above-grade setback from the northern lot
    line. There was no provision for a below-grade setback. In September 2005,
    Charlesfort waived the conditions related to rezoning and site remediation in
    its agreement of purchase and acquired the property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>The next step in the
    development approvals process required Charlesfort to obtain site plan
    approval. In August 2007, Charlesfort applied to the City for site plan
    approval for the Continental. The project included a 15-storey tower with a
    two-storey underground parking garage. Charlesfort expected that construction
    of the Continental would finish by the summer of 2009.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>In October 2007, the
    City’s planning department sent Charlesfort some preliminary comments on its
    site plan approval application. Among other things, the City asked for revised
    drawings showing the water main and the easement. Charlesfort’s principal saw
    this letter but did not immediately understand the implications of the
    reference to the water main. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>Charlesfort was not
    initially alarmed when it was told about the water main in October 2007. It had
    obtained a demolition permit around this time and applied for an excavation
    permit. Meanwhile, the City realized that the water main was very close to the property
    line and would need to be taken into account in the redevelopment of the
    property, particularly the underground parking garage which was planned to
    extend up to the property lot line. There were concerns about the condition of
    the water main given its age and that vibrations from excavation could affect
    its integrity and risk a breach.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>The company that would
    excavate the site for Charlesfort revised its proposed approach for excavation
    to reduce risks, but the City was not willing to permit construction to go
    ahead if the water main could not be turned off. The water main could not be
    shut down for the foreseeable future because the water main had no back up
    while the City was doing maintenance work on its water systems, and the City
    was not sure that the valves that needed to be turned off were functional. Even
    if the water main could be shut down, City engineers had concerns about
    construction right next to the water main, whether there would be sufficient
    access to repair a possible break in the water main if a structure was
    constructed adjacent to it, and whether the easement itself adequately
    protected the water main.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>In July 2008,
    Charlesfort changed its parking garage plans by moving it back from the
    northern lot line to increase the distance between the structure and the water
    main. Charlesfort signed a site plan agreement with the City in September 2008
    and received an excavation permit and site plan approval. The condominium was
    completed in November 2011, around two years later than initially contemplated. </span></p>

    infrastructure and that a water main breach would pose a serious threat to
    health and safety as well as the security of critical infrastructure. In
    addition, she determined that the City did not ask Charlesfort to conduct its
    own investigation of the easement, that the City had information about the size
    of the water main that Charlesfort could not obtain through publicly available

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>To determine

    “expectations, representations, reliance, and the property or other interests

    economic loss arising from negligent misrepresentation or the performance of a
    service, two factors are determinative in the proximity analysis: the
    defendant’s undertaking and the plaintiff’s reliance. A relationship of
    proximity is formed when the defendant undertakes to provide a representation
    or service in circumstances that invite reasonable reliance by the plaintiff, as
    the defendant becomes obligated to take reasonable care and the plaintiff has a
    right to rely on the defendant’s undertaking to do so: <em>Livent</em>, at
    para. 30; <em>Maple Leaf</em>, at para. 32. </span></p>

    on the part of the plaintiff that falls beyond the scope of the defendant’s
    undertaking of responsibility necessarily falls outside the scope of the
    proximate relationship and, therefore, of the defendant’s duty of care: <em>Livent</em>,
    at para. 31. The purpose for which the representation was made or the service
    undertaken is key to the determination of the scope of the duty of care. As the
    court noted, at para. 31:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>By assessing all
    relevant factors arising from the relationship between the parties, the
    proximity analysis not only determines the <span class=Underline>existence</span> of a relationship of proximity, but also delineates the <span class=Underline>scope</span> of the rights and duties which flow from that relationship. In short, it
    furnishes not only a “principled basis upon which to draw the line between
    those to whom the duty is owed and those to whom it is not”, but also a
    principled delineation of the scope of such duty, based upon the purpose for
    which the defendant undertakes responsibility. [Citation omitted. Emphasis in

    other economic loss they sustained when they experienced a shortage of product
    after Maple Leaf Foods recalled meat products due to a listeria outbreak at a
    Maple Leaf Foods factory. The majority began its analysis by noting that the
    franchisees were making claims for pure economic loss, observing that tort law
    has historically been concerned mainly with negligent interference with or
    injury to rights in bodily integrity, mental health and property, which
    explains why the common law has been slow to accord protection to pure economic

    The majority held that there was no proximate relationship between Maple Leaf
    Foods and the Mr. Sub franchisees. The purpose and scope of Maple Leaf Foods’
    undertaking was to ensure that Mr. Sub customers who ate the meats would not become
    ill or die. Properly construed, the undertaking was made to consumers with the
    purpose of reassuring them that their interests were being kept in mind, and
    not made to “commercial intermediaries” such as Mr. Sub or its franchisees. The

    that undertakings are not to be treated as given at large. A court must
    consider whether the undertaking is made to the plaintiff and for what purpose:
    at paras. 35, 38. Further, when a defendant undertakes to do something, they
    assume the task of doing so reasonably, which manifests an <span
class=Underline>intention</span> to induce the plaintiff’s reliance: at para. 33.
    As <em>Maple Leaf</em> explains, at para. 34, it is the “intended effect” of
    the defendant’s undertaking upon the plaintiff’s autonomy that brings the
    defendant into a relationship of proximity:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Where that effect
    works to the plaintiff’s detriment, it is a wrong to the plaintiff. Having <span

    for any economic loss that the plaintiff can show was caused by such reliance.
    The plaintiff’s pre-reliance circumstance has become “an entitlement that runs

    well as the purpose and scope of any such undertaking. These, as <em>Maple Leaf</em> made clear, are critical aspects of the proximity analysis. <em>Maple Leaf</em> emphasized that it is the <span class=Underline>intended effect</span> of the defendant’s

    to have reasonably relied on any such representation. In support of finding
    this implicit undertaking, the trial judge pointed to the City’s obligations
    under statute and other policy instruments, the City’s powers, abilities, and
    access to information during the rezoning process, and the typical practices

    to process the rezoning application and to take the appropriate considerations
    into account in so doing. Any representations made by the City must be
    considered in the context and purpose of the rezoning process in which they
    were made. Even where an undertaking exists, there is a need to consider the
    purpose of the undertaking and whether the plaintiff’s reliance fell within or
    outside the purpose of the defendant’s undertaking of responsibility. These are
    the determinative factors in establishing a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care

    with Maple Leaf Foods such that it could reasonably rely on a representation or
    undertaking made to consumers. This is because the undertaking was made for the

    in being able to build the project as planned. I disagree. The scope and
    purpose of the City’s undertaking to process Charlesfort’s rezoning application

    Law of Planning and Zoning</em>, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters Canada
    Limited, 2021), at s. 4.2. It enables local governments, like municipalities,
    to control the use of land by depriving property owners of certain uses of
    property for the public good. The public interest purpose of zoning does not
    suggest that the City was guaranteeing or had Charlesfort’s economic interests
    in mind when it undertook to process the rezoning application.</span></p>

    scheme and other policy instruments reflect the public interest focus of zoning
    decisions. The <em>Planning Act</em>, which authorizes municipalities to pass
    zoning by-laws, requires that planning officials, in exercising authority that
    affects a planning matter, “have regard to” policy statements issued under s.
    3(1) of the <em>Planning Act</em>. The 1997 Provincial Policy Statement, which
    governed at the time the rezoning took place, identified a number of key
    provincial interests related to land use planning and development. These
    included wise use and protection of Ontario’s resources, protecting the
    long-term health and safety of Ontario’s population, and the financial and
    economic well-being of Ontario and municipalities. The City also had several
    official plans it considered to be relevant, and these official plans included
    objectives and policies such as encouraging denser residential development in
    urban areas, compatibility with existing neighbourhoods, and promoting growth
    that facilitated the use of public transit.</span></p>

    Act</em>, the Provincial Policy Statement, and the City’s official plans that
    land use planning and restrictive zoning target the protection of the public
    and good management of land resources. These are public goals. The trial judge
    identified several issues the City should have been aware of during the rezoning
    process based on these instruments, including risks to public health, safety,
    and critical infrastructure, and adequate parking. These again are public
    interests, concerned with public health, infrastructure that serves the public,
    and ensuring that local traffic flow is not impeded. </span></p>

    Nothing in the legislative framework suggests that the legislature intended

    duty to developers. The observation in <em>Imperial Tobacco</em>, at para. 44,

    purpose of the undertaking in this case also must consider the nature of the
    process. This was a rezoning application. There were still a number of steps
    that the developer had to complete before construction, including the site plan
    approval process, during which the City could impose conditions to an approval,
    and permit approvals. The only goal at the rezoning stage was to determine
    whether a site-specific by-law should be granted as sought by Charlesfort’s
    rezoning application. Even though Charlesfort paid a fee for the rezoning
    application and a site-specific zoning by-law was eventually passed, there is
    no basis in the record to support the inference that the City was intending to
    undertake that the ultimate project would be built or would be as profitable
    for Charlesfort as it had initially anticipated. Such a result could, in
    effect, render municipalities insurers of developers’ profits. It would, in
    other words, create a potentially limitless liability.</span></p>

    nothing that made the relationship between the appellant and the respondent

    investigate what the easement contained during the zoning process. She also
    found that developers applying for site-specific rezoning generally rely on the
    information provided by City planners. While I would not interfere with these
    findings, I would not infer from these factors that the City invited Charlesfort
    to rely on anything beyond the purpose and scope of the rezoning application. </span></p>

    application and anything resulting from the process as assurance about its
    economic interests or that it could proceed with its development as planned.
    Rather, this was done to further the purpose of the City fulfilling its
    statutory obligations and acting in accordance with the public interest.
    Sharing and receiving information as was the City’s practice may be seen to
    increase transparency among various interested parties and allowed the City to
    determine the best way to protect and advance the public interest within the

    underground garage that extended right up to the northern lot line, she found
    that it was foreseeable that if the City failed to inform Charlesfort about a
