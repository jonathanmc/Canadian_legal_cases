  <p class=Onappealfrom><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the conviction entered by
    Justice Alexander D. Kurke of the Superior Court of Justice on February 5, 2019,
    and from the sentence imposed on July 26, 2019, with reasons reported at 2019
    ONSC 40, 370 C.C.C. (3d) 221. </span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault of two young teenagers and
    was sentenced to a prison term totaling 8.5 years. He appeals from conviction
    and seeks leave to appeal from sentence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each of the complainants described a course of sexual assaults upon
    them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant P.T., then thirteen years old, asked the appellant if he
    could live in his apartment. The appellant agreed and did not demand rent from
    the complainant. The appellant admittedly supplied PT with alcohol and drugs. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the complainant,<span lang=EN-CA> the appellant climbed
    into P.T.’s bed behind P.T. and held and squeezed P.T.’s penis through his
    underwear, and humped his crotch into P.T.’s buttocks</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second incident involved similar touching
    and circumstances. While P.T. had slept, the appellant had positioned himself
    on the floor beside the bed, low enough down the side of the bed so that his
    hand could reach P.T.’s penis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>P.T. left the apartment after this last
    incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the complainant W.V., the incidents
    took place in the V. family home, in the City of Greater Sudbury, from
    1999-2001. At that time, W.V.’s parents had to make frequent trips to Toronto
    to deal with a sibling who was gravely ill, and the appellant was permitted to
    stay at the family home. The appellant was entrusted to help W.V who was, at
    that time, fifteen years old. Various people may have been in the home when the
    incidents occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On each of the many incidents in question,
    before sleeping, W.V. had been consuming drugs and alcohol provided to him by
    the appellant or with the encouragement of the appellant</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first occasion of sexual touching of W.V. by
    the appellant took place on the rec room floor, where W.V. had either passed
    out or fallen asleep from the consumption of drugs and alcohol. W.V. awoke to
    find a hand down the front of his pants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On numerous occasions, the appellant took
    advantage of W.V.’s unconsciousness or sleep to masturbate W.V., including to
    the point of ejaculation. W.V. would awaken to find that this conduct by the appellant
    was occurring. On two occasions, W.V. was asleep or unconscious in his room
    when the appellant penetrated W.V.’s anus with his penis. The appellant guided
    W.V. into accessible positions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The assaults of W.V. ended when the appellant left
    the home, and no longer had access to W.V.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence at trial was that the incidents
    never happened, and that the complainants’ evidence was unreliable and not
    credible.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified, but the trial judge
    rejected his evidence as evasive, self-serving, and contrary to common sense
    and reason. The trial judge applied </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. W.(D.)</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>[1991] 1
    S.C.R. 742,</span><span lang=EN-CA> and convicted the appellant on both counts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, acting in person, pointed the
    court to various aspects of the evidence. These do not establish any reversible
    error on the part of the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Duty counsel, on behalf of the appellant, argues
    that the trial judge made an error of law that requires this court to set aside
    the convictions and order a new trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In relation to W.V., duty counsel points to the trial
    judge’s credibility assessment. First, at para. 147, the trial judge noted “WV
    could have exaggerated or minimized what he recollected, but did not do so”
    before giving several examples. Second, at para. 153, the trial judge noted
    that there were “undeniable frailties relating to the reliability of the evidence
    of WV”, but that candour and lack of exaggeration “speak highly of his
    credibility”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel argues that this kind of reasoning
    reflects an error in principle, relying on </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v.
    Alisaleh</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, </span><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>2020 ONCA 597</span><span lang=EN-CA>, paras. 13-17. In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Alisaleh</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, this court observed,
    at para. 16, that: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[I]t is not an
    error to simply note that there is an absence of embellishment in the
    complainant’s testimony. This court has held that the presence of embellishment
    can be a basis to find the complainant incredible, and there is nothing wrong
    with noting the absence of something that could have diminished credibility.
    However, </span><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>it is wrong to reason
    that because an allegation could have been worse, it is more likely to be true</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel submits that the same problem affects
    the trial judge’s reasoning in respect of the first complainant, P.T. At para. 133,
    the trial judge points to P.T.’s criminal record, but nevertheless finds him a
    compelling witness, noting the lack of exaggeration. The trial judge returns to
    this theme at para. 135. Counsel submits that the trial judge erred in using
    lack of exaggeration as a “makeweight in favour of credibility”, contrary to
    this court’s instruction in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Kiss</span></em><span

    better if the trial judge had avoided any reference to a lack of exaggeration,
    this court noted in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Kiss</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> that it is not an error to note the absence of something that could
    diminish credibility. The crucial question is whether the trial judge reasoned
    that because the allegation was not worse, it was likely to be true: see </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Kiss</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, para. 52; </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Alisaleh</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, at para. 16.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is clear from the trial judge’s reasons that
    he engaged in a detailed and thorough review of the evidence of both complainants.
    Reading the reasons as a whole, we would interpret the impugned passages as
    references to an absence of a matter that would diminish W.V. or P.T.’s credibility.
    We agree with the Crown that when the trial judge indicated that the
    complainant W.V. did not exaggerate, he meant that the complainant was ready to
    acknowledge the limits of his memory. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As to sentence, there is no basis to intervene. The
    appellant was around forty years old when he befriended the vulnerable young
    complainants. He fed them drugs and alcohol to facilitate the commission of the
    offences. There was an element of breach of trust in relation to both.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The assaults have had serious negative
    consequences for the well-being of both complainants. The seven-years-and-six-months
    imprisonment for the sexual assault upon W.V. and the one-year consecutive sentence
    for the sexual assault of P.T. were within the range established by the
    jurisprudence and there is no basis to intervene. Leave to appeal sentence is
    granted but the appeals from sentence are dismissed.</span></p>
