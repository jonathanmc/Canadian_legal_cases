    was a student at a university in Detroit but was living in Toronto for the
    summer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The accused and the complainant met briefly
    about a year before the incident giving rise to these appeals, when the
    complainant went to a party the accused was hosting at his condominium. They
    did not see each other again until the night in question. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the evening of May 12, 2016, the complainant
    and the accused ran into each other at a bar in Toronto where the complainant
    was celebrating her birthday. The accused approached the complainant and said
    that he recognized her. They started talking and he invited the complainant to
    his mother’s nearby condominium (a different condominium than where they first
    met). They walked there together, were kissing, and quickly moved to the
    bedroom where the complainant undressed, with the help of the accused.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified that the accused pushed
    her head to his groin, forcing her to perform oral sex on him, after which he began
    to penetrate her vagina, to which she repeatedly said “no”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The accused testified that the complainant
    initiated the oral sex. He denied forcing her head and said that the oral sex
    was consensual. He said he then asked her if she wanted him to get a condom, she
    did not reply, and they continued kissing. The accused maintains that no
    intercourse occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both agree that the accused was on top of the
    complainant when she told him she was going to be sick. He allowed her to get
    up and go to the bathroom where she began throwing up into the toilet.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified that while she was naked
    and had her head “pretty much buried” in the toilet, she heard a chiming sound
    that she knew signalled a FaceTime call. She had owned an iPhone for several
    years and knew what FaceTime was and what the FaceTime chime sounds like. She looked
    up and saw the accused pointing his cellphone at her and heard someone talking
    on the other end of the call. She heard the accused say something to the effect
    of “look at this” and understood, from the conversation between the accused and
    the others on the call, that they were making fun of her. She also heard laughing
    on both ends of the call. She felt scared by what had just happened and “even
    more scared” because others could see her in the bathroom, naked and vomiting, and
    she knew they could take a screenshot or record what was happening. She said, “with
    the internet nowadays, like anyone could see that.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant heard the accused walk away and
    then she heard another FaceTime chime. The accused returned to the bathroom and
    had another FaceTime call while pointing his cellphone at her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The accused’s cell phone records were entered as
    exhibits at trial. Those records showed that three FaceTime calls were made on his
    cell phone between 12:54 a.m. and 1:01 a.m. on May 13, 2016. All three calls
    were made to friends of the accused. The first call lasted 1 minute and 36
    seconds; the second call lasted 0 seconds; and the third call lasted 5 minutes
    and 17 seconds. The accused testified that he called three of his friends in
    the United States to get their advice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Unit of the Toronto Police Service, one of the investigating officers,
    testified at trial. He explained that he was familiar with iPhones, has had an
    iPhone since they were first released, and was familiar with the FaceTime
    application. He was not qualified as an expert before giving his evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>DC Angus had examined the accused’s cell phone
    and extracted some data from it. He first explained how an extraction report
    sorts FaceTime calls. He then explained the FaceTime application itself. He
    described FaceTime as a video-calling platform or video messaging, and that those
    engaged in the FaceTime call see one another. He said, “so, much like a phone
    call, it’s like a video phone call.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>DC Angus also explained how the cameras on the
    phones are used in a FaceTime application.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>So every iPhone has front and back cameras. So
    when you are in the FaceTime application, you can choose which camera video
    feed you’re sending to the other person. So you can pick the selfie camera […]
    so the person on the other end can see you and you can see them on the screen.
    Or you can choose the back camera, so they can see whatever you are pointing your
    phone at and you can still see the person you are communicating with.  </span></p>

    defence objections to the Crown closing. Each of the rulings is discussed
    below.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>A. The Directed Verdict of Acquittal on the
    s. 162.1 Charge</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>          1.       </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>The Parties’ Positions at Trial</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After the Crown closed its case, defence counsel
    brought an application for a directed verdict on the s. 162.1 count. He asserted
    that for the Crown to obtain a conviction under s. 162.1, the Crown had to show
    that the accused (1) knowingly disseminated (2) an intimate image of a person (3)
    while knowing or being reckless as to whether that person gave their consent to
    the dissemination. He argued that the Crown could not meet its burden on the
    second point – the existence of an intimate image. He contended that a
    successful prosecution required proof that the image was a “recording” and that
    the common meaning of recording is something that has “been committed to a form
    where it can be reviewed, referred to or reproduced at a later time, something
    with a degree of permanence”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown argued that “recording” must be read
    in the context of the harm that s. 162.1 was enacted to address: sexual exploitation
    committed through technology, including cyberbullying and revenge porn. It
    maintained that this harm occurs when an image of an intimate moment is shared
    without the complainant’s consent and that the recipient’s inability to further
    share or preserve the moment does not negate the harm or diminish the sender’s
    culpability. Moreover, the Crown argued, there was sufficient evidence that
    FaceTime calls were capable of reproduction because the complainant testified
    that recipients of the FaceTime call could have taken a screenshot of the call.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>2.       </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>The Trial Judge’s Ruling</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge gave the following reasons for
    allowing the application and directing a verdict of acquittal on the s. 162.1
    count.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue on the application was whether a FaceTime
    call amounts to a “visual recording” as set out in s. 162.1(2). The trial judge
    said that the “ordinary common-sense definition” of visual recording is “any
    image captured on any device, electronic or otherwise, that has the capability
    for reproduction”. While there was no dispute that a FaceTime call is “visual”,
    the trial judge stated that she had difficulty “with the absence of evidence regarding
    the recording component”. She listed the three sources of evidence on that
    matter: that of the complainant; the accused’s cell phone records which showed that
    he made three FaceTime calls on his cellphone “at a time closely connected to
    the allegations”; and, the evidence of DC Angus.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge described the complainant’s
    testimony as follows: she saw the accused pointing a cellphone at her while she
    was naked and vomiting into the toilet in his bathroom; she heard laughing and
    someone other than the accused speaking; and she heard a chiming sound that she
    associated with a FaceTime call.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge summarized DC Angus’s evidence
    as: FaceTime is a video-calling platform; each person’s phone has a camera; and
    the sender and recipient can see each other on video. She noted his description
    of FaceTime as a “video phone call” and his view that using FaceTime is as easy
    as making a traditional phone call. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The judge then stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The only evidence I have available to me is
    that a FaceTime call is identical to a phone call with the added component of
    an image. A phone call is a live real-time auditory transmission to another
    person. It is not a recording. A FaceTime call is also a live real-time
    transmission to another person, with both an auditory and a visual component.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge added that “it may be” that a
    FaceTime call possesses additional features in its transmission or in the
    capturing of images that would amount to a recording, but that evidence was not
    before her. She stated that she was “not prepared to take judicial notice of the
    technical workings and application of a FaceTime call”. She concluded that the deficiency
    in the evidence was a fatal flaw and that a directed verdict had to follow.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her statement to the police, the complainant
    said that the accused had sex with her without her consent. She did not tell
    the police that she was forced to perform oral sex. She mentioned the oral sex
    for the first time during cross-examination at the preliminary inquiry. During that
    cross-examination, the complainant said that “other things” happened that
    night. When asked if she was referring to other sexual acts, she responded
    “just sex then. Yeah, penetration.” A short time later, defence counsel asked
    again about her statement that “other things” had happened. In the series of
    questions that followed, the complainant said that she was “forced to go down
    on” the accused – “like my head kind of being grabbed and pushed and that’s
    where I was kind of like – and yeah, but I didn’t say ‘no’ at that point”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, defence counsel cross-examined the
    complainant on her failure to mention the oral sex in her police interview. In his
    cross-examination, he put parts of the preliminary inquiry transcripts to her.
    She explained that she had not mentioned the oral sex earlier because she was
    uncomfortable talking about sexual acts in a courtroom and it was hard for her
    to think about what happened. She also said she thought she should focus on the
    acts to which she explicitly said “no” and testified that only later did she
    realise that she did not have to say “no” out loud for an act to constitute
    sexual assault. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both defence counsel and the trial Crown
    referred to the complainant’s evidence at the preliminary inquiry in their
    closing submissions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his closing submissions, defence counsel
    reviewed the parts of the preliminary inquiry transcript that he had put to the
    complainant in cross-examination and argued that her answers and her late
    disclosure of the oral sex demonstrated that she could not be trusted. He described
    her answers as “profoundly dishonest” and her explanation for the inconsistency
    as “self-serving”. He argued that the complainant’s late disclosure of the oral
    sex was a sign that her evidence at trial could not be trusted. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial Crown objected to the defence
    counsel’s emphasis on the preliminary inquiry transcripts in his closing
    submissions. She stated that the preliminary inquiry transcripts were not
    evidence and said that they had not been read in chronological order. She also said
    that defence counsel had added tone and emphasis to which the transcript could
    not speak. She asked the trial judge for an instruction on the tone and
    intonation that defence counsel had added to his reading of the preliminary
    inquiry transcripts. The trial judge replied that the Crown could make that
    argument before the jury. Defence counsel did not object.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her closing submissions, the trial Crown
    urged the jury not to place undue weight on the complainant’s evidence at the
    preliminary inquiry. She acknowledged that the complainant had failed to
    mention the oral sex until her cross-examination at the preliminary inquiry but
    argued that the circumstances of the complainant’s disclosure were
    understandable and did not undermine her credibility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial Crown then said the following.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Now, I want to go to the inconsistency that my
    friend raises about oral sex in the prelim transcripts. You have to be very
    careful about that material.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>First of all, [the complainant] testified in
    front of you, and you could look at her demeanour, she testified that that was
    one answer at the preliminary inquiry that was taken out of context.  She had
    already alluded to the other sexual act earlier in her testimony. She explained
    she was alluding to it when she stated “No, no, never mind. It was just
    penetration.” Again, while that might not have been the most eloquent account
    or her account might not have flowed seamlessly that’s not a signifier of
    deceit. Instead, as she explained to you, it’s a reflection of the reality of
    recounting a highly personal sexual trauma in a courtroom setting. <u>Plus, my
    friend has read you the – parts of the transcript, not in chronological order,
    and that testimony is not evidence before you.</u><b> </b>It is incomplete. He
    adds his own tone. We all add tone to things. That gives it character. He’s
    adding that to the transcript.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>You cannot tell – this is why we don’t rely on
    transcript – on prelim transcripts as evidence.  You cannot tell her demeanour
    when she is giving that evidence. You don’t know if she’s crying when she’s
    saying that. You don’t know if she’s breaking down when she’s saying that. You
    don’t know if she’s completely disassociated because you didn’t see her testify
    at the prelim. You did not see her testify for the first time. So, nuanced
    pauses, crying, is lost when my friend reads in prelim transcripts with his own
    tone.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel objected to two aspects of the
    trial Crown closing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>          2.       <em>Defence
    Counsel’s First Objection</em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel’s first objection was to that
    part of trial Crown’s closing submission in which she said that, in his closing
    submission, he had read parts of the transcript “not in chronological order”
    (the “First Impugned Comment”). He said that the First Impugned Comment left
    the jury with the impression that he had not gone through the preliminary
    inquiry transcripts in chronological order when he had. He argued that this gave
    the jury the impression that he was “somehow deceiving them”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge said that, on her reading of the
    preliminary inquiry transcript, there was an issue with the chronology and that,
    while he was entitled to use the transcript in asking the complainant
    questions, she did not think she could say his use of it was “absolutely in
    chronological order”. She said she thought defence counsel used it “topically”
    in chronological order but that was not necessarily how the preliminary inquiry
    transcript read. Defence counsel agreed that in cross-examination he jumped “back
    and forth” in questioning and it was not chronological. (In fact, he was
    mistaken on this point because he did put the preliminary inquiry transcripts
    to the complainant in chronological order.)  But, he argued, when he went
    through the preliminary inquiry transcript in his closing submissions, he did
    so in chronological order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge concluded that it would be
    unfair to tell the jury that defence counsel read excerpts from the preliminary
    inquiry transcript in chronological order without also telling the jury that
    the excerpts had not been put to the complainant in chronological order. She described
    the First Impugned Comment as “an incredibly minor point”. She also stated that:
    “diving into [the First Impugned Comment] would only serve to distract the
    jury”; she did not find that the First Impugned Comment negatively reflected on
    defence counsel; and she wasn’t sure that it required a correction. If a
    correction was needed, the trial judge said that it had to be balanced, with a
    focus on the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge ruled on the First Impugned
    Comment, saying:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I have thought about your request to add an
    instruction to the jury to correct what you believe was an inappropriate
    comment by the Crown when she suggested to the jury that the prelim evidence
    was not in chronological order. I'm of the view that if I instruct the jury in
    that way, that it would also necessitate then a comment on your
    cross-examination of the complainant and indicate to them, that that was not in
    chronological order, despite the fact that what was read to them, which is not
    evidence, was in chronological order. But my understanding is you don't want
    that charge put to them. </span></p>

    the Crown’s comments about the complainant’s emotional state when testifying at
    the preliminary inquiry (the “Second Impugned Comment”). He acknowledged that
    the Crown was “on good footing” when she said that a witness’ demeanour is lost
    when you look at the preliminary inquiry transcripts but said she went too far
    when she said “the crying was lost” because there was no evidence that the
    complainant had been crying.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I think you take it out of context, because what
    I recall of the Crown's closing was that that was in a context of you don't
    know what the demeanour was. You don't know if there was crying. You don't know
    if there were pauses, you don't know. So I don't think it was just, look, she
    was crying and you didn't hear it. That's not the takeaway that I took. […] I
    think if you cherry pick it out of the totality of her submissions, yes, but I
    think you can't do that. I think you have to look at the context in which it
    was given, and it was given in this whole section of here's what you don't

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown makes two overriding submissions on
    this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the Crown says that the trial judge erred
    in law by interpreting “recording” in s. 162.1(2) as requiring proof that the
    image captured by the device is capable of reproduction. Based on the text of
    s. 162.1, it argues that “recording” should be interpreted as any visual
    display created by any means. It says that s. 162.1 was enacted to modernize
    the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>and criminalize sexual exploitation committed
    through technology. Further, it says that Parliament carefully circumscribed
    the parameters of the offence in s. 162.1(2)(a)-(c) based on that purpose: to
    make it criminal to share, by any means, an image without the subject’s
    consent, if that image is sexually explicit and engages the subject’s
    reasonable expectation of privacy. It contends that it is the content of the
    image that matters, not the medium used to share the image. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the Crown submits that the trial judge
    erred in finding that there was no evidence on how an iPhone works. It says
    that, contrary to the trial judge’s view, the evidence of the complainant and
    DC Angus was sufficient and there was no need for the Crown to call expert
    evidence about how iPhones or FaceTime work, or to prove that the FaceTime images
    were capable of reproduction.  </span></p>

    “recording” implies the creation of an image that can be stored, viewed later, and
    reproduced. This, he contends, excludes “evanescent” images that are
    transmitted and viewed a single time and are thereafter unavailable. He
    contends that to record something is to capture an event that happens at a
    point in time and to preserve it in a more lasting form. He argues that the
    Crown’s interpretation of recording sidesteps its essential meaning which is
    that an event is preserved and available for later viewing. He points to the
    trial judge’s comparison of a FaceTime call with a phone call to illustrate this,
    and says that no one thinks of a phone call as a “recording”.</span></p>

    court states that ordinary meaning “refers to the reader’s first impression
    meaning, the understanding that spontaneously comes to mind when words are read
    in their immediate context” and is “the natural meaning which appears when the
    provision is simply read through”. In other words, the “plain” or “ordinary”
    meaning of a word is not dictated by its dictionary meaning nor is it frozen in
    time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>What, then, is the ordinary meaning of the text
    of ss. 162.1(1) and (2)? Section 162.1(1) makes it an offence for a person to knowingly
    disseminate an “intimate image” of a person without their consent. Section
    162.1(2) provides that “intimate image” means a “visual recording of a person
    made by any means including a photographic, film or video recording”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On a plain reading of ss. 162.1(1) and (2), it
    appears to me that the non-consensual visual sharing of an intimate image is
    prohibited – regardless of whether the intimate image being shared has the “capability
    of reproduction”. Further, the natural or ordinary meaning of “visual recording”
    includes a FaceTime call.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>My plain reading of these provisions begins with
    the observation that with traditional technology, such as a camera, the capture
    and display of the visual image are separate acts. But, with a livestream
    application such as FaceTime, the two are simultaneous. Livestream transmissions
    enable a caller to capture visuals (i.e. record intimate images) and share them
    simultaneously. Thus, a FaceTime call in which the caller’s iPhone is pointed
    at a person is a visual recording of that person, within the meaning of s.
    162.1(2), because that person’s image is captured on the caller’s phone and transmitted
    to the recipient’s screen where it is displayed. How could the recipient
    observe the person if that person’s image had not been recorded and transmitted
    to them? It matters not whether the recipient reproduces the person’s image or
    could reproduce it; the recipient has seen the person’s image because the caller
    recorded it and sent it to them. Thus, the FaceTime call is the visual recording
    of the person.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In times gone by, the word “recording” may have
    been confined to visuals that could be reproduced and viewed at a later time or
    place. Photographs and videotapes are examples of that. However, five
    considerations militate against such a restrictive interpretation of
    “recording” in s. 162.1(2).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the language of s. 162.1 is intentionally
    broad. Section 162.1(1) prohibits a wide range of conduct, both overt acts of
    dissemination (i.e. publishes, distributes, transmits, sells) and the
    facilitation of acts of dissemination (makes available or advertises). And, s.
    162.1(2) provides that a visual recording of a person can be “made by any means”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, FaceTime calls are directly caught by
    the language of s. 162.1(2), in which “intimate image” is defined to mean “a <u>visual
    recording</u> … including … a <u>video recording</u>” (emphasis added). As I
    have just explained, in a FaceTime call where the caller focuses the camera in
    their iPhone on a person, the caller is transmitting a video recording of that
    person to the recipient of the call.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, there is nothing in s. 162.1 to suggest
    that the intimate image being shared must be capable of reproduction. The harm
    is in the non-consensual sharing of an intimate image – regardless of whether
    the recipient of the recording (call) reproduces it or can reproduce it. Even
    if there are no copies and no opportunity to make them, as the sentencing court
    observed in <em>R. v. J.B.</em>, 2018 ONSC<i> </i>4726, at para. 44, the act of
    sharing the images in the first place is an attack on the victim’s privacy,
    basic human dignity, and sense of self-worth.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fourth, restricting the meaning of “recording” to
    outdated technology – by requiring that it be capable of reproduction – would
    fail to respond to the ways in which modern technology permits sexual
    exploitation through the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. In so doing,
    it would undermine the objects of s. 162.1 and the intention of Parliament in
    enacting it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 162.1 is a relatively new offence. It came
    into effect as part of Bill c-13, </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Protecting
    Canadians from Online Crime</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, enacted in 2014 and proclaimed
    into force on March 9, 2015. The bill – part of the federal government’s
    initiative against cyber-bullying – was introduced when two young women tragically
    took their lives after intimate images of them had been shared online without
    their consent. These cases and others highlighted the growing trend to use
    technology as a tool of harassment and sexual exploitation, and the justice
    system’s inability to respond because no offence existed at that time which addressed
    that type of conduct.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    autonomy and sexual integrity of the person: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v.
    Jarvis</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2019 SCC 10, at para. 122. Giving “visual
    recording” a </span><span lang=EN-CA>broad and inclusive</span><span
lang=EN-CA> interpretation best accords with the objects of s. 162.1 and Parliament’s
    intention in enacting it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, I accept the Crown’s submission that
    the trial judge’s interpretation of s. 162.1 would base culpability on the medium
    used to share the intimate image, rather than on whether the conduct breached
    the victim’s sexual integrity and privacy. This, it submits, would lead to
    arbitrary and unreasonable distinctions. I agree. The following example
    demonstrates this. </span><span lang=EN-CA>A person who takes a picture of a
    naked woman in a changeroom and gives the photo to one friend would be guilty
    of an offence under s. 162.1. However, if that person livestreamed the image of
    the woman on a website where it can be viewed an indefinite number of times by
    an indefinite number of people but never saved, on the trial judge’s
    interpretation, the person would not be guilty of an offence under s. 162.1.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In conclusion, applying the modern principles of
    statutory interpretation, ss. 162.1(1) and (2) make it an offence to knowingly
    publish, distribute, transmit, sell, make available or advertise an intimate
    image of a person, without the person’s consent. Intimate image means a “visual
    recording” of a person “made by any means”. Interpreting “visual recording” broadly
    and in a common-sense and purposive manner, prohibits the non-consensual visual
    sharing of an image, if the image is sexually explicit and engages the
    subject’s reasonable expectation of privacy. The ordinary meaning of “visual recording”
    does not require proof that the intimate image that was shared is capable of
    reproduction. Thus, a FaceTime call is captured by s. 162.1.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In reaching this conclusion, I reject my
    colleague’s analysis based on the voyeurism offence in s. 162 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. He suggests that the
    accused could have been held answerable under that provision. I disagree.
    Section 162 applies when one person “surreptitiously” observes or makes a
    visual recording of another, in certain circumstances. There is nothing surreptitious
    about the accused’s alleged act of livestreaming images of the complainant as
    she vomited into a toilet, while naked. She was fully aware that the accused
    was pointing his iPhone at her and making a FaceTime call. She was simply too
    ill at the time to be able to leave the toilet. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I respond also to my colleague’s suggestion that
    we are to infer, based on the wording of s. 162, that Parliament used the word
    “recording” in s. 162.1(2) with the deliberate intention of excluding
    livestreaming. There is no basis for such an inference. First, Parliament would
    have no discernible purpose for excluding livestreaming from the offence.
    Second, this suggestion fails to consider the word “recording” within the
    context of each of the two provisions. In s. 162, the offence is the
    surreptitious observation or visual recording of a person in certain
    circumstances. In s. 162.1, the offence is the non-consensual sharing of an
    intimate image, where intimate image means a visual recording of a person made
    by any means. It is a false dichotomy to suggest that because Parliament
    provides two methods of committing the offence in s. 162, it could not have
    intended that the digital recording of an intimate image through a FaceTime
    transmission was a visual recording for the purposes of s. 162.1. As I explain
    above, a FaceTime call falls within the meaning of “visual recording” in s.
    162.1(2). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>2.       </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Sufficiency of the Evidence</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge said that there was “an absence
    of evidence” before her about how a FaceTime call captures images that would
    amount to a “recording” within the meaning of s. 162.1(2). She also stated that
    “despite the ubiquitous nature of iPhones” she was “not prepared to take
    judicial notice about the technical workings and application of a FaceTime call”.
    I do not agree with either statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was evidence before the trial judge about
    how a FaceTime call works. Both the complainant and DC Angus gave evidence on
    this. They indicated that a FaceTime call allows a person to film their
    surroundings and transmit those images, instantaneously, to the recipients of
    the FaceTime call, who are then able to view the images. I would add that DC
    Angus did not testify, as the trial judge indicated, that a FaceTime call is
    “identical” to a telephone call except that it has a visual component, as well
    as an auditory one. He did make the comment that a FaceTime call is “like a
    phone call” with a video component. However, he made that comment in the
    context of explaining the ease with which FaceTime calls can be made. In his
    testimony, DC Angus was very clear that, in a FaceTime call, the caller can
    choose to show the recipient whatever the caller points their back camera at.
    Self-evidently, the ability to show others what is going on around you makes a
    FaceTime call significantly different than a telephone call.    </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no need for additional evidence and
    certainly not that of experts. In saying this, I rely on </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Mohan</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, at pp.
    23-24, in which the Supreme Court explains the necessity pre-condition for the
    admission of expert evidence. The Court said that expert evidence is necessary
    when it provides information likely to be outside the experience and knowledge
    of a judge or jury and that information is needed to enable the trier of fact
    to appreciate the matters in issue due to their technical nature. In short, as
    the Court stated, expert evidence is necessary on matters “ordinary people are
    unlikely to form a correct judgment about, if unassisted by persons with
    specialized knowledge”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The general functioning of iPhones today is not
    the stuff of experts. iPhone users can explain what applications are and what
    use they make of them. And the triers of fact do not need the assistance of persons
    with specialized knowledge in order to form correct judgments on matters
    relating to video messaging applications such as FaceTime. The fact that
    FaceTime sends and receives video images is uncontroversial. So, too, is the capability
    of the recipient of a FaceTime call to take and print out a screen shot: see,
    for example, </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Sylvestre v. Sylvestre</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, 2018 SKQB 105, at para. 16. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The only question in this case was whether there
    was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the accused, in one or more
    of the FaceTime calls, made available to the recipient of the call or calls,
    the image of the complainant while she was naked and vomiting in the toilet. In
    my view, there was and the matter should have gone to the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    counsel’s closing submissions in a jury trial:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>1.</span><span lang=EN-CA> the Crown is entitled to advance its case
    forcefully but, in doing so, must eschew inflammatory rhetoric, demeaning
    commentary, sarcasm, and legally impermissible submissions that undermine trial
    fairness;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, when complaints are made that the
    Crown’s closing submissions exceeded permissible limits, the critical issue is
    whether what was said deprived the accused of a fair trial. To determine this
    issue, an appellate court must consider the impugned comments in the milieu in
    which they were said and the context of the entire trial, as well as any
    judicial response to them: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Manasseri</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at para. 106.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>         2.       <em>The
    First Impugned Comment</em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before placing the First Impugned Comment in
    context, I note that any inaccuracy in it was entirely inadvertent on the part
    of the Crown. This can be seen by considering the exchange between the trial
    judge and defence counsel after he objected to the First Impugned Comment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> In the “to and fro” following defence counsel’s
    objection, the trial judge said that defence counsel had put the preliminary
    inquiry transcripts to the complainant out of order (as he was entitled to).
    Defence counsel agreed, saying he had jumped “back and forth” in his
    cross-examination. As it turned out, defence counsel had put the transcripts to
    the complainant in chronological order and he also read the parts of the preliminary
    inquiry transcript in chronological order in his closing submissions. However,
    when the trial judge made her ruling on the First Impugned Comment, it was on
    the mistaken understanding – shared by defence counsel – that, during
    cross-examination, he put the preliminary inquiry transcript to the complainant
    out of order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With that shared misunderstanding in mind, the
    trial judge ruled that if she were to give a corrective instruction to the jury
    and tell them that defence counsel had read from the preliminary inquiry
    transcript in chronological order, she would also tell the jury that those
    transcripts had not been put to the complainant in chronological order. As the trial
    judge explained, she felt such an instruction was necessary for it to be
    balanced and to keep the jury focussed on the evidence. Defence counsel
    resisted that qualification in the proposed corrective instruction. Consequently,
    the trial judge did not give the correcting instruction. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is important to also consider the First Impugned
    Comment in context. Both defence counsel and the trial Crown referred to the
    complainant’s evidence at the preliminary inquiry in their closing submissions.
    Defence counsel reviewed the parts of the preliminary inquiry transcript that
    had been put to the complainant in cross-examination and described her answers
    as “profoundly dishonest” and her explanation for the inconsistency as “self-serving”.
    He argued that the complainant’s late disclosure of the oral sex was a sign
    that her evidence at trial could not be trusted. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her closing submissions, the trial Crown
    urged the jury not to place undue weight on the complainant’s evidence at the
    preliminary inquiry. She acknowledged that the complainant had failed to
    mention the oral sex until her cross-examination at the preliminary inquiry but
    argued the circumstances of the complainant’s disclosure were understandable
    and did not undermine her credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is within this context that the trial judge found
    the First Impugned Comment to be “an incredibly minor point”. In her view, “diving
    into it would only serve to distract the jury”. Further, she stated, the First
    Impugned Comment did not negatively reflect on defence counsel and did not
    warrant a correcting instruction. I agree with the trial judge on all these
    points.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The First Impugned Comment was not inflammatory
    or demeaning, and caused no prejudice to the accused. It was a minor factual
    inaccuracy made within the context of a valid point: that excerpts from a
    transcript do not tell a complete story and that what mattered was the
    complainant’s explanation of the inconsistency at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>         3.       <em>The
    Second Impugned Comment</em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge dismissed the defence objection
    to the Second Impugned Comment on the basis that defence counsel had “cherry
    picked” it from the Crown’s closing. The trial judge, having heard both defence
    counsel’s closing and that of the trial Crown, understood the Second Impugned Comment
    to simply be part of the Crown’s reminder to the jury that it had heard and
    seen the complainant give her testimony at trial but not at the preliminary
    inquiry and that the jury did not know what the complainant’s emotional state
    had been at the preliminary inquiry. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I accept the trial judge’s determination of this matter.  As the
    Supreme Court stated in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Rose</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262, at para. 126<i>, </i>the trial judge is in
    the best position to assess the significance of the remarks of counsel, to
    determine if they need to be corrected and, if necessary, to correct
    inaccuracies and remedy any unfairness that may arise from the addresses of
    counsel. The trial judge did not see the trial Crown’s reference to the fact
    that the complainant might have been crying or breaking down at the preliminary
    inquiry as an invitation to the jury to speculate about the complainant’s
    demeanour. Rather, she viewed it as part of explaining the inability of a
    transcript to convey the complainant’s emotional state when testifying at the
    preliminary inquiry.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There was nothing wrong with the Crown reminding the jury that nuances
    and emotion are lost when considering transcripts. With transcripts, the trier
    of fact is unable to assess the witness’s demeanour when testifying and is
    therefore “left without the potentially important insights that the ability to
    observe the witness when testifying can afford to a fact finder in the
    assessment of that witness’s credibility”: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v.
    Rowe</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA>, </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>2011 ONCA
    753, 281 C.C.C. (3d) 42, at para. 43. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This is not a case like </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Iyeke</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, 2016 ONCA 349, where the misstatement was the centerpiece of the
    Crown’s closing address. In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Iyeke</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, the accused was charged with possession of a firearm. The Crown
    told the jury in its closing submissions that a confidential informant had told
    police that the accused had a gun. The statement was wrong. In allowing the
    appeal, this court noted that the confidential tip was the “centerpiece” of the
    Crown’s closing address and repeatedly emphasized by the Crown as a powerful
    piece of incriminating evidence. In the present case, the Second Impugned Comment
    was nothing close to being the centerpiece of the Crown’s closing submission:
    Crown counsel mentioned it only once and then only briefly. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I would add that a contextual consideration of the Second Impugned Comment
    must include that, after the defence closing, Crown counsel asked the trial
    judge for a corrective instruction on the tone that defence counsel had added
    when reading the extracts from the preliminary inquiry transcripts. The trial
    judge replied that the Crown could make that argument before the jury and,
    significantly, defence counsel did not object. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I would dismiss this ground of appeal. To the extent that the Second
    Impugned Comment may have veered into impropriety through its reference to
    crying and breaking down, in the context of the whole address, it did not
    deprive the accused of a fair trial.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Issue #2      No error in the trial judge’s

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>For ease of reference, I set out again the impugned instruction on
    consent:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Consent is the voluntary agreement of [the
    complainant] to take part in the sexual activity that she said happened. In
    other words, [the complainant] <span class=Underline>wanted</span><b> </b>[the accused]

lang=EN-CA>The defence made no objection to the trial judge’s instruction on
    consent at trial. Before this court, however, the accused submits that consent
    and wanting are not synonymous and, while jury instructions equating the two
    concepts are common, the use of the word “wanted” in the impugned instruction
    misled the jury into understanding that subjective desire was a necessary
    component of consent. He observes that a person might voluntarily agree to do
    acts that they do not want to perform, for a variety of motivations. For
    example, a partner might voluntarily agree to a sexual act she does not want
    out of affection or in the expectation of reciprocal pleasure. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As a result of the impugned instruction, the accused submits that
    the jury might have convicted on the basis that the complainant was strongly
    attracted to him and, voluntarily though unhappily, performed oral sex despite
    not wanting to. In support of his submission, the accused points to case law
    where courts have distinguished the two concepts. For example, the accused quotes
    from Dawe J. in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. S.M.</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, 2019 ONSC 7073, at para. 91:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Although G.C. testified that he never wanted
    to have sex with S.M., the subjective mental state of consent under Ewanchuk <span
class=Underline>is not synonymous with &quot;subjective desire&quot;. People

    balance, that the reward they will get for doing the thing outweighs their
    subjective preference not to do it</span>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>, 2010 CarswellOnt 10397</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at paras. 33-34, Croll J. found that although the complainant did
    not want to engage in sexual activity, the Crown had failed to prove lack of
    consent beyond a reasonable doubt because the complainant may have engaged in
    the sexual activity for the purpose of career advancement. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>          2.       The
    Crown’s Position</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown acknowledges that consent was a live issue in relation to
    the oral sex allegation. It points to the trial judge’s lengthy instruction on
    the meaning of consent, in which she clearly explained that the jury had to be
    satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    complainant had not consented and that the accused knew she did not consent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown contends that, in this case, there was no need for the
    trial judge to distinguish between the closely related concepts of “voluntary
    agreement” and “subjective desire”. The complainant said she did not want to
    perform oral sex and did not consent. The accused said the complainant wanted
    to perform oral sex and consented. In other words, there was no interpretation
    of the evidence that would have allowed the jury to conclude that the Crown had
    proven the complainant did not want sexual contact but failed to prove that
    there was not voluntary agreement to sexual contact. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><strong><span lang=EN-CA>B.</span></strong><span lang=EN-CA>      Analysis</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I would reject this ground of appeal. While in some cases a trial
    judge may be required to differentiate between voluntary agreement and
    subjective desire (i.e. wanting), this was not such a case. In the circumstances
    of this case, the trial judge did not err in using the word “wanted” in the
    impugned instruction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In assessing whether the jury might have been misled by the impugned
    instruction, I begin by considering it in the context of the overall instruction
    on consent. The only time that the trial judge used the word “wanted” was in
    the impugned instruction. Apart from that one instance, the trial judge
    repeatedly instructed the jury that they had to be satisfied that the
    complainant voluntarily agreed to engage in the sexual activity in question. In
    so doing, the trial judge used the statutory definition of consent in s.
    273.1(1) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. For example, the trial judge instructed the jury on the meaning of
    consent as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It involves knowledge of what is going to
    happen, and voluntary <u>agreement</u><b> </b>to do it or let it be done. A
    voluntary <u>agreement</u><b> </b>to engage in sexual activity is not valid if
    what [the complainant] said or did indicated to [the accused] that she did not <u>agree</u><b> </b>to participate in that activity. A voluntary <u>agreement</u><b> </b>to
    engage in sexual activity is also not valid, if [the complainant] had
    originally <u>agreed</u><b> </b>to participate in sexual activity but changed
    her mind and expressed in words or conduct, or both, that she did not <u>agree</u><b> </b>to continue to participate in the same or different sexual activity. [Emphasis
    added]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Next, as the accused acknowledges, a jury instruction equating
    consent with “wanting” is common. In this regard, two things are worthy of
    note. First, in the seminal case of </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Ewanchuk</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at paras. 23 and 48, the Court described the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>actus reus</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span
lang=EN-CA>of the offence of sexual assault as “unwanted sexual touching” and
    said that, for the purposes of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>actus reus</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA>, </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>consent means that the complainant in
    her mind “wanted the sexual touching to take place”. Second, the charge in this
    case tracked the language in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Watt’s Manual of
    Criminal Jury Instruction</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed
    (Toronto: Thomson Reuters Canada, 2015, Final 271), at p. 599.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>With these considerations in mind, I ask whether the impugned
    instruction might have prejudiced the accused. In my view, it could not have: there
    was nothing in the evidence upon which the jury could conclude that the
    complainant did not want to perform oral sex but she nonetheless voluntarily
    agreed to do so nor did defence counsel ever suggest that the complainant
    engaged in the sexual activity for any purpose other than subjective desire. The
    accused’s version of events was that the complainant initiated oral sex and
    that intercourse never took place.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The evidence only permitted the jury to make one of two findings:
    that the complainant did not want to perform oral sex and did not agree to do
    so or that she agreed to perform oral sex and wanted to do so. Accordingly, the
    jury could not have concluded that the Crown had proven the complainant did not
    want sexual contact but had not proven that there was no voluntary agreement to
    sexual contact.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The cases of </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>S.M.</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>and </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Shimizu</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, relied on by the accused, are readily distinguishable from the
    present case. In both those cases, the trial judge found that there was a
    possibility that the complainant agreed to the sexual activity for a reason
    other than pleasure or affection. In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>S.M.</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, the reason was money and in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Shimizu</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA>, </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>it was career advancement. In this
    case, there was no evidence that the complainant consented to engage in sexual
    activity for a reason other than a subjective desire nor was there a theory of
    the case presented to the jury that she consented for any reason other than
    subjective desire. </span></p>

    other type of communication, in the context of legislation the same word can be
    used to convey vastly different meanings. Although attention to context will
    usually narrow the potential senses in which a word is used, there may remain
    more than one possibility. Even within the same sense or definition, a word can
    have broader and narrower meanings. When it comes to interpreting the words of a
    statute used in context, an interpreter is to presume that Parliament used the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>ordinary meaning</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:
200%'> of words, rather than some technical, arcane, or exotic sense, unless
    the context suggests that a non-ordinary meaning was intended. The reason for
    the presumption is obvious enough: because legislation is an act of
    communication, communication is most likely to succeed where there is a shared
    understanding of the meaning of the words used. As Professor Michael Plaxton
    explained in his text, </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Sovereignty, Restraint, and

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Confronted with a statutory provision for the

    with a view to confusing or eluding its readers but intending to be understood

    intended a term or phrase to be given its “ordinary meaning” and not some
    obscure, technical, bizarre, or idiosyncratic meaning.</span></p>

    48, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 513, at para. 30. As a matter of first impression, the
    context in which a word is used will prompt a reader to quickly and
    subconsciously discard many inapposite senses of a word. But </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Pharmascience</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> should not be taken as suggesting that the ordinary meaning of a word is a

    notes, at p. 45, ascertaining the ordinary meaning of a provision is not
    effortless: “The phrase ‘ordinary meaning’ is deceptive in the sense that
    uncovering the meaning of words in a statute is not a simple or routine task.
    Indeed, it is often a difficult and probative exercise.” Even where language is
    straightforward, the context may carry a more nuanced meaning than might be
    expected: Hutchison, at pp. 45-47.</span></p>

    is an exacting scholarly discipline. It requires a comprehensive understanding
    of canons of interpretation and other presumptions that help the reader
    understand what it is that Parliament intended. There is a rich body of law and
    scholarship to guide interpretation, even in “easy” cases. Accordingly, before
    turning to the legislative provision in question in this appeal, and the trial
    judge’s treatment of it, I will address three complications to assessing
    ordinary meaning that are potentially relevant. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>First, dictionaries or
    other resources – such as other works of lexicographers and others who study
    language use – can be useful in ascertaining ordinary meaning. They provide
    some objective evidence of the shared conventions of language through which Parliament
    communicates. But dictionary definitions must be approached with caution. Among
    other reasons, this is because dictionaries aim to provide a comprehensive
    catalogue of all of a word’s possible uses. The legislature, however, will not
    have intended all of these possible uses, and the multiplicity of potential
    meanings can generate ambiguity and confusion. Even where no ambiguity results,
    simply applying a dictionary definition to a word taken out of context will
    result in an erroneously broad interpretation: Sullivan, at §3.31-3.32;
    Hutchinson, at pp. 45-46. Additionally, dictionaries can sometimes lag behind
    contemporary language use. It is important to avoid, on the one hand,
    anachronistic definitions unlikely to have been used by the legislature, and,
    on the other, new meanings that post-date the legislation. Dictionaries also
    vary widely in their quality and precision, and it is important to prefer those
    that are substantial works of scholarship: see “Appendix A: A Note on the Use
    of Dictionaries” in Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner, </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> (St. Paul, MN: Thompson/West, 2012), at
    pp. 415-24. However, the point of the oft-repeated caution about dictionaries
    is to use them with care, not to neglect them in favour of untutored instinct.</span></p>

    the words used will be the meaning that Parliament intended at the time of
    enactment. The original meaning is fixed and does not change with any
    subsequent linguistic drift that might occur: Driedger, at p. 163; Sullivan, at
    §6.10-6.11 This is a requirement of the rule of law: that law be knowable in
    advance such that persons can make choices and organize their lives in ways
    that do not to run afoul of it. Criminal liability cannot depend on social
    facts – like changing linguistic conventions – that are outside the control of
    the legislature or unknowable to an accused at the time of the supposed
    offence: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. D.L.W.</span></em><span lang=EN-CA

    assessing the meaning of a statutory provision, an authoritative interpreter –
    such as a court – must be concerned with the intended meaning <i>at the time of
    enactment</i>. As Dickson J. noted in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Perka</span></em><span

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>However, the “plain” or “ordinary” meaning of
    a word is not necessarily synonymous with its dictionary definition. A word’s
    ordinary meaning is “the reader’s first impression meaning, the understanding
    that spontaneously comes to mind when words are read in their immediate
    context.” This meaning is not frozen. Rather, a word’s ordinary meaning will
    change with time and context. The word “technology”, for example, means
    something very different today than it did 100 years ago. [Citing <em>Wookey</em>,
    at para. 25.]</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The definition of “recording” has changed over
    time. Recordings were historically confined to visuals that were recorded and
    could be viewed at a later time or place, such as photographs and videotapes.
    However, live transmissions, such as FaceTime [<em>sic</em>], permit visuals to
    be captured by a device and broadcast simultaneously. It is now commonly
    understood that visual recordings can be broadcast from one location and viewed
    in another simultaneously. The ordinary meaning of recording must encompass
    these new forms of technology.</span></p>

    “impressionistic” reading that contradicts established linguistic conventions
    has been explained above. The argument from the capacity of semantic meaning to
    change over time also fails, but this requires greater explanation as the
    Crown’s argument equivocates between two propositions: one inherently unsound
    and one sound but misapplied.</span></p>

    because the meaning of words can change, the meaning of a statute necessarily
    changes with them. Out of the gate, this argument stumbles over first
    principles: as explained in para. 146 above, statutory interpretation is a matter
    of ascertaining what Parliament intended to communicate through the statutory
    text at the time of enactment. Accordingly, any subsequent change in the
    meaning of the words that Parliament used has no effect on the intended
    meaning.</span></p>

    any evidence of such usage, that although the semantic meaning of “recording”
    entailed preservation, the meaning changed </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>prior</span></em><span
style='line-height:200%'> to the enactment of s. 162.1 such that it would be
    reasonable to conclude that Parliament was cognizant of such a meaning and
    intended to use the word in this way. But there is no evidence of such usage
    and the proposition that the definition of “recording” has, as a matter of
    semantic meaning, changed to include a “any visual display created by any
    means” is untenable.</span></p>

    “change”. The sound proposition within the Crown’s submission is that where
    Parliament uses broad classes and concepts to denote its meaning, it
    necessarily assigns to subsequent interpreters the task of determining whether
    some instance comes within the enumerated class or concept: Hutchison, at pp.
    45, 50-52; see also Sullivan, at §6.10. With such drafting, Parliament intends
    to accommodate changed </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>circumstances</span></em><span
style='line-height:200%'> that it did not, and perhaps could not, foresee. As
    Driedger explained, at p. 163, “words must be given the meanings they had at
    the time of enactment”, however, “the ordinary original meaning of words may be
    held to embrace things unknown when the words were used.” </span></p>

    technology that postdates the enactment of s. 162.1(2). It was ubiquitous
    technology well before the enactment of the subsection in 2015. More
    significantly, the concept of live video transmission was well known and well
    established long before that time, though not on handheld devices. Given that
    the distinction between the transmission of a live event and the transmission
    of a recording was well known, s. 162.1(2)’s specific focus on the transmission
    of a recording is significant and cannot be dismissed with the argument that
    the concept of recording or archiving, though once a necessary precondition to
    transmission, is now obsolete. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> makes it obvious that Parliament was well
    aware of the distinction between live-stream transmissions and transmissions of
    recordings, particularly when one considers the nuanced vocabulary Parliament
    used. For example, the offence for voyeurism under s. 162 explicitly
    distinguishes between the action of </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>observing</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>(</span><em><span lang=EN-CA>i.e.</span></em><span

    making a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>visual recording</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, both of which are proscribed. As with s.
    162.1, Parliament specifically defines a “visual recording” as including “a
    photographic, film or video recording made by any means”. The context, listing
    “video recording” with photographic and film recordings, confirms the archival
    nature of “video recording”, and thereby “visual recording”. In contrast, under
    s. 163.1, Parliament uses the broad category of “video or other visual </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>representation</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>”
    (emphasis added), rather than the narrower category of “visual recording”.
    Between ss. 162 and 163.1, which flank either end of s. 162.1, electronically </span><em><span

    been no relevant technological change that bears on the meaning of s. 162.1. What
    the Crown is left with is the proposition that a reauthoring of the provision
    would better achieve s. 162.1’s purpose, being to protect human dignity and
    privacy by prohibiting the transmission of intimate visual images. But where
    Parliament chooses specific means to achieve its ends, the court is not
    permitted to choose different means any more than it would be permitted to
    choose different ends. The interpretive question is not what best promotes the
    section’s purpose, such that courts can modify the text to best bring about
    that result, but rather </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>how</span></em><span

    Courts are required to respect chosen </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>means</span></em><span

    enacted s. 162.1(1), leaving “intimate image” undefined, the Crown’s case would
    be plausible. But by specifying that an “intimate image” is a recording, courts

    rejected. There is no evidence in the record before this court that “visual
    recording” has ever been used in this way. Often, debates over statutory
    interpretation revolve around which of several possible meanings is apt. In
    this case, there is no contest between rival meanings. What the Crown has
    proffered as the ordinary meaning of a “visual recording” is not only not the
    ordinary meaning, it is an invented meaning. Although the Crown’s argument is
    framed in terms of ascertaining the conventional, ordinary meaning of language,
    it is actually an argument about what meaning </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>ought</span></em><span

    that in enacting s. 162.1, Parliament intended to protect human dignity and
    privacy by prohibiting the transmission of intimate visual images. It was
    responding specifically to instances of great personal harm caused by persons
    who had uploaded or distributed intimate images of women and girls. Although it
    was already an offence under s. 162(4) to distribute voyeuristic recordings, s.
    162.1 created an additional offence of distributing intimate visual recordings
    that had been made non-voyeuristically. The type of visual recordings caught by
    this provision was intended to be extremely broad: “visual recording of a
    person made by any means”. Thus, s. 162.1 captures not only means of recording
    that existed at the time of enactment, or those that were specifically
    enumerated, but all means of recording, present and future. </span></p>

    that because Parliament intended to capture all means of making a recording and
    a very broad class of means of distribution, it therefore also intended to
    define “intimate image” as broadly as the Crown contends. The text and context
    both suggest otherwise. Parliament did not need to define “intimate image” in terms
    of a “visual recording”. Had intimate image been left undefined by s. 161.1(2),
    it would arguably have been broad enough to include live-streamed images.
    However, Parliament chose to specify the meaning as “visual recording” rather
    than “visual display”, “visual depiction”, or “visual representation”, as in s.
    163.1(1)(a). All of these options were open to Parliament, and it instead chose
    the more restrictive category of visual recording. </span></p>

    existence of FaceTime video calling is not an unforeseen circumstance. FaceTime
    existed before 2015, and live video transmission generally existed long before
    FaceTime. Parliament was aware of both the existence of this technology and the
    language used to describe it. A recording is not a necessary precondition for
    the transmission of every type of image. But even if the Crown was correct on
    this point, it would not follow that the transmission of non-recorded,
    live-streamed images and the transmission of recorded images, would therefore
    now both be known as the transmission of recordings. There is no basis upon
    which to find that any change in technology or circumstance warrants
    reinventing the meaning of “recording”.</span></p>

    definition, there would be an ambiguity in the meaning of “image”, in which
    case it could have indicated something that can be seen (e.g. a visual display)
    or recorded (and, typically, capable of repeated viewing). But the definition
    resolves the ambiguity in favour of the latter. This is a reasoned choice by
    Parliament, and this court is required to respect chosen means as well as ends.</span></p>

    serious violation of human dignity. But it did not intend s. 162.1 to stand as
    a complete code. It is supplemental to the voyeurism offences in s. 162.
    Section 162.1 does not capture, and was not intended to capture, every act by
    which one person injures others by exposing them to the view of third parties.
    It did not, for example, criminalize acts such as the accused opening the
    bathroom door and exposing the complainant to the view of the friends he
    invited into his apartment. Each of these friends was in the same position to
    record the complainant as any of his other friends who received a FaceTime

    and there is no good reason to conclude that this decision was unintended or
    that it undermines Parliament’s purpose in enacting the legislation it did. The

    by an unlimited number of people. A live-stream transmission cannot. It is not
    irrational or arbitrary for the criminal law to differentiate between them. Of
    course, a live-stream transmission is </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>capable</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> of being recorded, requiring only the

    conclusion reached by the trial judge: s. 162.1 prohibits the transmission of a
    recording. It does not prohibit the transmission of images that are not
    recordings. A FaceTime video call operates by transmitting images that have not
    first been recorded and are never recorded in the course of transmission,

    recording as a live-stream transmission, preferring the definition used by
    everyone else. The Crown thus faced an evidential hurdle. In order to defeat
    the directed verdict application, the Crown needed to establish that a FaceTime
    video call transmitted “a recording” as that word is ordinarily understood: </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>a depiction that outlasts the event it

    its recipient does not mean it was a transmission of a recording rather than a

    colleague argues that s. 162 could not apply in the circumstances of the
    present case because the accused was not acting surreptitiously. It should be
    noted, again, that because there was no charge brought under s. 162, there were
    no submissions on this point and no adjudication. This court has not yet
    pronounced on the meaning of “surreptitious” in the context of s. 162. The

    that a man who opens a bathroom door and livestreams someone in the position of

    electronically soon becomes aware of it but is powerless to stop it.</p>
