  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Harvison Young J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals his conviction for the second
    degree murder of Mark Gilby. Mr. Gilby was found dead in his apartment on Gale
    Crescent on January 19, 2014. The appellant knew Mr. Gilby and occasionally
    bought marijuana from him. He was captured on surveillance footage entering and
    leaving Mr. Gilby’s apartment building during the morning of the murder. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Central to the Crown’s case was a confession
    that the appellant made to undercover police officers more than a year after
    Mr. Gilby was found dead in his apartment. The confession was the culmination
    of an eight-month operation during which the Niagara Regional Police befriended
    the appellant and recruited him into a fictitious criminal organization.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the course of the confession, Mr. Quinton
    divulged a number of details of the murder that, according to the Crown,
    corroborated his confession. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In circumstances that I will discuss in greater
    detail below, the trial judge did not hold a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>voir
    dire</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> on the issues as set out in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Hart</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2014 SCC 52, [2014] 2
    S.C.R. 544. The appellant argues that this was clearly an operation that fell
    within the parameters of a “Mr. Big” operation. This rendered the confession
    presumptively inadmissible and required the trial judge to conduct a <em>voir
    dire</em> to determine whether it met the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hart</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> test for admissibility. Moreover, he takes the position that had
    the trial judge applied the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hart</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> test and held a <em>voir dire</em>, there was ample basis to exclude
    the confession for two reasons: first, because its probative value did not
    outweigh its prejudicial effect; and second, because the circumstances leading
    up to the confession as a whole constituted an abuse of process on the part of
    the police, given the relationship that developed with the accused and his
    particular vulnerabilities. He seeks a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also submits that even if the trial
    judge did not err in admitting the confessions, he erred in failing to charge
    the jury in accordance with </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Mack</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, 2014 SCC 58, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 3.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent Crown argues that the trial judge
    did not err in failing to hold a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hart</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> <em>voir dire</em> because the defence counsel at trial waived it
    at trial. It takes the position that in any event, any concerns about the
    reliability of the evidence were addressed by the corroborative evidence and also
    submits that nothing in the circumstances gave rise to abuse of process
    concerns. Finally, it submits that the charge to the jury met the functional
    requirements of <em>Mack</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal and order a new trial. This was clearly a case to which the <em>Hart</em> considerations applied. The appellant did not waive a <em>voir dire</em>, and
    even had he done so, the waiver of the <em>voir dire</em> would have been
    invalid. It is not clear that the statement would have been admitted had a <em>voir
    dire </em>been held. In particular, the confession raised abuse of process
    concerns that needed to be canvassed in a <em>voir dire</em>. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The murder</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mark Gilby was discovered shortly before 5:00
    p.m. in his apartment entryway surrounded by blood and without vital signs. He died
    of blunt force injuries to the head, likely caused by a hammer or a hammer like
    tool. His friend Diane Doucette had become increasingly alarmed when she was
    unable to reach him on his phone throughout the day. She and a friend had gone
    to his apartment around 4:30pm. When there was no answer to the door, which was
    locked, they called 911. Paramedics found the body without vital signs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Gilby had been given two sets of keys to his
    apartment, including electronic building fobs which had distinct serial numbers.
    Mr. Gilby was in frail condition and used a motorized scooter. One set of his
    apartment and scooter keys could not be located in his apartment after the
    murder.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The evidence against the appellant</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant quickly became a person of
    interest in the murder after surveillance footage indicated that he had been at
    the deceased’s apartment on the day of the murder. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Surveillance footage first captured the
    appellant at Mr. Gilby’s apartment shortly before 10 a.m. on the day of the
    murder. After waiting in the vestibule area, he left the building and walked
    back in the direction that he came from. Afterwards, the appellant was captured
    on St. Catharines Motorcycle Centre surveillance footage travelling on his
    bicycle northbound on Riordan Street, just north of where it intersects with
    Gale Crescent. He was wearing a dark jacket, dark pants, dark shoes, and gloves. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At 10:25 a.m., the appellant again approached the
    intercom panel in the vestibule area of Mr. Gilby’s building. After some
    discussion with a resident who was leaving the building, the appellant again
    left.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant walked down the sidewalk before
    turning around and returning to the vestibule. At 10:29 a.m., he used the
    intercom to call Mr. Gilby and he was granted entry. The appellant walked
    towards the elevator. He was out of view for approximately seven minutes before
    he reappeared and exited the building at 10:37 a.m. When he reappeared, the
    surveillance footage appeared to show some discoloration in the pocket areas of
    the appellant’s jacket, as well as something bulging and protruding from his
    pockets. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant conceded his identity in the
    surveillance footage and the fact that he was at the apartment to see Mr.
    Gilby. The appellant testified that, on his last visit that day, someone he
    thought was Mr. Gilby answered his call from the intercom and buzzed him into the
    building, but that when he knocked on Mr. Gilby’s unit there was no answer, so
    he left. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Approximately one-and-a-half hours after the
    appellant left Mr. Gilby’s apartment, he was captured on surveillance footage
    riding his bicycle. He was wearing a different jacket and shoes. The appellant
    testified that he changed his clothes because he got splashed while riding his
    bicycle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police searched the appellant’s apartment and
    seized clothing and a pair of boots. No blood was found on the items. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified that he had been to Mr.
    Gilby’s Gale Crescent apartment 10-15 times to purchase marijuana prior to the
    date of the murder. On at least one occasion, he saw Mr. Gilby go into a
    toolbox in his bedroom and return with half an ounce of marijuana. He testified
    that, on January 18, 2014, the day before the murder, he attended Mr. Gilby’s
    residence and bought a gram of marijuana that Mr. Gilby had in a coat pocket in
    the closet of the apartment entryway. The appellant testified that on that
    date, there were no other people in the apartment that he could see. He further
    testified that on the other occasions when he visited Mr. Gilby, he was
    generally alone in the apartment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s friend Sharon Shaw testified
    that she and the appellant would meet regularly and smoke marijuana together,
    which she purchased from the appellant. The appellant would purchase the
    marijuana from a number of sources, including Mr. Gilby. Ms. Shaw told police
    that two weeks after the murder of Mr. Gilby, the appellant gave her $170 in
    cash and a half-ounce of marijuana for free. She testified that this was out of
    the ordinary for the appellant. Ms. Shaw also testified that around this time,
    the appellant told her that he had a female friend who helped him dispose of a
    weapon. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span

lang=EN-CA>The circumstances of the appellant</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the time of the murder, the appellant was
    living on disability benefits, which usually amounted to just over $1,000 a
    month. He testified that he had a trustee who handled his money, because he was
    not very good with money. His trustee ensured that he had enough money for rent
    and hydro. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After his expenses, he had around $500 a month
    leftover, which he mostly spent on alcohol and marijuana. He would often become
    intoxicated by the afternoon and would regularly drink to the point of passing
    out. He frequented Start Me Up Niagara, where he could receive free meals. He
    resold cigarette packs at a $5 profit on the side.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant had documented anxiety and clinical
    depression, for which he took medication. After the murder, the appellant
    appeared to be in a bad mental state. His 58<sup>th</sup> birthday was coming
    up, and he was depressed because he was about to outlive his father, who had
    died by suicide over 20 years earlier. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In March, about two months after the murder, he
    sent Ms. Shaw a note. He and Ms. Shaw had a falling out, which he discussed in
    his note. He said he was depressed and heartbroken by what happened with Ms.
    Shaw. He also gave her his bank card and told her to withdraw $500 and to “do something
    useful with it.” She thought the note was a suicide note and went to the police
    with it.</span></p>

    Police launched “Project Gale,” an undercover operation to investigate the
    appellant for the murder of Mr. Gilby. Detective Sergeant Sean Polly acted as

    not tell the undercover operators anything about the investigation or the
    appellant.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 3, 2014, Ralph Hopiavuori, the principal
    undercover officer, established contact with the appellant by defending him
    from another undercover officer pretending to be an aggressive panhandler. Det.
    Hopiavuori was not aware of the details of the homicide, simply that there was
    a suspect. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Det. Hopiavuori then started attending
    breakfasts at Start Me Up Niagara. One day, the appellant invited Det. Hopiavuori
    to his home after they ran into each other on the street while the appellant
    was inebriated, and Det. Hopiavuori was carrying a six-pack of beer. This
    became a regular event. Det. Hopiavuori would attend the appellant’s apartment
    to watch movies together. Sometimes, Det. Hopiavuori would bring food or beer
    with him to share with whoever was in the appellant’s apartment. While the
    appellant would smoke marijuana almost daily, Det. Hopiavuori never smoked with
    him. During these encounters, the appellant would become very intoxicated,
    sometimes to the point of losing control of his bowels or bladder.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In mid-July 2014, Det. Hopiavuori recruited the appellant
    to Project Gale’s fictional criminal organization that trafficked in contraband
    cigarettes and stolen property from the United States and Southern Ontario and
    arranged for passports to be forged to enable its members to cross the border.
    The appellant went on “box runs” in which Det. Hopiavuori would drive him to
    various locations and the appellant would load boxes of what he thought was
    contraband with Det. Hopiavuori and other members of the organization. They
    also attended simulated business meetings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to Det. Hopiavuori, there were around
    a dozen other officers who pretended to work for the organization, although the
    appellant was not introduced to all of them. The appellant became acquainted
    with Detective Sergeant Chris Lemaich and Detective Constable Kevin Neufeld. Det.
    Lemaich acted as someone with a similar role as the appellant and Det. Neufeld
    acted as someone in a higher position within the organization. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Once, the appellant attended a clubhouse near
    Kitchener that was apparently affiliated with the organization. According to
    the appellant’s testimony the clubhouse had pool tables, a Bentley, and was
    lined with motorcycles. During this period, the appellant occasionally
    travelled to hotels and casinos with Det. Hopiavuori and others. The appellant
    testified that he thought that Det. Neufeld was connected to a biker gang.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In late August 2014, the appellant suffered a
    stroke and was hospitalized for 16 days. Det. Hopiavuori visited the appellant in
    the hospital regularly and Det. Neufeld visited once or twice. The appellant
    testified that no one else had come to see him, aside from one visit from a
    Start Me Up Niagara worker. Det. Hopiavuori also assisted the appellant by
    checking in on his home while he was in the hospital, delivering his marijuana
    and cigarettes to the hospital, and paying for a TV for his hospital room. He
    also returned the appellant’s overdue DVDs to the library and retrieved his
    bank card. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the appellant was discharged, he had a
    severe leg tremor and was unable to walk or take showers unassisted. He was
    initially reliant on a wheelchair but Det. Hopiavuori bought him a walker as
    well as clothing, food, and a haircut. Det. Hopiavuori also drove him to
    doctor’s appointments. By his own words, the appellant was helpless after his
    stroke. He went from being a mobile person to being affected by leg tremors. The
    appellant continued to take part in the box runs after his stroke but in a
    modified capacity. Before his stroke, he assisted with moving boxes of
    contraband. After his stroke, his job was to keep watch for the police. He conducted
    11 or 12 more runs, to further locations, and his compensation increased to
    between $50 and $100 per run. Det. Hopiavuori continued to provide him with
    food and beer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the appellant was in the hospital, he was
    questioned by homicide detectives about Mr. Gilby’s murder. He testified that
    the police would show up at his home and he would regularly bump into them on
    the street. In December, after what appeared to be months of increasing police
    pressure, Operation Gale staged a scenario where the appellant and Det.
    Hopiavuori were pulled over by the police. The police confiscated cigarettes
    from Det. Hopiavuori’s truck, purportedly worth thousands of dollars. When
    questioned by Det. Neufeld about how this happened, Det. Hopiavuori told him
    that the appellant was the suspect in a murder. Det. Neufeld assured them that
    he would arrange something that would get the police to leave the appellant
    alone. He came up with the following plan. The appellant would relay the
    details of the murder to Det. Lemaich, who was supposedly dying of cancer. In
    exchange, Det. Lemaich would receive $10,000 from Det. Neufeld, for him to give
    to his family. Det. Lemaich was going to receive $5,000 up front and then
    $5,000 after he confessed. It was in this context that the appellant ultimately
    confessed to the murder. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The lead-up to the confession began on Monday,
    February 2, 2015, when the appellant’s Red Cross worker did not show up to help
    the appellant shower. The next day, Det. Hopiavuori took him to a hotel where
    he could bathe himself. On Wednesday, Det. Hopiavuori drove him home to
    retrieve medication he left behind. As part of the scenario, police were
    outside the appellant’s door when they arrived. The appellant wanted to stop
    and speak to them, but Det. Hopiavuori convinced him to return to the hotel. On
    Thursday, Det. Hopiavuori took the appellant to the doctor to obtain a new
    prescription. They planned to go to a pharmacy on Friday. At multiple points, the
    appellant suggested that he call the police or that he go back to his place.
    Det. Hopiavuori told the appellant that he would not take the appellant back to
    his apartment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By this point, the appellant was, in his words, a
    mess. He had been without his medication for several days and was in an altered
    mental state. He said that he had no idea what was happening with his head and
    that he did not know where he was. The increasing pressure he felt throughout
    the week from the undercover officers to confess exacerbated this. He confessed
    on Thursday and Friday. He stated that he attended Mr. Gilby’s apartment, stole
    his marijuana, and attacked him with a hammer that he brought with him. On his
    way out, he took Mr. Gilby’s keys from the ignition of his scooter and locked
    the door. He turned his jacket inside out, as he was covered in blood, called a
    cab and returned home. He left the hammer in a park and threw the keys in a
    sewer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>His confession came out in fragments. The
    appellant alleges that many details were prompted by Det. Hopiavuori and other
    officers. When his narrative contradicted known facts about the murder, Det. Hopiavuori
    challenged him on it and worked with him to create a coherent narrative. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On Thursday, Dets. Hopiavuori and Neufeld took
    the appellant to a hardware store where the appellant pointed out a hammer
    similar to the one he said he used to kill Mr. Gilby. No hammer was ever found
    in the park. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On Friday, the appellant said that he disposed
    of the keys with the hammer or elsewhere in the park. Later that day, however,
    the appellant brought Dets. Hopiavuori and Neufeld to a sewer where he said he
    threw the keys. The keys were found in the sewer. The appellant was arrested
    and charged shortly thereafter.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span

    Crown took the position that </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hart </span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>did not apply because the appellant did
    not make a Mr. Big confession. On appeal, the Crown did not seek to maintain this
    position, arguing instead that the appellant waived the need for a </span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hart voir dire</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:

lang=EN-CA>Hart </span></em><span lang=EN>dealt with the admissibility of
    confessions made in the course of Mr. Big investigations. The classic Mr. Big operation
    involves the luring of a suspect into a fictitious criminal organization. The
    suspect is offered financial inducements and friendship. The operation
    “culminates with an interview-like meeting between the suspect and Mr. Big”: </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hart</span></em><span lang=EN>, at para. 2. During this interview,
    Mr. Big questions the suspect about the crime and pushes the suspect for a
    confession. By confessing, the suspect can gain acceptance into the fictious
    criminal organization. Confessions made during a Mr. Big investigation are
    presumptively inadmissible, because of the dangers posed by the investigative
    technique.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[40]<span

lang=EN>In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hart</span></em><span lang=EN>, Moldaver
    J. foresaw that police might make superficial changes to their operations to avoid </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hart</span></em><span lang=EN>. As a result, he
    defined a Mr. Big investigation broadly, at paras. 10, 85: “</span><span
class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>where the state recruits an accused into a
    fictitious criminal organization of its own making and seeks to elicit a
    confession from him</span></span><span lang=EN>…any confession is presumptively

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, this court took an expansive view of the application of <em>Hart</em> in <em>R. v. Kelly</em>, 2017 ONCA 621, 387 C.R.R. (2d) 93, leave
    to appeal dismissed, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 474. Feldman J.A. wrote, at para. 35,
    that although the undercover operation in <em>Kelly</em> did not have the “most
    offensive tactics” of the traditional Mr. Big operation, <em>Hart </em>still
    applied. The relevant question to determine whether <em>Hart </em>applies to an
    operation is whether the operation poses the potential for the three dangers
    identified in <em>Hart</em>: “unreliable confessions, the prejudicial effect of
    the evidence of the appellant’s participation in the scheme, and the potential
    for police misconduct”: <em>Kelly</em>, at para. 35.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The appellant’s confession satisfies the requisite
    criteria. The operation satisfies the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hart </span></em><span
lang=EN>definition because (i) the state recruited the appellant into a
    fictitious criminal organization of its own making in order to (ii) elicit a
    confession: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hart</span></em><span lang=EN>, at
    para. 10. The expanded criteria in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Kelly</span></em><span
lang=EN> are also met. As the following analysis discloses, the operation used
    to secure the appellant’s confession posed the potential of producing an
    unreliable confession, generated prejudicial evidence relating to the
    appellant’s participation in the scheme, and had the potential for police
    misconduct.</span><span lang=EN> </span><span lang=EN-CA>The confession was
    presumptively inadmissible, and the requirement for a <em>voir dire</em> was
    triggered, in which the Crown would have to show the confession to be

    evidence is for the trial judge to determine: <em>R. v. J.H.</em>, 2020 ONCA
    165, at para. 56. The party seeking to admit presumptively inadmissible
    evidence “must apply to the trial judge for an order permitting its reception”: <em>J.H.</em>, at para. 57. The general practice is to invoke s. 645(5) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> and to have the application heard before jury selection: <em>J.H.</em>,
    at para. 58. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Of course, a party may generally waive the benefit
    of exclusionary rules, thereby permitting presumptively inadmissible evidence
    to be received. The respondent argues that this occurred here. It maintains
    that through his trial counsel the appellant exercised his right to waive a </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hart voir dire</span></em><span lang=EN>. The respondent contends
    that absent an ineffective assistance of counsel argument (which the appellant
    did not advance), the appellant must live with the consequences of tactical
    decisions made by his counsel. Counsel is presumed to know the law. He was
    aware of </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hart </span></em><span lang=EN>and the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>voir dire </span></em><span lang=EN>procedure, as is evident by his
    lengthy submissions to the trial judge on this issue. He made a tactical decision
    to dispense </span><span lang=EN-CA>with the<em> voir dire</em></span><span
lang=EN>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the law of waiver is unique as it
    applies to confessions, no doubt because a confession is often decisive in
    establishing guilt. A trial judge is obliged to conduct a <em>voir dire </em>into
    the admissibility of a confession, even in the absence of objection, unless the
    right to a <em>voir dire</em> has been expressly waived: <em>Park v. R.</em>, [1981]
    2 S.C.R. 64, at p. 70. In <em>R. v. Sabir</em>, 2018 ONCA 912, 367 C.C.C. (3d)
    426, at para. 24, Strathy C.J.O. described what is required:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As the Supreme
    Court explained in </span><span class=ssit2><span lang=EN-CA style='color:#373739'>R.
    v. Park</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 64, at p. 73, there is
    no particular wording or formula required to communicate an informed waiver.
    However, the waiver must be express. &quot;The question is: Does the accused
    indeed waive the requirement of a </span><span class=ssit2><span lang=EN-CA
style='color:#373739'>voir dire</span></span><span lang=EN-CA> and admit that
    the statement is voluntary and admissible in evidence?&quot;: </span><span
class=ssit2><span lang=EN-CA style='color:#373739'>R. v. Park</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>, at p. 74. In the context of a waiver made by defence counsel, the
    court stated that the trial judge must be &quot;satisfied that counsel understands
    the matter and has made an informed decision to waive the </span><span
class=ssit2><span lang=EN-CA style='color:#373739'>voir dire</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>&quot;: at p. 73.The onus on a trial judge with respect to
    voluntariness is high, even where an accused is represented by counsel. As the
    Supreme Court noted in </span><span class=ssit2><span lang=EN-CA
style='color:#373739'>R. v. Hodgson</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>, [1998] 2
    S.C.R. 449, at para. 41: &quot;The trial judge has a duty 'to conduct the trial
    judicially quite apart from lapses of counsel': see </span><span class=ssit2><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:#373739'>R. v. Sweezey</span></span><span lang=EN-CA> (1974),
    20 C.C.C. (2d) 400 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 417. This includes the duty to hold a </span><span
class=ssit2><span lang=EN-CA style='color:#373739'>voir dire</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA> whenever the prosecution seeks to adduce a statement of the accused
    made to a person in authority”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Once a waiver has been offered the trial judge
    has discretion to accept the waiver, to hold a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>voir

    factual admissions underlying the waiver: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Park</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at p. 70.</span><span lang=EN-CA> Although a trial judge is not
    required to make inquiries before accepting the waiver, the trial judge must be

lang=EN-CA>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, at para. 41,</span><em><span lang=EN-CA> </span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>Cory J. noted that “where the defence has not requested a </span><em><span

    accused is admitted into evidence, the trial judge will only have committed
    reversible error if clear evidence existed in the record which objectively
    should have alerted him or her to the need for a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>voir
    dire </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>notwithstanding counsel’s silence.” It
    follows that if a statement of the accused is admitted into evidence without a
    valid waiver, the trial judge will have committed a reversible error if clear
    evidence existed in the record which objectively should have alerted him or her
    to the need for a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>voir dire</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I will explain, this review of the law
    exposes problems in finding that the appellant waived his right to a </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>voir dire</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. First, defence counsel did
    not purport to waive the right to a required </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>voir
    dire</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. Instead, he erroneously conceded that a </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>voir dire</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> was not required because the rule
    requiring a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>voir dire </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>did
    not apply. This concession was not a “waiver”. Second, it is evident that
    defence counsel did not understand the law that applies, and the trial judge
    accepted the “waiver” without satisfying himself that counsel understood the matter
    and made an informed decision. Indeed, there was clear evidence on the record
    that should have alerted the trial judge to the need for a </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>voir dire </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>to determine compliance with
    the rule in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hart</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>,
    notwithstanding defence counsel’s mistaken concession that the rule did not
    apply. Hence, even if defence counsel’s concesssion amounts to a waiver, it was
    not a valid waiver. </span></p>

    discussion. When new counsel attended a continued judicial pre-trial, he was
    not fully versed in the appellant’s case. There was no discussion about a <em>Hart
    voir dire </em>at that point<em>.</em> He stated that he believed that the only
    live issue at the continued pre-trial was the <em>Charter</em> compliance of

    weeks prior to the start of the trial, advising Crown counsel that he believed
    that <em>Hart </em>applied. Crown counsel disagreed and took the position that
    defence counsel bore the onus of proving that the investigation was a Mr. Big
    operation before the Crown was required to establish the admissibility of the
    confession. It seems that the Crown took this position because, according to
    him, there was no criminal hierarchy or violence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue did not come up again until mid-trial.
    In his cross-examination of Det. Polly, defence counsel asked questions related
    to the nature of the operation and the officer’s understanding of the
    appellant’s alcohol addiction, seemingly to establish a factual record for
    admissibility. The trial judge challenged defence counsel on the relevance of
    this line of questioning. The next morning, on March 1, 2017, defence counsel
    made his first submissions on <em>Hart</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[A]t the end of my
    questioning of, of this witness, I would be arguing that <em>Hart </em>applies…after
    this witness is completed, I would be asking for you to make a finding. I would
    ask that then we would <em>voir dire </em>the, the next witness. Not
    necessarily about the statements themselves, just about circumstances in which
    the statements were taken, the utterances were taken. And, and Your Honour
    would, would make a finding that if the Crown had or had not satisfied the onus
    that I believe is now a common law onus.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Upon hearing this, the trial judge was concerned
    that this was not canvassed at the pre-trial stage and was specifically
    concerned that the jury would be inconvenienced by the time it would take to
    make a decision on this issue. The trial judge initially characterized the
    question as whether or not the confession would go into evidence. At this,
    defence counsel offered a “third course”:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I think Your
    Honour will find that <em>Mack </em>is the, is, is – covers the ground here and
    that you will suggest that we just hear the evidence in front of the, the jury
    and then at the end Your Honour can make appropriate cautions about the, about
    the evidence…there are two – three outcomes…You could just deny the, the
    application, assuming that you’ll hear the application, you’ll deny the
    application. And I can understand how that could happen. You could grant the
    application, do the <em>voir dire </em>and – <span class=Underline>with the
    remedies that are available or I think with an eye to the <i>Mack</i> case</span> which is a case, as I understand it, and please, I, I don’t – <span
class=Underline>I’m not terribly familiar with it at this juncture</span>. But
    in, in <em>Mack </em>the trial proceeded to, to the end and the issue was the,
    the judge making the appropriate cautionary remarks to the jury about what use
    they can put the evidence to. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial Crown stated that he would have called
    its evidence in an entirely different manner had he known that this issue would
    have been raised. He also stated his position that, if there was a <em>voir

    and call other police witnesses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    admissibility of the confession paused so that the cross-examination of Det.
    Polly could be completed. The issue was again addressed after the completion of
    the cross-examination. The trial judge summarized the live issues in this way:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As I see it, there
    are two issues for the Court to consider at this point. The first is should
    there be consideration of the confession, at this point, based on pre-trial
    conference discussions. To put that another way, the whole point of pre-trial
    discussions is to sort out in advance issues that are going to impact the
    trial, so that once the trial begins, particularly with a jury, it can proceed
    with relative efficiency, if I can call it that. The second issue for me to
    consider at this point is – and I’ll put this in, in a short form, does <em>Hart </em>apply. <span class=Underline>In other words, is there sufficient evidence
    of a Mr. Big operation to trigger the presumption of inadmissibility at common
    law?</span> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Crucially, from this point on, it seems that the

    – not whether the confession was ultimately admissible. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Crown counsel again insisted that if a <em>voir

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I don’t know what the procedure is for you to
    consult with your colleague but no such application was brought before the
    Court. The Crown would have called its evidence in an entirely different manner.

    tell you there are – in order for the Crown to make the record complete, there
    are 280 hours of recorded conversations.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It’s up to the
    Crown to put all of the admissible evidence that would be relevant, in terms of

    with all those factors in mind.</span></p>

    on this position. Defence counsel stated that he anticipated that a <em>voir
    dire </em>would take a few hours. The trial judge stated that it would not be
    necessary or realistic to hear all the intercepts to determine whether there
    was a Mr. Big or not. The trial judge indicated that a <em>voir dire </em>with
    280 hours of recordings would lead to a mistrial. However, Crown counsel reiterated
    his position that all 280 hours would have to be introduced into evidence. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge again expressed concern about
    the effect that a long <em>voir dire </em>would have on the jury and encouraged
    counsel to come to make reasonable concessions to shorten the time required for
    a <em>voir dire</em>. He also encouraged counsel to have an off-the-record
    discussion.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Well, it might – can I suggest that rather

    returned having come to an agreement that: (i) defence would accept the Crown’s
    position that there was no Mr. Big within the meaning of <em>Hart</em>; (ii)
    the issue of the reliability of the statement would be left to the jury; and
    (iii) counsel would be expecting an instruction from the trial judge about the
    nature of the inducements provided to the appellant. The Crown addressed the

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Your Honour, Mr.

    legal basis for the conclusion that this was not a Mr. Big confession. But
    during the pre-charge discussions, defence counsel made the following comment,
    suggesting that in his view the criminal activity was not sufficiently serious,
    and the organization was not sufficiently hierarchical to technically
    constitute a Mr. Big operation: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[W]hether Your

    position that the crimes were not sufficiently serious for the operation to
    constitute a Mr. Big operation. In pre-charge discussions, he distinguished
    between Project Gale and a Mr. Big operation in the following way:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[U]nlike a Mr. Big
    where they’re looking at some serious bad crime and in effect having to prove
    that you’re capable of similar bad crime … this is to me some petty crime about

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The purported waiver
    was not a waiver</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent’s submissions that the appellant
    waived his right to a Mr. Big <em>voir dire</em> cannot be accepted. Appellant’s
    trial counsel did not advise the court that the appellant was waiving his right
    to a <em>voir dire</em> into the admissibility of the confession. Instead, he had
    agreed to accept the Crown position that Mr. Big did not apply. No waiver
    occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Even if defence counsel’s mistaken concession
    that <em>Hart</em> did not apply to the appellant’s confession qualified as a
    waiver, it would not have been a valid waiver. The decision made by defence
    counsel was not informed and the trial judge failed to determine that it was. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, it does not seem that defence counsel
    appreciated the legal issues involved. The entirety of the on-the-record
    discussion, prior to the purported waiver, related to the question of whether <em>Hart </em>applied to the confession. None of the discussion related to the
    admissibility of the confession under <em>Hart</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, it does not appear that defence
    counsel had turned his mind to the abuse of process concerns in this case.
    Defence counsel’s response to the trial judge’s challenge to the relevance of
    his questioning of Det. Polly related to the nature of the inducements provided
    and how those inducements may undermine the reliability of the statement. Not
    once during this exchange or during pre-charge discussions did defence counsel
    highlight the abuse of process concerns. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The agreement counsel reached after their
    off-the-record discussion was not an agreement that fully informed defence
    counsel would have made. After the discussion, defence counsel agreed to accept
    Crown counsel’s position that <em>Hart </em>did not apply. In return, Crown
    counsel agreed that a <em>Mack</em>-style jury warning on the reliability of
    the confession would be given. However, the appellant would have been entitled
    to a jury warning on the reliability of the confession in any event if the
    evidence was admitted after a <em>voir dire</em>. A jury warning is required in
    every single case involving an admissible Mr. Big confession. Defence counsel
    received nothing in return for his concession. As appellant counsel described,
    this agreement was more of an unconditional surrender than it was a deal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, statements made by defence counsel further
    support the view that the waiver was not informed. Defence counsel was, by his
    own admission, unfamiliar with the law around Mr. Big confessions. During the
    pre-charge discussions, defence counsel characterized the operation as a “Mr.
    Big style operation, except with a very small Mr. Big and a very mundane and
    paltry criminal organization.” The only case that defence counsel relied upon
    in his submissions other than <em>Hart </em>and <em>Mack </em>was <em>R. v. Derbyshire</em>,
    2016 NSCA 67, 340 C.C.C. (3d) 1. <em>Derbyshire </em>did not involve a Mr. Big
    investigation. Indeed, the circumstances of <em>Derbyshire</em> were far afield
    from this case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Upon review of the statements made by counsel on
    the record, the nature of the agreement reached off-the-record, and the legal
    issues, the only reasonable inference is that defence counsel did not
    understand the legal issues and did not appreciate the implications of the
    waiver of the <em>voir dire</em>. In short, the purported waiver was not
    informed. Yet the trial judge failed to satisfy himself that counsel understood
    the matter and had made an informed decision to waive the <em>voir dire. </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>He should have done so.</span></em><em> </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>There was ample evidence on the record that should
    have alerted the trial judge that </span></em><em>Hart </em><em><span

lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, this is not the end of the analysis. When
    there is no <em>voir dire </em>at trial, appellate courts will not intervene if
    it is clear that the statement would have met the admissibility threshold if a <em>voir
    dire</em> had been held: <em>R. v. Niemi</em>, 2017 ONCA 720, 355 C.C.C. (3d)
    344, at paras. 3, 28; <em>Kelly</em>, at para. 78. </span></p>

    at trial, before the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Hart</em>. Paciocco J.A.
    dismissed the appeal, as he found that the statements would have been admitted
    under the <em>Hart</em> test. In his confession, Mr. Niemi had provided a
    number of unreleased details of the murder. This bolstered the reliability of
    the confession, “in spite of the non-coercive inducements” given to secure the
    confession: at para. 29. The probative value of the statements was
    “impressive”: at para. 29. In addition, there was no abuse of process; the
    trial judge found that the Mr. Big operation was “exemplary” and “excellent

    problematic because there is a risk that the confession is unreliable and an
    admitted confession is generally accompanied by bad character evidence: <em>Hart</em>,
    at paras. 68-77. In addition, Mr. Big operations “create a risk that the police
    will resort to unacceptable tactics in their pursuit of a confession”: <em>Hart</em>,

    that counsel should attempt to come to an agreement and make reasonable
    concessions and, in the end, defence counsel conceded the Mr. Big point. The
    respondent now attempts to argue on appeal that there is enough of an
    evidentiary record to conclude that the appellant’s confession would have been
    admitted had a <em>voir dire </em>been held.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent is correct that the confession
    appears to have led to the discovery of powerful inculpatory evidence: Mr.
    Gilby’s missing set of keys, which were in the storm sewer that the appellant
    led police to. This is, on its face, a persuasive indicator of the reliability
    of the confession. The defence position at trial was that the police officers coached
    the appellant on the content of the confession and that the officers led the
    appellant to the location of the keys. The appellant was simply responding to
    non-verbal clues when he directed them to the correct storm sewer. The
    appellant says that the recordings of the confession support the coaching
    theory. He called evidence which suggested that the keys would have been
    discovered much earlier, had they been deposited in the storm sewer when the
    appellant said they were. Given my conclusion on the abuse of process concerns
    and the fact that the record is incomplete on this issue, it is not necessary to
    comment on the reliability of the appellant’s confession, other than to say
    that the evidentiary record on this point is incomplete.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police conduct in Project Gale raised
    serious concerns about abuse of process. The appellant was an alcoholic. He had
    anxiety and depression that he was taking medication for, and at least one
    recent instance of suicidal ideation. He eked out an existence on disability
    benefits. He drank and smoked marijuana regularly and had to leave his
    disability cheques with a trustee out of fear that he would not be able to
    afford his living expenses due to his substance consumption.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When Det. Hopiavuori appeared as a new friend,
    the appellant’s life became easier. He suddenly had a network of people he
    cared for, and who appeared to care for him. Det. Hopiavuori regularly bought
    him food and alcohol. He received cash from the organization. The amounts may
    not seem like a lot of money for most, but the appellant was a man scraping by
    on his benefits. In eight months, he incurred $585 worth of debt and repaid
    $440. Over that same period, the organization paid the appellant about $910.
    During the time before the appellant’s stroke, Det. Hopiavuori spent $260 on
    alcohol for the two of them and whoever else was around. In total, he spent
    over $970 on alcohol and almost $1,900 on food during the operation. He spent
    around $160 on other expenses, including the walker, clothes, and a haircut for
    the appellant. The fictitious organization also spent $837.88 on hotels for the
    appellant. As Det. Polly acknowledged, the money was a lot for the appellant. Perhaps
    most importantly, he was also made to feel useful and valued by the
    organization, which began to give him tasks in this apparently criminal
    enterprise.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Up until the point of the appellant’s stroke in
    August 2014, the circumstances of Operation Gale, although still concerning, may
    not have been much different from many Mr. Big operations. However, from that
    point on, the police conduct raised even more significant concerns. As the
    appellant submits, Det. Hopiavuori took on a caregiving role in addition to a
    friendship role. Det. Hopiavuori visited him in the hospital; purchased things
    for him, including a walker and a TV; and picked up his medication. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This chronology reveals a significantly
    increased level of dependence and vulnerability on the part of the appellant
    after he suffered the stroke. While the evidence of Dets. Polly and Hopiavuori
    was that they were merely looking after him so that he would be able to
    continue in Operation Gale, it is clear that this also fostered a relationship
    of increased dependency on the part of the appellant. The appellant was even
    more vulnerable than he had been before the stroke. They accommodated his
    physical constraints by limiting his role to that of lookout. He testified that
    when he expressed some surprise at this, he was told that he was valued because
    he was smart. They also took him to a hotel and paid so he could bathe which he
    was unable to do, at least initially, at home. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was during this period that the police
    increased the pressure on him. They pulled the appellant and Det. Hopiavuori
    over and seized what the police convinced the appellant were thousands of
    dollars worth of cigarettes. Under this pressure, Det. Neufeld purportedly came
    up with a plan that would relieve that pressure and provide the appellant’s
    friend, Det. Lemaich, with a way to support his family. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Then, in the final days before the confession, the
    appellant’s Red Cross worker did not show. The police staged an elaborate
    operation, where it appeared that his apartment was swarmed by police. When Det.
    Hopiavuori and the appellant saw the police cruisers, the appellant wanted to
    speak to the police and clear things up. The appellant also wanted to retrieve
    his medication. Det. Hopiavuori refused and convinced the appellant to leave. They
    ended up back at a hotel. During the time at the hotel, Det. Hopiavuori
    increasingly pressured the appellant to confess. Most concerning of all, the
    appellant did not have his medication for the entire time at the hotel. By the
    time he confessed, he was a mess, mentally. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In summary, the appellant was extremely
    vulnerable and came to depend on Det. Hopiavuori: he had very little money and
    lacked a social network; he had documented mental health issues, including
    addition to alcohol; by the time of his confession, he had significant physical
    health issues; and he was off his medication for three days in the lead-up to
    his confession. The appellant’s vulnerabilities were exploited, consciously or
    not, by the operation: the police officers provided him with money; they made
    him feel valued; they provided him food and alcohol; they were invaluable to
    the appellant while he was recovering from his stroke; and they actively
    prevented the appellant from obtaining medication right before the confession. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These are serious issues and it is by no means
    obvious that the confession would have survived the scrutiny of a <em>voir dire</em>.
    As the appellant states, it is highly arguable that the police conduct in this
    case would shock the conscience of the community. I stress that these
    statements were presumptively inadmissible, and the onus was on the Crown to
    show otherwise.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A search of the post-<em>Hart </em>case law
    indicates that very few Mr. Big confessions have been excluded because the
    police conduct amounted to an abuse of process, despite Moldaver J.’s comments
    that the doctrine must be reinvigorated to guard against abusive police
    conduct. It appears that the doctrine of abuse of process might still “be
    somewhat of a paper tiger”, especially in cases like the case at bar, where the
    accused was not threatened with overt or implied violence: <em>Hart</em>, at
    para. 79. This is despite Moldaver J.’s comments, at paras. 78, 114, that
    police conduct must be carefully scrutinized in light of the obvious “risk that
    the police will go too far”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The promise of a “reinvigorated” abuse of
    process doctrine must not be an empty one. The facts of this case demonstrate
    that there is an ever-present risk that the police might go too far. It is the
    court’s role to provide for an “effective mechanism for monitoring the conduct
    of the undercover officers who engage in these operations” and to “protect
    against abusive state conduct”: <em>Hart</em>, at paras. 79-80. That did not
    happen in this case. These comments should not be taken to suggest that a
    particular result must be reached in a new trial of this matter. Instead, they
    are intended to signal to the courts more broadly that they must seriously
    consider the applicability of the abuse of process doctrine in cases of this
    nature.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Because of my conclusion on the admissibility of
    the confession, it is not necessary to decide whether the jury charge was adequate
    because a jury charge presupposes that the confession was properly admitted.
    Moreover, had a <em>voir dire</em> been conducted, additional evidence may have
    been admitted, thus affecting the necessary content of the charge. It may be
    useful, however, to restate a few applicable principles. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, and most importantly, even if a
    confession obtained through a Mr. Big operation is determined to reach the
    admissibility threshold at a proper <em>voir dire </em>and is admitted into
    evidence, the issues about reliability and potential for prejudice identified
    in <em>Hart </em>are not eliminated. These evidentiary issues must still be
    mitigated at the jury instruction stage of the trial: <em>Mack</em>, para. 44.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the jury charge fell well
    short of the guidelines in <em>Mack</em>. Specifically, the jury charge did not
    address specific reliability concerns associated with Mr. Big confessions and
    it did not review the circumstances relevant to the confession. As a result, it
    did not properly caution the jury about the reliability concerns in the
    confession.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent argues that the jury charge was
    adequate. The charge as a whole accorded with the requirements of <em>Mack</em>.
    He argues that a more detailed charge about the circumstances of the confession
    would not have assisted the defence, because it would have included a list of
    evidence that confirmed the reliability of the confession.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is well established that an accused is
    entitled to a properly, but not perfectly, instructed jury: <em>Mack</em>, at
    para. 48. An adequate jury charge must caution the jury about the two
    evidentiary concerns raised by Mr. Big confessions: the risk that the
    confession may be unreliable and the fact that any confession is accompanied by
    bad character evidence. These concerns do not disappear after the confession is
    admitted: <em>Mack</em>, at para. 44. The details of this evidence will,
    obviously, inform the specific content of the instructions to be given to the
    jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There is no magic formula for a jury instruction in Mr. Big cases. However,
    with respect to the reliability concerns, the trial judge should highlight that
    the reliability of the confession is a question for the jury: <em>Mack</em>, at
    para. 52. The trial judge should alert the jury to several factors relevant in
    assessing the  reliability of the confession, including “the length of the
    operation, the number of interactions between the police and the accused, the
    nature of the relationship between the undercover officers and the accused, the
    nature and extent of the inducements offered, the presence of any threats, the
    conduct of the interrogation itself, and the personality of the accused”: <em>Mack</em>,
    at para. 52. The trial judge should also discuss any markers of reliability
    that the confession contains. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Because there was no <em>voir dire</em> held in this case, it is not
    useful to parse the trial judge’s charge beyond setting out these general
    principles. Depending on the <em>voir dire</em>, there may be more or less
    evidence adduced at trial in relation to the reliability of any statements or
    confession admitted. </span></p>
