  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>In Ontario, parties injured
    in an automobile accident can receive “no fault” first-party benefits through receipt
    of statutory accident benefits (“SABs”). SABs are required by statute to be
    included in all automobile insurance policies. They provide a person injured in
    an accident, whether or not they are at fault, access to medical, rehabilitation,
    and other benefits to assist with their recovery.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>An injured person may also
    bring a legal action against the “at fault” driver in tort (“the tort defendant”).
    There is often overlap between the compensation provided pursuant to the SABs
    and the award of damages in a civil proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Section 267.8 of the <em>Insurance
    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, therefore provides that tort awards must be
    reduced by corresponding categories of SABs received. This is accomplished by deducting
    those SABs received before trial from the damages awarded and by either holding
    in trust those SABs received after trial or by assigning the SABs benefits payable
    after trial to the tortfeasor or his insurer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The appellant, Kossay
    El-Khodr, suffered catastrophic injuries in a motor vehicle accident. Royal
    &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Company of Canada (“Royal”) is Mr. El-Khodr’s SABs
    insurer. The respondent, Northbridge Commercial Insurance Company
    (“Northbridge”), is the insurer for the tort defendant and conducted the
    defence on the tortfeasor’s behalf.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The jury awarded Mr.
    El-Khodr substantial damages payable by the tortfeasor. Northbridge, as insurer
    for the tortfeasor, sought an assignment of certain accident benefits payable by
    Royal to Mr. El-Khodr. While the trial judge assigned some benefits, the
    assignment of benefits for future medication and assistive devices and future professional
    services was denied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Northbridge appealed the decision
    (“the Assignment Appeal”) to this court. After the Assignment Appeal was heard
    but before reasons were released, Royal, Northbridge, and Mr. El-Khodr entered
    into Minutes of Settlement. Under the minutes of settlement, Royal settled
    $385,000 into a trust for the benefit of the appellant and Northbridge in “full
    and final satisfaction of any and all entitlement to medical and
    rehabilitations benefits.” The Minutes of Settlement provided, as set out in
    detail below, that this sum would be held by Hughes Amys LLP, counsel to Northbridge,
    and released either to Mr. El-Khodr or Northbridge depending on the outcome of
    the Assignment Appeal. Specifically, Northbridge would receive the funds “in
    the event that the said appeal is allowed and an assignment of Kossay El-Khodr’s
    entitlement to medical and rehabilitation benefits is granted to Northbridge.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>In September 2017, the Assignment
    Appeal was granted and this court ordered that the amounts payable by Royal to
    Mr. El-Khodr for future medication and assistive devices, and for professional
    services for specified benefits up to the amount of the jury award, be assigned
    to Northbridge: see <em>El-Khodr v. Lackie</em>, 2017 ONCA 716, 139 O.R. (3d)
    659, leave to appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 461.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The application judge was asked
    to interpret the Minutes of Settlement in light of the Assignment Appeal and determine
    whether the preconditions for the transfer of funds to Northbridge in the
    Minutes of Settlement were satisfied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Mr. El-Khodr argued that
    this court, in the Assignment Appeal, did not order the “assignment of Mr.
    El-Khodr’s entitlement of medical and rehabilitation benefits” as it assigned
    only part of those benefits and, as such, the second precondition to the
    transfer of funds was not satisfied. The application judge rejected this
    approach and held that the conditions set out in the Minutes of Settlement were
    met. She therefore ordered that the $385,000 amount in the Settlement Agreement
    be released to Northbridge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Mr. El-Khodr appeals the
    application judge’s order to transfer the $385,000 to Northbridge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>For the reasons that follow,

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The issue on this appeal is
    whether the application judge made a palpable and overriding error of fact or an
    extricable error of law in failing to properly construe the preconditions for
    payment to Northbridge in the Minutes of Settlement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>In order to assess whether
    the application judge erred in her interpretation of the Minutes of Settlement,
    it is necessary to understand (a) the available approaches to the assignment of
    the SABs benefits, (b) the background facts and terms of the Minutes of
    Settlement (c) the decision of this court on the Assignment Appeal and (d) the
    reasons of the application judge.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>In Ontario, <em>Statutory
    Accident Benefits Schedule,</em> O. Reg. 34/10, under the<em> Insurance Act</em>,
    enables parties injured in an automobile accident to receive no-fault first-party

lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Because of the overlap
    between the compensation provided pursuant to the SABs and the damage awards,
    s. 267.8 of the <em>Insurance Act</em> provides that the tort award must be
    reduced by corresponding categories of SABs received. Section 278.8(12) addresses
    the assignment of SABs payable after trial and provides as follows:</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Until the decisions in <em>Carroll

    to refused, [2019] S.C.C.A. No. 63, courts applied two different methods to address
    the overlap between damages awarded and SABs received: (a) the “apples-to-apples”
    or “strict matching” approach, which required temporal and qualitative matching
    of SABs to specific heads of tort damages; and, (b) the “silo” approach, which
    only includes three broad categories of SABs under the <em>Insurance Act</em>:
    income replacement benefits, health care benefits, and other pecuniary losses.
    Under the “silo” approach, tort damages are only required to match generally
    with a corresponding SABs category.</span></p>

    companion appeals, a five-member panel of this court adopted the “silo”
    approach to the treatment and matching of SABs to tort damages under section
    267.8 of the <em>Insurance Act</em>. The panel held that the “strict matching”
    approach, developed in <em>Bannon v. McNeely</em> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 659
    (C.A.), was no longer to be followed. One of the stated benefits of the silo
    approach was that it would promote greater efficiency in motor vehicle accident
    litigation.</span></p>

    held, at paras. 60-61 and 75-80, that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The court is required only to match statutory
    benefits that fall generally into the “silos” created by s. 267.8 of the <em>Insurance
    Act</em> with the tort heads of damage. Income awards are to be reduced only by
    SABs payments in respect of income loss and health care awards only by SABs
    payments in respect of health care expenses. The latter item is, I suggest,
    deliberately broad enough to cover all manner of expenses that relate to health
    care and would include medications, physiotherapy, psychology sessions,
    assistive devices and the like. All manner of other expenses that are covered
    by SABs and that do not fall under the income category or the health care
    category fall into the “other pecuniary losses” category.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[A]lthough the legislation requires us to
    match apples with apples, the relevant categories of “apples” are the statute’s
    categories, not the common law’s….</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>All of the claims in this case that make up
    the awards for future professional service and future medication and assistive
    devices were itemized sufficiently and all were covered by the SABs schedule</span></u><span
lang=EN-CA>. They were claimed from the date of trial to the end of the
    respondent’s life – the same period that the SABs will cover. The Cost of
    Future Care schedules on which the respondent advanced his case before the jury
    and that were made exhibits, set out the respondent’s claims in detail.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>This was not a lump sum award for future care.
    The jury awarded an amount for future attendant care/assisted living, a
    separate amount for future professional services and separate amounts for
    future housekeeping/home maintenance and for future medication and assistive
    devices.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent did not recover all of the
    amounts that he had claimed. For example, he advanced a claim for the cost of
    future professional services in the amount of $637,125 and the jury awarded
    $424,550.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>But it is for the jury to say what the proper
    amount of compensation is for a plaintiff. And once the judgment based on that
    award is paid, a plaintiff has been fully compensated for his loss. This
    plaintiff was paid the full amount of his judgment on August 10, 2015, and has,
    therefore, been fully compensated in respect of all his losses arising from
    this motor vehicle accident.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If there is no trust or assignment in respect
    of the SABs to which he will be entitled and which he will receive in the
    future for medication, assistive devices and professional services, he will be
    over-compensated and his receipt of any such benefits with no obligation to
    account to the tort insurer will constitute double recovery – a result this
    legislative scheme was specifically designed to avoid.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, <u>the trial judge erred in not
    ordering that there be an assignment in relation to the awards for the cost of
    future medication and assistive devices and future professional services</u>. I
    would set aside paragraphs 3 and 4 of the trial judge’s order of August 26,
    2015 and in their place order that any amounts for future medication and
    assistive devices payable by RSA Insurance to the respondent be assigned to
    Northbridge Commercial Insurance Corporation until the sum of $82,429 has been
    received; and that any amounts for future professional services payable by RSA
    to the respondent for psychological, physiotherapy, occupational therapy,
    massage therapy, kinesiology/personal training, case management services, and
    travel to medical or other specialist be assigned to Northbridge Commercial
    Insurance Corporation until the sum of $424,550 has been received.… [Emphasis

    Assignment of all future ‘health care expenses’…” While more precision might
    have been applied to both phrases, it is evident from reading the two documents

    grant Northbridge an assignment of Mr. El-Khodr’s entitlement to future

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. El-Khodr made the point that his

    not ultimately assigned to Northbridge by the Court of Appeal, including a rent
    subsidy. He argued that it would be unfair for Northbridge to receive the entire

    compensated in respect of all of his losses arising from his motor vehicle

    is consistent with the reasoning of this court on the Assignment Appeal. When assigning
    the medication and assistive devices and professional services benefits to
    Northbridge up to the amount of the jury award, this court recognized, at
    paras. 78-79, that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[I]t is for the jury to say what the proper
    amount of compensation is for a plaintiff. And once the judgment based on that
    award is paid, a plaintiff has been fully compensated for his loss. This
    plaintiff was paid the full amount of his judgment on August 10, 2015, and has,
    therefore, been fully compensated in respect of all his losses arising from
    this motor vehicle accident.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If there is no trust or assignment … he will
    be over-compensated and his receipt of any such benefits with no obligation to
    account to the tort insurer will constitute double recovery – a result this
    legislative scheme was specifically designed to avoid.</span></p>

    the appeal in this case in 2017, held that “strict qualitative and temporal
    matching requirements should not be applied” in deciding which benefits to
    assign, the relevant categories are “the statute’s categories not the common
    law’s” and the strict matching approach in <em>Bannon v. McNealy</em> “may no
    longer be good law in this province”.</span></p>

    application judge did not fail to take into account a precondition in the
    Minutes of Settlement and thereby make an error of law, nor did she make a palpable
    and overriding error of fact in construing the preconditions for payment to
    Northbridge in the Minutes of Settlement. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
