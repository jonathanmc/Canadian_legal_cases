    of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction before a judge and jury on counts
    of sexual interference and sexual assault of his stepdaughter. He says that the
    trial judge made the following reversible errors:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='
text-align:justify;'>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She erred in
    ruling that certain post-incident evidence should be admitted; </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='text-align:justify;'>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She erred in
    failing to instruct the jury to disregard an improper aspect of the Crown’s closing
    which suggested that the complainant’s behavioural issues were related to the
    sexual abuse by the appellant;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='
text-align:justify;'>c.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She erred in
    refusing to exclude photographs of the defendant and the complainant taken in
    her bedroom on grounds that it violated s. 8 of the <i>Canadian </i><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</span></em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no merit to any of these grounds for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Post-Incident Conduct</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s adult daughter was a witness at the trial. She testified
    that during a visit with the appellant while he was in custody after being
    charged, the appellant had asked her to destroy a black bag containing the
    complainant’s clothing which he had left in an outbuilding near the family’s
    home. The Crown brought a pre-trial motion asking that this evidence be
    admitted as it was after-the-fact conduct relevant to an issue at trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no dispute as to the relevance of the evidence to the
    allegations. It was anticipated that there would be evidence led that the
    appellant had bought his stepdaughter see-through clothing that he asked her to
    wear with nothing on underneath while her mother was absent. The heart of the
    appellant’s submissions on appeal is that the trial judge erred in failing to
    weigh the probative value of this evidence against its prejudicial effect. He
    argues that the prejudicial effect was high because, in his view, a jury would
    be likely to assume that the daughter was telling the truth unless there was
    evidence of motivation on her part to lie. While the appellant’s counsel was of
    the view that there was such motivation, this was evidence that was bad
    character evidence, including evidence that the appellant physically abused his
    children, that he had abducted them and spirited them out of their home country
    illegally, and that he had reacted very negatively when his daughter “came out”
    to him. This reality put the appellant in an “untenable” position because he
    was faced with the choice of addressing the daughter’s evidence on its own
    terms, or introducing bad character evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree. As the appellant conceded, the evidence was highly
    probative in the circumstances. In her ruling allowing the Crown’s application,
    the trial judge correctly instructed herself on the applicable principles of
    the law, and there is no suggestion that her instructions to the jury erred
    with respect to the treatment of post-incident conduct. The appellant
    cross-examined the witness extensively on her motivation to lie due to her
    father’s reaction to her coming out, and to her report of having been sexually
    assaulted on one occasion. In addition, the appellant and the appellant’s wife
    were both rigorously cross-examined on discrepancies between their respective
    testimonies as to where the black bag was found. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, we see no error. As the trial judge correctly held, it was up
    to the jury to decide whether the appellant had asked his daughter to find and
    destroy the bag. The material question was whether the appellant had made this
    request. The defence made strategic decisions as to what factors it brought out
    that could constitute motives to lie on the daughter’s part and rigorously
    cross-examined her on them. There was no basis for excluding this evidence as
    submitted by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Crown’s Closing Submission</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant takes issue with the Crown’s comment in its closing to the
    jury that the complainant’s behaviour after the summer during which the alleged
    incidents took place “made sense” because it was “more in keeping with that
    summer she had after being sexually assaulted.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant claims that this statement was entirely speculative,
    prejudicial, and rendered the trial unfair. We disagree. First of all, we note
    that the defence closing also contained statements that arguably invited
    speculation in the other direction. More importantly, there was no objection
    from Mr. Reid, who was also the trial counsel. This is particularly striking given
    that following the charge to the jury, counsel asked for, and the trial judge
    made, some clarifying instruction to the jury. He did not raise the issue of
    the closing. Closing submissions are to be given significant latitude, and the
    trial judge’s charge was balanced in that it included a fair summary of both
    sides’ positions. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The s. 8 Argument</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant submitted in his factum that the trial judge
    erred in ruling that the circumstances of the delivery of certain photos to the
    police did not violate his s. 8 rights. The photos had been inadvertently found
    by the appellant’s daughter on her (disabled) sister’s tablet, and the daughter
    who found them downloaded them so they could be provided to the police. The
    trial judge made her finding on the basis that that the daughter who provided
    the photos to the police was acting as an independent actor and not as a state
    agent, and that those actions were not subject to s. 8 scrutiny. We see no
    error in this conclusion and no merit in this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
