  <p><strong><span lang=EN-CA>By the Court:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, OZ Merchandising Inc. (“OZ
    Merchandising”) appeals from the dismissal of its action against the respondents,
    Eastern Ontario District Soccer Association (“EODSA”), the Ontario Soccer
    Association (“OSA”), and the Canadian Soccer Association (“CSA”). In the event
    that the main appeal fails, OZ Merchandising seeks leave to appeal the costs
    order made by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The court did not call on the respondents to
    address any of the submissions made by the appellant on its appeal from the
    dismissal of the action. The court dismissed that appeal with reasons to
    follow. After hearing argument on the costs appeal, the court reserved judgment.
    We have concluded leave to appeal from that order should be granted but the
    appeal should be dismissed. These reasons address both our dismissal of the
    main appeal, and the dismissal of the costs appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>the main appeal</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This lawsuit began in 2004. There is no need to
    chronicle its lengthy procedural history. The trial judge provided a brief
    summary in her Costs Decision, at para. 8. By the time the action reached trial
    in 2019, there was only one plaintiff, the appellant OZ Merchandising, and
    three defendants, the respondents, before the court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial proceeded before a jury for about seven
    weeks. However, the trial judge struck the jury as a consequence of what she
    determined to be numerous serious improprieties in counsel for the appellant’s
    closing argument to the jury: <em>OZ Merchandising Inc. v. Canadian
    Professional Soccer League Inc.</em>, 2019 ONSC 3882. There is no appeal from
    the decision striking the jury.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s claims against the respondents
    arose out of three discrete events. We need not review the evidence in detail.
    The factual context for the claims is succinctly described by the trial judge
    in the first paragraph of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The Ottawa Wizards were a soccer club in the
    Canadian Professional Soccer League (“CPSL”) from 2001 to 2003. Their home
    stadium was the OZ Optics Stadium in Carp, Ontario. In the fall 2003, three
    events occurred. First, in September, the Ottawa Wizards applied to the Ontario
    Soccer Association (“OSA”) to host the OZ Optics Invitational Tournament; the
    application was not approved, and the proposed tournament was not held. Second,
    in November, the Canadian Soccer Association (“CSA”) issued International
    Transfer Certificates (“ITCs”) for two Ottawa Wizards players, Peter Mponda and
    Macdonald Yobe, which resulted in Mr. Mponda and Mr. Yobe returning to Malawi.
    Third, in December, the Eastern Ontario District Soccer Association (“EODSA”)
    publicized that OZ Dome Sports Club had not applied to operate an indoor league
    during the 2003-2004 season and described the potential consequences of
    participating in “unsanctioned competition” at the OZ Dome facilities.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>OZ Merchandising claimed against each respondent,
    alleging negligence and intentional interference with the economic interests of
    OZ Merchandising (referred to by the trial judge as the “unlawful means”
    claim).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge dismissed the negligence claims as
    against each respondent. In respect of each of the three events giving rise to
    the negligence claims, the trial judge found:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>OZ Merchandising failed to show any of the
    respondents owed it a duty of care;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>if a duty of care existed, there was no basis
    upon which to find any of the respondents breached that duty of care; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>if a duty of care existed, and if there was a
    breach of that duty of care, OZ Merchandising had failed to prove any damages: Reasons,
    at paras. 9-11.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In respect of the intentional interference with
    economic interest claim, the trial judge concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>there was no evidence any of the respondents
    intended to cause economic harm to OZ Merchandising; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>there was no evidence any of the respondents
    committed an unlawful act against a third party; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>OZ Merchandising failed to prove any damages: Reasons,
    at paras. 10-11.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In summary, the trial judge concluded OZ
    Merchandising had failed to establish any of the essential elements necessary
    to prove either of the claims it advanced against the respondents. To the
    extent the appeal turns on alleged errors made by the trial judge in her analysis
    of the claims, the appellant can succeed only if it demonstrates errors in
    respect of all three elements of the negligence claim, or all three elements of
    the “unlawful means” claim.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>the scope of the appeal</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is unfortunately necessary to comment on the
    manner in which this appeal has been perfected and presented. The Notice of
    Appeal and Amended Notice of Appeal list dozens of grounds of appeal. The
    appellant’s factum on the appeal addresses several, but far from all of the
    grounds of appeal referred to in the Notice of Appeal and Amended Notice of
    Appeal. In oral argument, counsel addressed some, but not all of the grounds argued
    in the factum.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also brought what it styled as a “fresh
    evidence” application. On the application, the appellant filed a three-volume motion
    record and a factum. The motion record contained two affidavits, one from a
    paralegal who worked for the appellant and had some involvement in the trial,
    and the other from Mr. Omur Sezerman, the President of the appellant, a former
    plaintiff and the person directing the litigation on behalf of the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A review of the affidavits, the attachments to
    the affidavits, and the factum, reveals that the vast majority of the supposed
    “fresh evidence” is, in reality, argument based on the trial record. The
    material advances arguments, almost all of which were made at trial, often more
    than once, and rejected by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant sought leave to file a factum of
    some 500 pages. On the motion, the appellant indicated its factum could be
    reduced to about 125 pages. Leave to file a factum of that length was denied. A
    further appeal to a panel was dismissed. We agree with counsel for the respondents’
    submission that the “fresh evidence” material presently before the court is a
    transparent attempt to avoid both the 30-page limit on facta prescribed by a Practice
    Direction of this court, and the orders of this court refusing leave to file an
    extended factum: <em>OZ Merchandising Inc. v. Canadian Professional Soccer
    League Inc.</em>, 2020 ONCA 532, aff’d. 2020 ONCA 659.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the circumstances, it would be appropriate to
    refuse to address the grounds of appeal arising from the trial record but
    disguised by the appellant as part of a “fresh evidence” application. We will,
    however, address the merits of two of those arguments. One alleges bias by the
    trial judge, and the other alleges ineffective assistance by trial counsel. We
    will address these issues because they affect matters relevant to the proper administration
    of justice. The appellant’s disregard of the rules and orders of this court can
    be addressed in the context of our determination of the costs of the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Apart from the bias and ineffective assistance
    of counsel claims, we have considered the grounds of appeal raised and argued
    by the appellant in its factum and, or in its oral argument.</span></p>

    showed OZ Optics as the owner. The appellant argues the trial judge put too

    expressly contemplates a plaintiff moving for judgment against a defaulting
    defendant “before a judge”. The Rule also provides that the judge may “order
    that the action proceed to trial”. These rules give a judge the discretion to
    hear a motion for judgment, and a discretion to order the matter to trial. Neither

    respondents dismissing the action should be set aside because the appellant had

    the private interests of the litigants and requires that an appellant be
    permitted to raise the competence of its trial counsel as a ground for setting
    aside the trial judgment. The claim advanced by the appellant against the
    respondents is a straightforward negligence claim seeking damages for pure
    economic loss. Nothing in the nature of this case justifies permitting the

    trial counsel for abiding by the trial judge’s rulings, rather than following Mr.
    Sezerman’s instructions to the contrary. Abiding by a trial judge’s rulings,

    For example, Mr. Sezerman repeatedly argues trial counsel was negligent in
    making certain admissions on the pre-trial motion concerning the default
    judgment proceedings and the scope of the trial. The admissions made by counsel
    were reasonable and consistent with the applicable procedural and evidentiary law.
    The trial judge would inevitably have ruled as she did regardless of what

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s arguments based on the trial
    judge’s conduct, both at trial and in his affidavit, come down largely to the
    assertion that the trial judge made so many errors, which had such a negative
    impact on the appellant’s case, that the trial judge must have been biased
    against the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The submission rests on two false premises. First,
    adverse rulings, even rulings which are subsequently held to be wrong by a
    higher court, do not demonstrate bias. Second, the appellant has failed to
    demonstrate any substantive error in the rulings, or any unfairness in the
    process followed by the trial judge in rendering her rulings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Perhaps the best example of the misconceived
    nature of the bias allegations can be found in the appellant’s repeated
    insistence that the trial judge’s pre-trial ruling as to the scope of the trial
    effectively “gutted” the appellant’s case. The appellant alleges the ruling
    demonstrates bias, both because it was erroneous and because of its disastrous impact
    on the appellant’s case. In fact, the trial judge’s ruling did no more than
    limit the appellant to the case as pleaded, a limitation which applies to all
    litigants. As explained in our earlier reasons, she made no legal error in
    doing so, and regardless of what Mr. Sezerman may believe, her ruling imposed
    no procedural unfairness on the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Put bluntly, Mr. Sezerman refuses to accept
    either the correctness of the trial judge’s rulings, or that they were made in
    good faith. Mr. Sezerman will believe what he chooses to believe. However, he
    has failed to show any error in the rulings and has failed to rebut the strong
    presumption in favour of judicial impartiality.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s submission that the trial
    judge’s ruling striking the jury provides evidence of bias is a second example of
    the fundamental flaw in the appellant’s approach to the bias claim. The
    appellant submits that in striking the jury, the trial judge simply adopted and
    echoed the submissions made by the respondents. The appellant claims this parroting
    of the respondents’ submissions demonstrates judicial bias.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the appellant claims the trial judge’s
    ruling striking the jury demonstrates the trial judge’s bias, the appellant did
    not challenge the correctness of that ruling in its factum. Consequently, even if
    the trial judge simply repeated the respondents’ submissions (an unfair and
    inaccurate characterization of her reasons), the appellant did not allege those
    arguments led the trial judge to improperly strike the jury. How can accepting
    and even repeating meritorious arguments demonstrate judicial bias?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In many respects, the bias allegations are
    redundant to the appellant’s case on appeal. The bias allegations assume the
    trial judge made serious and repeated errors during the trial. If those assumptions
    had merit, the appellant would succeed on the appeal by virtue of having
    demonstrated the serious errors without recourse to any bias allegation. On the
    other hand, if as we have concluded, the arguments alleging serious errors by
    the trial judge have no merit, the bias claim, as framed by the appellant,
    loses most of its force.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to alleging the trial judge’s
    rulings demonstrated bias, the appellant maintains that the trial judge’s
    facial expressions and body language also indicated bias against the appellant.
    The appellant relied on affidavits filed on the trial in support of this claim.
    Those affidavits were filed by Mr. Sezerman, his wife, and an articling
    student.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These allegations are vague. Absent some
    manifestation of this alleged conduct in the record, or some other form of
    confirmatory evidence, it is difficult to ascribe much weight to a partisan’s subjective
    interpretations of a trial judge’s facial expressions or “body language”. These
    kinds of allegations alone cannot rebut the strong presumption in favour of
    judicial impartiality.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also points to the number of
    rulings made against the appellant in the course of the trial as evidence of
    bias. A mere counting of the rulings for and against a party to a trial
    provides little insight into the fairness of the trial. In addition, the number
    of the rulings made against the appellant is accounted for, to a significant
    degree, by the appellant’s refusal to abide by the trial judge’s rulings, and
    its insistence on litigating over and over again some of the same issues.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant further submits the trial judge’s
    reference to Mr. Sezerman as the “puppet master” in her costs decision provides
    further evidence of bias. We disagree. The respondents were seeking costs
    against Mr. Sezerman personally. It was their position he personally controlled
    the litigation to the extent that he should be held personally responsible for
    aspects of the litigation, which on the respondents’ submissions justified
    increased costs. The trial judge was required to make a finding as to the role
    played by Mr. Sezerman.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Her finding that Mr. Sezerman was indeed in full
    control of the litigation, even to the point of directing counsel as to what
    submissions should be made in closing and what questions should be put to
    witnesses, was supported on the record. The phrase “puppet master” is apt given
    her findings.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Sezerman complains about the impartiality of
    other judges in the Ottawa region. He refers to an earlier case in which a
    judge described him as “bellicose”. He also relies on an appearance before
    another judicial officer in Ottawa, who described herself as “the fairest
    person in this place that is going to give you a proper hearing”. Mr. Sezerman
    interprets this remark as an indication that “the judges and other personnel in
    the Ottawa court system would not be fair to me”. Finally, Mr. Sezerman refers
    to the events surrounding the recusal of the judge initially assigned to
    conduct this trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>None of the events referred to by Mr. Sezerman
    offer any basis upon which a reasonable person could perceive institutional
    bias among the Ottawa judiciary toward Mr. Sezerman.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The case in which the trial judge described Mr.
    Sezerman as “bellicose” was entirely unrelated to this case and occurred some
    ten years earlier. A single word in an entirely unrelated proceeding offers no
    basis upon which a reasonable and informed observer could conclude Ottawa
    judges were biased against the appellant. Nor does Mr. Sezerman’s success on
    appeal in that case offer any support for the bias claim. In allowing the
    appeal in part, the Court of Appeal was not critical of the trial judge or her
    use of the word “bellicose”: see <em>Oz Optics Limited v. Timbercon, Inc</em>.,
    2010 ONSC 310, rev’d 2011 ONCA 714.</span></p>

    connotation ascribed to it by Mr. Sezerman.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lastly, the recusal of the judge initially
    assigned to conduct the trial provides no support for a bias allegation.
    Counsel for the respondents learned that the judge initially assigned to the
    trial had previously been a partner at a law firm, that acted for one of the
    respondents. Counsel brought this to the attention of the court and a new trial
    judge was assigned.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that while the assignment
    of the initial trial judge might seem “a simple oversight” it becomes
    “disturbing” in light of what happened after the assignment of the second trial
    judge who actually heard the trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no objective basis for Mr. Sezerman’s
    concerns. It is common place that judges who are assigned to conduct a trial
    become aware of connections to the parties or their lawyers that make it
    prudent that someone else conduct the trial. That is exactly what happened
    here. Why any of this would be “disturbing” to a reasonable observer is left
    unexplained by the appellant.</span></p>

    the trial judge took a personal dislike to him because he was an immigrant
    whose ethnic background and passion for the justice of his cause caused him to
    conduct himself in court in a manner which the trial judge considered
    inappropriate and disrespectful. Mr. Sezerman asserts he intended no
    disrespect.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is nothing in the record to support the
    suggestion that Mr. Sezerman’s ethnic background had anything to do with the
    trial judge’s rulings or conduct of the trial. Clearly, the trial judge found
    some of Mr. Sezerman’s conduct inappropriate and worthy of sanction. In several
    of her rulings, the trial judge set out in detail the conduct of Mr. Sezerman she
    found to be inappropriate and explained why that conduct was inappropriate. Some
    of the trial judge’s reasons related to Mr. Sezerman’s behaviour in court, however,
    the trial judge was primarily troubled by Mr. Sezerman’s adamant refusal to
    abide by rulings made during the trial. The trial record supports the trial
    judge’s factual findings in this regard.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge had the onerous responsibility
    of keeping this long, sometimes heated, trial on the rails. Her task was made
    all the more difficult by the presence of the jury. To do so, the trial judge
    had to insist the parties comply with her rulings and comport themselves in
    court in a manner consistent with the proper administration of justice. No
    doubt Mr. Sezerman was passionate about his cause, and no doubt he was
    dissatisfied with the way the trial was going. Neither Mr. Sezerman’s passionate
    belief in his cause, nor his firm belief the trial was not being conducted
    fairly, relieved him of his obligation to comply with the trial judge’s orders
    and control his behaviour in court. The trial judge’s insistence that Mr.
    Sezerman follow the rules or face the consequences demonstrates neither a
    personal dislike of Mr. Sezerman, nor a bias based on his ethnic background. It
    does reveal the trial judge was determined to keep the trial moving forward in
    accordance with the rules, even if the appellant was wholly dissatisfied with
    the way the trial was unfolding.</span></p>

    the trial judge’s finding that the conduct of the appellant merited an award of
    costs on a substantial indemnity basis was supportable on this record, it was
    unnecessary to the trial judge’s finding with respect to the respondents’
    entitlement to costs on a substantial indemnity basis. The trial judge had
    determined, apart from the appellant’s conduct, based on the offers to settle,

lang=EN-CA> </span>In oral argument, counsel who is alleged to have been
    incompetent at trial, and who appeared for the appellant on the appeal,
    attempted to make a statement to the court, presumably in support of the
    ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The court refused to permit counsel to
    make that statement. If counsel wanted to admit his incompetence in support of
    the appeal, his role was that of a witness, and not counsel on the appeal. The
    appellant chose not to file an affidavit from trial counsel.</p>
