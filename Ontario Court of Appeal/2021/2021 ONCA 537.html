<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Staying the decision of Justice Edward J. Koke
(“the motion judge”), dated March 15, 2021, in which he refused to set aside

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A brief chronology of the steps taken prior to
the appellant’s eviction from the property is set out below:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2012, the appellant corporation charged the
property in question for two years and secured the sum of $1.6 million with interest
payable at the rate of 8.5% per annum. Ms. Maggiacomo was the sole director of
the corporation at the time, but the charge was signed by her common-law
spouse, Mr. Haines, who has since passed away. The funds advanced by Mr. Eisen
went to pay and discharge existing mortgages registered on the property. The
charge was periodically extended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By April 2019, significant municipal tax arrears
had accumulated against the property. Mr. Eisen entered into an agreement with
Ms. Maggiacomo and her son to pay those taxes in return for making ongoing
monthly payments toward the tax arrears. There was also an agreement to extend
the charge for one year from May 15, 2019 to May 15, 2020. The tax for arrears
were paid and several payments were made by the appellant in accordance with
the agreement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;
font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>On May 15, 2020, the
charge matured but principal, interest, and expenses had not been paid. The
respondent claimed that the charge was in default by January 15, 2020 and
continues to be in default.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;
font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The respondent sent the
appellant a notice of sale and, on November 13, 2020, the respondent served the
appellant with a statement of claim for possession. Shortly thereafter, the
appellant served a notice of intent to defend. No statement of defence was
served.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>On January 15, 2021,
the respondent’s counsel requested a defence and advised that he would be
seeking immediate possession. No statement of defence was filed.</span></p>

no steps would be taken to enforce it until the motion to set aside the default
judgment was heard on March 10, 2021.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge refused to set aside the
default judgment as he was not satisfied the appellant had a plausible
explanation for the default or an arguable defence on the merits, noting that
the respondent did not receive any communication from the appellant’s counsel
until 26 days after requesting that the defence be filed immediately.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He also held that setting aside the default
judgment would result in significant prejudice to the respondent. He noted that:</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As of the oral argument of this motion, the
[respondent] had still not received confirmation that [insurance, municipal
taxed, and hydro] accounts were in good standing.</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Quite clearly, a failure to maintain these
accounts would place the [respondent’s] security in jeopardy. A day without
essential services such as hydro could expose the property to considerable risk
of damage….</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Although I sympathize with the desire of the
[appellant] corporation to refinance its building and operations, I am not
convinced that it is fair to the [respondent] to permit the corporation to do
so while continuing to place the [respondent]’s security at risk.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He concluded that:</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The defendant corporation does not dispute the
fact that the principal amount of the mortgage has been outstanding since May
15, 2020. Neither does it dispute the fact that it has failed to respond to
requests concerning the tax, insurance and hydro accounts. It has not put forth
an arguable defence to the claim and in the circumstances, it is my view that a
decision dismissing this motion will uphold the overall integrity of the
administration of justice. For the above reasons, I am dismissing the
defendant's motion to set aside the judgment.</span></p>

<p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Arguments and conclusion</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The overarching consideration in whether to
grant a stay or interlocutory injunction pending appeal is the interests of
justice: <em>Zafar v. Saiyid</em>, 2017 ONCA 919, at para. 18; <em>Circuit
World Corp. v. Lesperance</em>, 33 O.R. (3d) 674, at para. 8. The court
considers three factors: (i) a preliminary assessment must be made of the
merits of the case to ensure there is a serious question to be tried; (ii) it
must be determined whether the applicant would suffer irreparable harm if the
application were refused; and (iii) an assessment of the balance of convenience
must be made as to which of the parties would suffer greater harm from the
granting or refusal of the remedy pending a decision on the merits: see <em>M
&amp; M Homes Inc. v. 2088556 Ontario Inc.</em>, 2020 ONCA 134, 51 C.P.C. (8th)
253, at para.&nbsp;29;<i><span style='color:black'> </span><em>RJR-MacDonald
Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</em></i><span style='color:black'>, [1994] 1
S.C.R. 311, at p. 334. These factors are not watertight compartments and the
strength of one factor may compensate for weakness of another: </span><em>Zafar</em><span
style='color:black'>, at para. 18.</span></span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to this litigation, the parties are
involved in several other matters before the courts. Ms. Maggiacomo claims she
is concerned that “private and confidential information related to various
ongoing litigation” has been “removed and destroyed.” She also claims that:</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Unless immediate relief is obtained by the
court, allowing me to access the Property to ensure the integrity of financial
information, confidential information and other important assets, my interests
will be irreparably harmed and evidence relating to the underlying action
subject to appeal another ongoing litigation may be destroyed.</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I have important documents concerning the
ownership of the Property, email communications between the deceased [i.e. Mr.
Haines] and his counsel, personal and corporate financial records, and letters
to my counsel. There are other documents I have been able to retrieve since the
start of litigation through my family's own investigations and calling old
acquaintances.</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I also have computers and hard drives that
were left on at the time there is information on those computers that are
sensitive as well as emails between myself and counsel.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While I am sympathetic to Ms. Maggiacomo’s
concern about losing her personal effects and documents, the appellant has not
sought an order for return of her personal property.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her affidavit, Ms. Maggiacomo asserts that
this was her primary residence and her son was at the premises when the
eviction notice was enforced. Ms.&nbsp;Maggiacomo offered no information about
her current residence or circumstances or any information about the possible
sale of the property. I am therefore not satisfied that, on the evidence before
me, the appellant has demonstrated irreparable harm.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Secondly, with regard to the merits of the
appeal, Ms. Maggiacomo claims the motion judge erred in finding there was no
arguable defence on the merits when he refused to set aside the default
judgment.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Koke J., in his reasons, states that “[the
appellant] does not challenge the validity of the mortgage. In any event, I
expect that any defect in the execution of the original charge was likely
remedied when Ms. Maggiacomo signed the renewal of the mortgage in 2019.”</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Maggiacomo asserts that she was unaware of alleged
defects with the charge when she signed the renewal forms in April 2019. In
particular, she says she was unaware that Mr. Haines was an undischarged
bankrupt when he initially charged the property on the corporation’s behalf. On
the motion, counsel informed the court that Ms. Maggiacomo believes that she
did not sign the 2019 renewal form and that her signature was a forgery. This
argument does not appear to have been put before Koke J. and there is no
affidavit evidence in the record to this effect.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, although it is a low threshold, the
appellant’s case on the merits is not strong.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lastly, the balance of convenience favours the
respondent. The respondent is at risk of losing his security as there is a long
history of arrears.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Taken together, I am not persuaded that it is in
the interests of justice to order that Ms. Maggiacomo take repossession of the
property.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, the motion is dismissed.</span></p>
