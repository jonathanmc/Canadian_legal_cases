  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police obtained a general warrant to make
    covert entries into a storage locker used by the appellant and rented under a
    false name. The police discovered cocaine, marijuana, oxycodone, alprazolam and
    Canadian currency in the locker. The appellant was charged with possession of cocaine
    for the purpose of trafficking, possession of the proceeds of crime, and
    conspiracy to traffic cocaine.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the appellant was convicted after
    unsuccessfully applying to quash the general warrant based on s. 8 of the <em>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. Before this court, the appellant argues
    that the reviewing judge applied the wrong standard in considering whether the
    warrant was valid and that the requirements of s. 487.01 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 were not met. Moreover, the test in <em>R. v.
    Grant</em>, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353 favoured exclusion of the seized
    evidence. He asks that the warrant be quashed, the evidence obtained excluded,
    and an acquittal entered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the following reasons, I would dismiss the

lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Thunder Bay Police Service received
    information from seven confidential informants (“CIs”) that the appellant and
    two associates were selling cocaine at the Royalton Hotel in Thunder Bay. Surveillance
    was conducted which confirmed the information provided by the CIs and which led
    to a storage locker where it was believed drugs and other evidence of
    trafficking would be located. The appellant and his associates were observed in
    vehicles rented by them going to and from the storage locker and entering and
    exiting the locker with various bags.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police applied for, among other things, a
    general warrant to covertly enter and search the storage locker. In the
    information to obtain (“ITO”), Detective Constable Bartol was the affiant. He
    set forth the basis for his belief that there were reasonable grounds to
    believe that the appellant and his two associates had committed the subject
    offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>D.C. Bartol outlined information received on the
    appellant and his drug dealing activities since 2007, his arrests and charges for
    possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking in 2008 and 2011, his guilty
    plea and conviction of the former and withdrawal of charges in the latter, and
    his continued active trafficking in cocaine assisted by Romariando Meggoe, whose
    street name was “Cash”, and another unidentified male known as “Money”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Police investigation revealed that the appellant
    had rented a grey Toyota vehicle and Mr. Meggoe a black Chevrolet Malibu and a
    green Volkswagon Jetta, and the police obtained other identification
    particulars associated with the vehicles.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>D.C. Bartol described in detail the information
    obtained from the seven CIs in the summer and autumn of 2017, four of whom had
    previously provided information to the police. In addition, much of the
    information provided was corroborated by independent investigation by the
    police.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> CI No. 1 advised that the appellant, who went
    by the name “Marshall”, was in town selling cocaine with a few other black
    males. They were driving a new grey or silver car. The appellant was using a
    cell phone and his number was provided. He recruited women to sell for him and was
    the main guy selling hard and soft cocaine. CI No. 2 said that the appellant
    was back in town and dealing cocaine out of the Royalton Hotel. CI No. 3 stated
    that the appellant was back in town, using the phone number identified by CI
    No. 1, his “boy” who was black, in his 20’s, and skinny with short hair, went
    by the street name “Cash”, and CI No. 3 saw “Cash” with coke a couple of days prior.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>CI No. 4 reported that the appellant was driving
    a rented silver Toyota Camry and was usually in the company of two other black
    males, one of whom was “Cash”. The appellant had two phones, moved around and
    used hotels and met people in parking lots. CI No. 5 reported that there were
    two black guys in town who were usually at the Royalton Hotel bar dealing three
    to four times a week. They supplied drugs to friends who lived there, and two
    named individuals dealt drugs for them. They were trying to get people to sell
    cocaine for them. The owner did not want them selling in the bar, so they went
    outside to deal and did all the drug dealing behind the bar. The black guys in
    the bar had a boss named “Marshall” who was not seen in the bar very often.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>CI No. 6 reported that there were black males
    selling crack cocaine at the Royalton and that the informant had bought drugs
    from them. CI No. 6 identified a photo of Mr. Meggoe as “Cash”. CI No. 7 stated
    that two black guys from Toronto were selling coke and crack at the Royalton
    almost every day, hanging around the bar. They went by the names “Cash” and
    “Money”. “Cash” was about 5’7”, black, and skinny with short hair and a nose
    piercing. They sold crack that was prepackaged, wrapped in a plastic bag. They
    always had lots of coke on them and kept it in their pockets. They met people
    behind the building in the back lane to make the deal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>D.C. Bartol also reported on the surveillance
    conducted at the Royalton and other locations on August 23, September 7, 21,
    and 26, 2017. This revealed three black males engaging in apparent drug dealing
    activities and using the three vehicles noted. On September 21, 2017, following
    suspected drug transactions at the Royalton, a black male got into the Volkswagen
    Jetta vehicle believed to be rented by Mr. Meggoe, and drove in a manner
    consistent with attempting to lose anyone trying to follow to a residence at 25
    Melon Street. The vehicle remained for about 20 minutes and then returned to
    the Royalton Hotel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 26, 2017, the police conducted
    surveillance at 25 Melon Street where the Volkswagen Jetta was parked outside.
    A black male carrying a white “Old Navy” bag, and identified as Mr. Meggoe, exited
    the building, got into the vehicle, and drove to Nor-Shore Storage where he
    went to storage locker number 316 and placed two bags inside. He then picked up
    a female at Confederation College, drove to the Thunder Bay airport, went into
    the terminal for a period of time, exited, dropped the female off at
    Confederation College, and returned to 25 Melon Street. Thirty minutes later he
    drove to the airport again, returned the Volkswagen Jetta, and entered the
    terminal where he checked a dark bag.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 28, 2017, the police determined
    that storage locker 316 was rented to a male named Mark James who had paid cash
    and had produced a driver’s licence on July 31, 2017. However, on
    investigation, there was no person with that name and date of birth on the CPIC
    file or the MTO database.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The storage facility surveillance system on July
    31, 2017 showed a black male paying for the rental of the storage locker and
    exiting the passenger seat of the silver Toyota rented by the appellant, and on
    August 7, 2017, two men were seen exiting the same silver Toyota at storage
    locker 316 and placing a black pack sack inside.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 3, 2017, the police installed a
    camera with a clear view of the front of storage locker 316.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the reviewing judge summarized:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On October 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 17 and 19, a
    silver vehicle was observed parking near the storage locker. Black males were
    observed on these dates, often more than once on the same date, removing bags
    from the vehicle and taking them to the storage locker, and removing bags from
    the storage locker and placing them in the vehicle. On three occasions, a male
    believed to be Mr. Brown is seen exiting the driver’s side of this vehicle.
    Each visit to the locker is brief, and the door to the locker is continually
    shut behind these individuals in an effort to conceal their actions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>Armed with this
    information, D.C. Bartol outlined in the ITO why he had reasonable grounds to
    believe that evidence of drug trafficking, telecommunication devices, evidence
    of money laundering and proceeds of crime would be obtained from the storage
    locker while at the same time preserving the integrity of the investigation. He
    believed that the information provided by the CIs when taken in totality was
    compelling, credible and corroborated. Physical surveillance at the Royalton
    Hotel had provided observations consistent with hand to hand drug trafficking;
    physical and video surveillance of the storage locker had shown on numerous
    occasions that bags were placed inside and taken out of locker 316. Each stay
    at the locker was brief and the door continually pulled closed behind them.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>D.C. Bartol set
    out the objectives of the application, namely: to gather sufficient evidence of
    the full scope of the drug network, learn the stash locations, identify the
    persons assisting with drug transactions or exchanges, identify the couriers of
    drugs and money, and to seize evidence to support trafficking charges against
    the appellant, Mr. Meggoe and “Money” and any co-conspirators.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>He addressed
    the three components of s. 487.01(1), stating that he believed “that the covert
    interception of one or more of the drug shipments and currency shipments will
    provide police with evidence to further their investigation while at the same
    time preserving the integrity of the ongoing criminal investigation.” He
    expressed his belief that it was in the best interests of the administration of
    justice to issue the warrant. The investigation was ongoing and a conventional
    search warrant would by its nature likely terminate the investigation as the
    main targets would be immediately notified that they were the subject of a
    police investigation. He noted his belief that no other statutory provision
    would permit the technique contemplated by the general warrant.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>He believed that
    the appellant, Mr. Meggoe and “Money” were utilizing the storage locker to
    store the majority of the drugs and money and concluded by stating: “I believe
    that there will be further evidence collected from the storage locker that will
    further support the charges of possession for the purpose of trafficking.” He
    proposed 15 conditions and sought authorization to covertly enter and search
    the storage locker from November 9, 2017 to January 8, 2018.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>A general
    warrant was granted by the issuing judge on November 9, 2017, and on November
    22, 2017, police covertly entered and searched the storage locker, finding
    cocaine, marijuana, oxycodone, alprazolam and Canadian currency. This was the
    only entry made.</span></span></p>

    believe an offence has taken place and that evidence of a crime would be found
    in the storage locker, he stated that the standard was one of reasonable
    probability, and did not rise to the standard of proof on a balance of

    instructing himself on the law, he noted that the ITO depended on two planks:
    the information collected from CIs and the information generated directly by
    police surveillance and other investigative techniques. Neither plank was
    independently capable of justifying the grant of the warrant. The reliability
    of the police investigation, particularly with respect to the storage locker,
    was strong but the information provided by the CIs required scrutiny pursuant
    to </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Debot</span></em><span

    trustworthy, there remained the question of whether that information together
    with that collected by the police investigation objectively established the
    reasonable grounds to issue the warrant. He concluded that the CI information
    was compelling, credible and corroborated. The information was detailed in identifying
    the street names of the sellers, the location of the drug transactions, the
    vehicle descriptions, the cell phone number used by “Marshall”, that “Marshall”
    recruited women to sell the drugs, the drug packaging and pricing, and the frequency
    of the transactions. In addition, each CI provided information from August,
    September and October of 2017 and described the interactions and the

    Volkswagen Jetta involved in the suspected transactions and found to be rented by
    the appellant and Mr. Meggoe respectively, and the cell phone number associated

    held that a covert entry and search falls squarely within the meaning of an
    “investigative technique or procedure” under s. 487.01. The subsection (c) requirement
    was met in that case because no provision in any other federal statute would
    authorize an unlimited number of covert entries and searches on private
    property over a two-month period. This court, at para. 42, accepted the
    proposition put forward by Frankel J.A. in </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R.

    flexibility Parliament contemplated in creating the general warrant, while
    safeguarding against its misuse. As the facts of this case illustrate, there is
    a need for heightened judicial scrutiny where Parliament has provided an
    authorization for an investigative technique that is substantively equivalent

    reasonable grounds and that there were insufficient grounds before the issuing judge

    disclosed possibilities, not a reasonable probability that the covert entry
    into the storage locker would reveal evidence of offences as required by s.&nbsp;487.01(1)(a).
    The evidence before the issuing judge did not show that the use of a covert
    entry would produce evidence to support a charge. He asserts that the ITO
    contained conditional language such as “if controlled substances are located”,
    “should the police discover a large quantity of drugs”, and that the reviewing
    judge used phrases such as “[i]t was hoped” and “police hoped” which imply
    reservation, not likelihood.</span></span></p>

    yet the warrant was issued on November 9, 2017.</span></span></p>

    judge’s first task, which he recognized and applied, was to consider whether
    the issuing judge had a basis on which to issue the warrant: </span></span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Garofoli</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span
lang=EN-CA>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, at p. 1452. He also correctly set out the
    standard for reasonable grounds as one of reasonable probability or
    credibly-based probability: </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hunter v.
    Southam Inc.</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>,</span></span><span

class=MsoPageNumber>, at p. 1166. The reviewing judge’s use of the word “hope”
    in his reasons was in the context of summarizing some of D.C. Bartol’s evidence
    and the ITO, and it was not his articulation or application of the standard of
    reasonable probability.</span></span></p>

    detailed review, the reviewing judge was satisfied that there was a basis upon which
    the issuing judge could be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to
    support the issuance of a general warrant. Although D.C. Bartol used some
    conditional terminology, he clearly set out in the ITO that the police believed
    that drugs and other evidence of trafficking would be located in the storage
    locker. He also testified that he believed the police had reasonable and
    probable grounds for a </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Controlled Drugs and
    Substances Act</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>, S.C.
    1996, c. 19 warrant and a conventional search warrant. The reasonable and
    probable grounds were supported by the information provided from the CIs and
    the police investigation. Reviewing the ITO and D.C. Bartol’s evidence in
    totality, it is hard to see how any other conclusion could be reached.</span></span></p>

    this case, the appellant and Mr. Meggoe had been using the storage locker for
    months, since July 31, 2017. In October, the month preceding the ITO, they were
    observed accessing the storage locker at least 12 times. Although it was put to
    him multiple times in cross-examination, D.C. Bartol did not agree that it was
    “common” for drugs to be moved between stash locations to evade police or
    prevent seizure, only that it happened sometimes out of precaution. When the general
    warrant was issued on November 9, 2017, only a few weeks after the last
    observation, it was reasonable to believe that information concerning the
    offences would still be found there.</span></span></p>

    appellant submits that the reviewing judge applied the wrong legal test under
    s. 487.01(1), treated the police request as being for a conventional warrant,
    and neglected to consider all of the components of s. 487.01(1). Counsel
    particularly emphasized the failure of the reviewing judge to address the best
    interests of the administration of justice element found in s. 487.01(1)(b).</span></span></p>

    that, consistent with the submissions of counsel, the reviewing judge placed
    emphasis on the reasonable grounds requirement found in s.&nbsp;487.01(1)(a)
    and did not explicitly use the term “best interests” in his reasons. However,
    he referred to s. 487.01(1) as a whole and dealt with the issue of best
    interests in the context of the argument made before him. In submissions before
    the reviewing judge, defence counsel had argued that it would only be in the
    interests of justice to permit entry to the storage locker if there were a
    reasonable basis to believe evidence would be located there and that it was not
    in the interests of justice to go on a fishing expedition. The reviewing judge
    clearly found that there was a reasonable basis to conclude that evidence would
    be located in the storage locker, thus implicitly negating any suggestion of a
    fishing expedition.</span></span></p>

    judge expressly addressed the third element or “no other provision authorizing”
    element of s. 487.01(1) noting that D.C. Bartol had stated that “there were no
    other Acts of Parliament or provisions in the </span></span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA> that would authorize a warrant permitting the techniques or procedures needed
    to conduct this particular investigation.” This lends further credence to the
    conclusion that the reviewing judge did not overlook the three elements of s. 487.01(1)
    including the best interests requirement. Although it would have been
    preferable if the reviewing judge had expressly referenced this element, reading
    his reasons as a whole, he implicitly considered the best interests of justice.
    As he stated at p. 23:</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>The CIs and the
    information they provided, were worthy of belief. The police investigation,
    from corroborating the CIs information to locating the storage locker, was
    unassailable. It followed a linear and logical path from one step to the next.
    While the focus of the investigation commenced at the Royalton Hotel, it
    inevitably shifted to the storage locker. The information in the ITO, as
    amplified by the cross-examination of Detective Constable Bartol, set out those
    investigatory steps taken, the objectives of the investigation and the need for
    a general warrant to surreptitiously enter the storage locker, obtain evidence
    and continue the investigation.</span></span></p>

    also explicitly addressed the best interests requirement in the ITO. He
    believed it would be in the best interests of the administration of justice to
    issue the proposed general warrant because the investigation was ongoing and
    the execution of a conventional warrant would likely terminate the
    investigation, as the main targets would be immediately notified that they were
    the subject of a police investigation. The reviewing judge referenced the need
    for surreptitious entry and concluded that “[n]othing in the ITO, nor in
    Detective Constable Bartol’s evidence in cross-examination, persuades me, as a
    reviewing justice, that seeking a general warrant in these circumstances, was
    inappropriate.”</span></span></p>

    He argues that the conditions of the warrant should have been explicit, clear,
    and narrowly drawn. Section 487.01(3) of the </span></span><em><span

    the bulk amount of hidden controlled substances and the full drug operation,
    and to add to the success of the investigation while preserving its integrity.
    Here the targets had rented the storage locker for months and in October alone,
    had accessed it at least 12 times. As this court noted in both </span><em>Ha</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> and </span><em>Lucas</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, an
    authorization under s.&nbsp;186(4)(e) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> to intercept private communications similarly may be valid
    for up to 60 days. The time was reasonable in the circumstances, and the 15
    conditions were clear and sufficiently narrow.</span></span></p>

    appellant submits that the purpose of the covert entry, namely the collection

    police might have gathered some evidence under a conventional search warrant,
    production order, or authorization to intercept communications, this does not
    preclude reliance on a general warrant: see e.g. </span></span><em><span

    paras. 50-51; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Ha</span></em><span

    J. confirmed that his approach to s. 487<a name="_Hlk77618671">.01(1)(c)</a> has
    nothing to do with investigative necessity: at para. 100. In addition, at para.
    102, he clarified that:</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[U]nder the “no
    other provision” test, the police are not asked to show why an alternative
    authorization </span></span><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA

class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA> on the facts of a particular case, but
    rather why it is </span></span><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA
style='text-decoration:none'>substantively different</span></span><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA> from what Parliament has already provided.
    Though the fact that an alternative authorization will satisfy the
    investigative objective of the police may be helpful as a factor in
    demonstrating its substantive equivalence, the inquiry under the “no other
    provision” test remains focused on the latter point, not the former. If the
    police successfully make this showing, the inquiry under s. 487.01(1)(c) ends. [Emphasis

  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>The focus in the s.
    487.01(1)(c) analysis is not on whether there are other investigative
    techniques that might accomplish the purported investigative purposes or goals
    of the police; rather, the focus is on the particular investigative technique
    or procedure that the police seek to utilize and whether it can properly be
    authorized by another provision in the </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Code</span></em><span

    at the storage locker. The other investigative techniques raised by the
    appellant are not, in substance, equivalent to unlimited covert entries and
    searches on private property. They would not allow the police to do what they
    sought to do in this case, namely, search the storage locker, where they
    believed evidence of the offences was located, without effectively terminating
    the ongoing investigation. The police in this case were not using the general
    warrant to circumvent more onerous requirements for other substantively
    equivalent investigative techniques.</span></span></p>
