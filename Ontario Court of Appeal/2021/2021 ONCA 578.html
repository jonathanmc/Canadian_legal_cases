  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Principals </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>L.S. was born female. Early in high school, L.S.
    began to identify as male. At all material times, L.S. was 15 years old. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was a married father of two
    children. Self-employed, he was 50 years old when the offences alleged were
    committed. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Grindr App </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Grindr is a dating app used by gay men. Its account
    holders must be 18 or older, but the service does not verify any information
    its account holders provide. Despite the age requirement, an account holder
    need not disclose their age. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>L.S. left his age blank on his Grindr profile.
    He included a photograph of his eye. An account holder could indicate the type
    of gay subculture with which he identified. L.S. did so. He indicated “twink”,
    a younger man with a boyish look. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant used the name “Tom” on his Grindr
    profile. He listed his age as 48. This was a lie. He was actually 50 years old
    and did not go by the name of “Tom” in his daily activities. The appellant knew
    that information provided in Grindr profiles was not verified. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Grindr Chats </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>L.S. and the appellant chatted on Grindr for about
    two or three weeks before they actually met. L.S. said he was 18. He had been
    born female but was transitioning to male. L.S. claimed he was doing a “lap”
    year at high school. He lived at home with his parents and a sibling. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During their chats on Grindr, L.S. did not tell
    the appellant that he (L.S.) was seeing an older man, “Steven”. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The First In-Person Meeting </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Early in the month following their virtual
    meetings, the appellant and L.S. met in person. The appellant picked up L.S. at
    school. They drove in the appellant’s truck to a nearby hotel. There they
    engaged in various forms of sexual activity before the appellant drove L.S.
    back to the parking lot of his high school. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant proposed another meeting the next
    day. L.S. demurred because he was seeing another man, “Steven”. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Later Meetings </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Over the next several weeks, the appellant and
    L.S. continued to chat and to meet. In most of their meetings, they had sex. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Later in the month of their first in-person
    meeting, L.S. told the appellant that he (L.S.) had chlamydia. He advised the
    appellant that he should be examined by a doctor. The appellant did so. The
    examination confirmed that the appellant also had chlamydia. Both received medical
    treatment. Their sexual activity ceased during the period of treatment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant believed that “Steven” was the
    source of the chlamydia that he (the appellant) had contracted from L.S. The
    appellant told L.S. that their relationship was over if L.S. continued to see
    other men. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The day following this ultimatum, L.S. told the
    appellant that he would end his relationship with “Steven”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The relationship between L.S. and the appellant
    continued over a few more weeks. They chatted and met. Medical treatment, and
    vacations interrupted their sexual activity. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Confession about Age </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 7, 2015, as the appellant and L.S.
    returned from sexual activity, the appellant asked L.S. what he proposed to do
    after completion of his “lap” year. L.S. paused as he had when “Steven” had
    asked him the same question. L.S. then told the appellant that he was only 15 –
    not 18, as he had said in their early meeting. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>L.S. and the appellant diverged in their
    accounts of what happened after L.S. disclosed his true age – 15 – to the
    appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>L.S. testified that the relationship continued
    after his age disclosure. This included sexual activity. He was challenged on
    this issue in cross-examination. Among other suggestions put to him was that he
    had confused what had happened after he had made a similar disclosure to
    “Steven” with what had occurred with the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant gave evidence that once L.S.
    disclosed his true age, they agreed that they could no longer see each other.
    Their only further contact, about which they were also agreed, was that the
    appellant could wish L.S. happy birthday when L.S. turned 16. The appellant
    extended his best wishes. L.S. did not reply. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Appellant’s State of Mind </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified that until L.S. told him
    that he was only 15, he (the appellant) believed that L.S. was 18. L.S. had
    told him so as their virtual relationship began and, according to the
    appellant, had said nothing to the contrary until their relationship ended. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant recounted several factors that
    confirmed his belief that L.S. was 18 during their sexual relationship. L.S.
    said he was 18 and used the Grindr app which required account holders to be 18.
    L.S. said that he was doing a “lap” year at high school, meaning Grade 13. L.S.
    demonstrated maturity in their conversations and assuredness in his sexual
    preferences. L.S.’s demeanour and physical appearance, which were consistent
    with his photograph, confirmed his stated age. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Appellant’s Inquiries </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was cross-examined about what
    steps he had taken to confirm his belief that L.S. was 18. He acknowledged that
    he only asked L.S. his age once, when they first met over Grindr. He did not
    inquire about why L.S. was doing a “lap” year at high school. Nor did the
    appellant tell anyone about their relationship. After they met in person, the
    appellant did not ask L.S. for any identification or whether he had a driver’s
    licence. The appellant did not inquire about the age of L.S.’s brother or ask
    to meet L.S.’s parents. They never met at L.S.’s home. The appellant picked up
    L.S. and dropped him off after their meetings some distance away from his home.
    The appellant acknowledged that people lie about their age and other things on
    Grindr. Indeed, he had lied about his own age in creating his profile on the
    Grindr app. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Positions at Trial</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial Crown advanced two alternative bases
    upon which the appellant’s guilt could be proven. First, he submitted that the
    appellant could be found guilty on the basis that the appellant continued his
    sexual relationship with L.S. after L.S. had disclosed his true age as 15. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, even if the appellant honestly believed
    that L.S. was at least 16, the Crown contended that it was proven beyond a reasonable
    doubt under s. 150.1(4) of the <i>Criminal Code, </i><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46,</span></em> that the appellant
    had not taken all reasonable steps to ascertain L.S.’s age. The Crown advanced
    this as an alternative path to conviction and as the principal basis of liability. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the appellant, defence counsel submitted
    that the trial judge should have a reasonable doubt that any sexual activity
    took place between the parties after L.S. told the appellant that he was 15. In
    the alternative, trial counsel argued that, throughout, the appellant honestly
    believed that L.S. was 18. Further, Crown counsel had failed to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt, as he was required to do, that the appellant did not take all
    reasonable steps to ascertain L.S.’s age. It followed, defence counsel urged,
    that the appellant should be acquitted. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Reasons of the Trial Judge </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Considering the first basis of liability
    advanced by the Crown, the trial judge was not satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the sexual relationship of the appellant and L.S. continued after
    L.S. told the appellant that he was 15. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Turning to the alternative basis of liability,
    the trial judge was satisfied that the appellant had an honest but mistaken
    belief throughout the sexual relationship that L.S. was 18, or at least 16.
    However, the trial judge was persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    appellant did not take all reasonable steps to ascertain L.S.’s age. He
    expressed his conclusion in these terms: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><a name="_Hlk80022574"><span lang=EN-CA>In the final analysis,
    W.G. simply took L.S.’s word that he was 18 years old, and he made assumptions
    that were not warranted in the particular circumstances. While concrete steps
    are not required in every case, they were clearly required in this case. </span></a><span
lang=EN-CA>The simplest step would have been to ask for identification. That
    was not done. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In the final analysis, I am satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt that W.G. did not take all reasonable steps to ascertain the
    age of L.S. before he engaged in sexual activity with him. Thus, as specified
    in s. 150.1(4) of the <em>Code</em>, it is not a defence to the charges under
    s. 151 or s. 271 that W.G. believed that L.S. was 16 years of age or more. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Grounds of Appeal </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant identifies three errors in the
    trial judge’s analysis which he says warrant entry of an acquittal, or at
    worst, an order for a new trial. He says that the trial judge erred: </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>in finding the fault element in sexual
    interference satisfied on the basis of the appellant’s failure to take all
    reasonable steps to ascertain the true age of L.S.; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>in his interpretation of the “all reasonable
    steps” requirement in s. 150.1(4); and </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>in misapprehending the evidence about L.S.’s online dating profile
    on Grindr. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first two grounds of appeal are related and
    can be combined for the purpose of analysis. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #1: The Fault Element in Sexual Interference </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The argument advanced in support of this ground
    of appeal does not require further reference to the evidence adduced at trial
    or the reasons of the trial judge. A canvass of the arguments advanced in this
    court is sufficient prelude to the discussion that follows. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Arguments on Appeal </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant begins with the unassailable:
    subjective fault is a bedrock principle of the criminal law in Canada. Yet
    here, the appellant says, the trial judge failed to give effect to that
    principle. This is because the judge, having found that the appellant honestly
    believed L.S. was over 16, nonetheless convicted the appellant because he
    failed to take all reasonable steps to ascertain L.S.’s age. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The failure to take all reasonable steps
    requirement in s. 150.1(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, the appellant says,
    simply bars an accused from raising a positive defence – mistaken belief in age
    – in answer to a charge of sexual interference. The failure does not provide, and
    thus cannot be invoked, as an independent pathway to conviction as occurred
    here. Previous authority notwithstanding, no longer can the Crown establish an
    accused’s guilt of sexual interference on either of two bases – actual
    knowledge of the complainant’s underage status, or the failure to take all reasonable
    steps to ascertain the complainant’s true age. Only actual knowledge of the
    complainant’s underage status will suffice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, the appellant continues, the trial judge
    required him to show not only that he honestly but mistakenly believed that
    L.S. was at least 16 years old, but also that he had taken all reasonable steps
    to ascertain L.S.’s age. But the onus is on the Crown to disprove the defence
    for which s. 150.1(4) provides, by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    appellant either did not honestly believe L.S. was of age, or that he failed to
    take all reasonable steps to ascertain L.S.’s true age. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s findings, according to the
    appellant, require entry of an acquittal or, at the very least, a new trial. To
    establish the fault element of sexual interference, the Crown had to prove
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant believed, was wilfully blind, or
    was reckless as to whether L.S. was under 16. The trial judge found that the
    appellant honestly believed that L.S. was 18, thus not under 16 years of age.
    On this finding, the appellant was entitled to an acquittal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Even if the appellant is not entitled to an
    acquittal under the new sexual assault fault regime, a new trial is required. The
    trial judge, the appellant contends, failed to consider and decide whether the
    Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the state of
    mind necessary to establish guilt. The trial judge found that there was an air
    of reality to the appellant’s assertion that he had taken all reasonable steps
    to ascertain L.S.’s true age. Even if the trial judge was satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the appellant had not taken all reasonable steps as
    required by s. 150.1(4), it remained incumbent on the Crown to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the appellant believed, was wilfully blind to, or was
    reckless as to whether L.S. was under 16. But the trial judge never adverted
    to, much less decided whether the Crown had proven the required fault element
    beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the need for a new trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to the above, the appellant also challenges
    the trial judge’s interpretation and approach to the “all reasonable steps”
    element in s. 150.1(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The trial judge, the
    appellant complains, failed to conduct the assessment contextually, in
    particular, by failing to take into account the appellant’s subjective belief
    that L.S. was over 16. What constitutes “all reasonable steps” depends on the
    context of each case and requires an assessment of all the circumstances. The
    term “steps” has two modifiers: “all” and “reasonable”. The trial judge read
    “all” as “every”, thus approaching the requirement as a checklist, contrary to
    what the authorities teach. Steps that are not reasonably necessary in the
    circumstances need not be taken. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The subjective belief of an accused informs but
    is not determinative of the contextual “all reasonable steps” inquiry under s.
    150.1(4). Here, the trial judge’s failure to consider the appellant’s belief in
    L.S.’s age resulted in a disproportionate focus on the positive steps taken,
    rather than whether the context required <em>any</em> further inquiries. An
    honest belief not based on ignorance, but as here, grounded on L.S.’s own
    representation may obviate the need for further inquiry. Indeed, the appellant
    engaged the very inquiry necessitated by the circumstances. His conduct belies
    the states of mind required to establish the fault element in sexual
    interference. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent disagrees. The Crown rejects any
    suggestion of legal error in the trial judge’s analysis and conclusion. Admittedly,
    the analysis did not conform to what is now required because the trial judge
    did not have the teachings of those cases to guide him. But once the trial
    judge found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    appellant had not taken all reasonable steps required by the circumstances to
    ascertain L.S.’s true age, the appellant was not entitled to rely on the
    mistaken belief in age defence. The appellant’s conviction, in turn, was
    inevitable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In several pages of her factum, the respondent
    articulated her concern with the reasoning of the majority of the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <em>R. v. Morrison</em>, 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3. The
    purpose of this critical analysis, she indicated, is to preserve a right of
    appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on this basis. These submissions are best
    left to another place, at another time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When s. 150.1(4) is properly interpreted, the
    respondent contends, the subsection does not overlay a discrete mistaken belief
    in age defence on top of a fault element with respect to age for offences
    involving sexual activity with children. Instead, the <em>mens rea</em> component requires the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of
    a reasonable mistaken belief with respect to the complainant’s age. However,
    even accepting that disproof of a mistaken belief of age is an inquiry distinct
    from that involving proof of the elements of an offence, negating mistaken
    belief in age to the extent of reasonable doubt is tantamount to proof of the
    culpable mental state required for offences such as sexual interference. A
    conviction of that offence is inevitable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The “all reasonable steps” requirement in s.
    150.1(4) obliges an accused who advances a mistaken belief in age defence to
    have exercised the same degree of care in ascertaining a complainant’s age that
    a reasonable person would exercise in equivalent circumstances. This inquiry is
    a highly contextual, fact-specific exercise. It includes both objective and
    subjective components. When the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that an
    accused did not take all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainant’s age,
    the defence of mistaken belief in consent is no longer available for the trier
    of fact to consider. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although rejection of the mistaken belief
    defence in s. 150.1(4) and the nature of the fault element required in respect
    of the age-specific sexual offences remain closely associated, the fault
    element must be defined in terms of the accused’s state of mind. The fault
    element in s. 151 includes actual knowledge or belief and wilful blindness. But
    it also extends to recklessness, that is to say, an awareness of some level of
    risk and a determination to proceed despite that risk. An accused who decides
    to proceed with sexual activity with an underage complainant after adverting to
    the possibility that the complainant was underage, is reckless with respect to
    the complainant’s age, even if the risk that the complainant is underage is
    low. Where an accused cannot rely on his evidence about mistaken belief in age
    because he has not taken reasonable steps to ascertain the complainant’s age,
    no reasonable doubt can arise with respect to proof of the fault element of the
    offence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the respondent argues, the
    appellant did advert to the question of L.S.’s age. If the trial judge
    correctly concluded that the appellant failed to take all reasonable steps in
    the circumstances as he knew them, then he cannot rely on the defence of
    mistaken belief and his claim in that respect is of no legal effect. The trial
    judge made no error in his “all reasonable steps” analysis. The appellant was
    properly convicted. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Governing Principles </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The principles that control our decision are of

    his decision. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The principles at work have to do with the
    essential elements of the offence of sexual interference; the mistaken belief
    in age defence in s. 150.1(4); and the combined effect of these principles in
    the circumstances of this case. Those circumstances include two findings of
    fact made by the trial judge: </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the appellant honestly believed L.S. was
    18; and </span></p>

    steps to ascertain L.S.’s age as required by s. 150.1(4) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Offence Charged: Sexual Interference </span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was charged with sexual
    interference, an age-specific offence created by s. 151 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> prohibiting defined sexual conduct with a prescribed class or group
    of persons. To establish this offence in the circumstances of this case, the
    Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt: </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>L.S. was under 16; </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>the touching was for a sexual purpose. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Like the cognate offence of invitation to sexual
    touching in s. 152, the language of the section creating the offence of sexual
    interference says nothing expressly about the <em>mens rea</em> requirement or
    fault element as it relates to an accused’s belief about the age of the
    complainant: see <em>R. v. Carbone</em>, 2020 ONCA 394, 150 O.R. (3d) 758, at
    para. 67. See also <em>R. v. B.J.T</em>., 2019 ONCA 694, 378 C.C.C. (3d) 238,
    at para. 37. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The language in s. 151 does <em>not</em> track
    the formula expressed in s. 172.1(1) requiring that the complainant be “a
    person who is, or who the accused believes is, …” under a specified age: see <i>Carbone</i>,
    at paras. 98-99. Thus, the fault element in s. 151 would appear to be the
    intention to touch the body of a person under 16 with a part of the accused’s
    own body for a sexual purpose. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>Mistaken Belief in Age: Section 150.1(4)</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 150.1(4) applies to the sexual
    interference offence of s. 151. Section 150.1(4) refers to a defence and
    imposes restrictions upon its availability. The defence, absent the statutory
    restrictions, has its roots in the common law which permit a defence of mistake
    about an essential element of an offence requiring proof of <em>mens rea</em>. The
    section precludes the defence of an honest but mistaken belief that the complainant
    was at least 16 years old unless the accused took “all reasonable steps” to
    ascertain the complainant’s age. A similar statutory provision appears in s.
    172.1(4) which, like s. 150.1(4), forecloses the defence where the claim is
    entirely devoid of an objective basis: <em>Morrison </em>at para. 45; <em>Carbone</em>,
    at para. 67. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Substantive defences like s. 150.1(4) have
    implications for the burden of proof. An evidentiary burden is imposed on the
    accused. A persuasive burden on the Crown. The threshold evidentiary burden on
    the accused is to adduce evidence sufficient to give the defence an air of
    reality: <em>Morrison</em>, at paras. 84, 118; <em>R. v. Levigne</em>, 2010 SCC
    25, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 32(3); and <em>Carbone</em>, at para. 129. This
    requires the introduction of evidence that would permit the trier of fact to
    find that the accused believed the complainant was the required age and took
    all reasonable steps to determine the complainant’s age: <em>Morrison</em>, at
    paras. 119-120; <em>Carbone</em>, at para. 129. This is consistent with general
    principles: <em>R. v. Cinous</em>, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 2,

    burden under s. 150.1(4), the defence available under that section fails <em>in
    limine</em> in accordance with general principle. However, where the
    evidentiary burden is met, the defence is in play and becomes available for the
    trier of fact to consider in accordance with its terms. Once the defence is in
    play, the burden settles upon the Crown to negate the defence for which the

    Crown may negate it in either of two ways. The Crown may prove that the accused
    did not honestly believe that the complainant was at least 16 years old at the
    time of the alleged offence. Or the Crown may prove that, despite the accused’s
    claim that they honestly believed that the complainant was at least 16, the
    accused did not take all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainant’s age: <em>Morrison</em>,

    legal age are not reasonable steps. Relevant considerations include not only
    the nature of the steps themselves, but also the information that those steps

    play, but disproved by the Crown, the consequences for proof of the essential
    elements of the offence vary. To illustrate what I mean, consider the offence
    of second degree murder and the defences of self-defence, alibi, and
    provocation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the Crown disproves a defence of
    self-defence that is advanced as the sole defence to a charge of second degree
    murder, the Crown has established an essential element of the offence – an
    unlawful killing – but not the offence itself. This is because rebuttal of the
    defence says nothing about proof of the fault element in second degree murder. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Where an accused advances a defence of alibi and
    the Crown disproves it beyond a reasonable doubt, the effect is of no

    only that they were not elsewhere as they claimed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    proven. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    reasonable doubt that the accused did not take all reasonable steps to
    ascertain the complainant’s age, this means that the defence is unavailing. But
    it does not mean that, on this basis alone, the offence charged has been proven
    beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether the offence charged has been so proven
    depends on whether the trier of fact concludes that the Crown has proven beyond
    a reasonable doubt that the accused believed that the complainant was underage: <em>Morrison</em>, at para. 129. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Where the Crown has disproven the honest belief
    in age defence in s. 150.1(4), the trier of fact is left with three possible
    states of mind. The accused may have believed or have been wilfully blind to
    the fact that the complainant was under 16. The accused may have appreciated
    that there was a risk that the complainant was under 16 but decided to go ahead
    anyway despite that risk. Or the accused may never have adverted to the
    complainant’s age and chose to proceed with the touching: <em>Carbone</em>, at
    para. 122. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fault element under s. 151 may be proven by
    establishing that the accused believed that the complainant was under 16, or
    that the accused was wilfully blind to the fact that the complainant was under
    16. The Crown may also establish the fault element by proving beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the accused believed that there was a risk that the complainant
    was under 16, but went ahead anyway, choosing to do so despite the risk. In
    other words, the accused was reckless as to the complainant’s true age. And the
    Crown may also demonstrate that the accused never turned their mind to the
    complainant’s age as they proceeded. This too may establish recklessness on the
    accused’s part with respect to the complainant’s age. Reckless indifference is
    a subjective state of mind bespeaking a choice on the part of an accused to
    treat the complainant’s age as irrelevant and to assume the risk associated
    with their choice: <em>Carbone</em>, at paras. 123, 126-127. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As <em>Carbone</em> teaches, the fault element
    of recklessness is subjective. It involves the appreciation of some level of
    risk coupled with the conscious decision to take that risk. Under s. 151, an
    accused who chooses to proceed with the activity the section prohibits – sexual
    activity with young persons – after having adverted to the possibility that the
    complainant was underage, will inevitably be found to have been reckless with
    respect to the complainant’s age: <em>Carbone</em>, at para. 125. So too, at
    least in most cases, indifference to the complainant’s age, a state of mind
    that reflects a positive choice by an accused to treat the complainant’s age as
    irrelevant to their decision to engage in the sexual activity: <em>Carbone</em>,

  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Principles Applied </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal. To explain why, I begin with some background. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, several circumstances were
    uncontroversial. The sexual activity which the appellant and L.S. participated
    took place within the time period alleged in the indictment and amounted to the
    external circumstances or <em>actus reus</em> of the offences charged. The
    appellant touched the body of L.S. with a part of his own body. The touching
    was for a sexual purpose. L.S. was 15. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence the appellant advanced at trial was
    that he honestly believed that L.S. was 18, thus not under 16 as the
    offence-creating provision requires, and that he had taken all reasonable steps
    in the circumstances as he knew them to ascertain L.S.’s age. In other words,
    the appellant had satisfied all the requirements of s. 150.1(4) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge
    made two findings of fact upon which he rested his decision that the Crown had
    proven the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. He found that the
    appellant honestly believed that L.S. was 18 and would have made the same
    finding even if the appellant had to establish this fact beyond a reasonable
    doubt. The trial judge also found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the appellant failed to take all reasonable steps the circumstances
    required to ascertain L.S.’s true age. On the basis of the then existing
    authorities, these two findings together established the appellant’s guilt of
    both offences charged. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We now know that this reasoning, which treats
    the failure to take all reasonable steps to ascertain a complainant’s age as a
    discrete pathway to conviction, is erroneous. This is because this reasoning
    fails to take into account the fault element the Crown is required to prove in
    cases of sexual interference where the mistaken belief in age defence of s.
    150.1(4) has failed for want of all reasonable steps. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To establish the requisite fault element in the
    circumstances of this case, the Crown had a suite of options. Actual belief
    that L.S. was under 16. Wilful blindness as to whether L.S. was under 16. And
    recklessness, either through the appellant’s appreciation of the risk that L.S.
    was under 16 and proceeding anyway in spite of that risk, or in never turning
    his mind to L.S.’s age. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court has indicated that this additional
    step – assessing the adequacy of the proof of the fault element – will have
    little practical effect on verdicts rendered on the basis of the former
    alternative pathway analysis. This is so because removal of the positive belief
    that the complainant was the required age, in tandem with recklessness as a
    basis for a finding of <em>mens rea</em>, will leave little room for a
    conclusion other than that an accused was, at minimum, reckless as to the
    complainant’s true age: <em>Carbone</em>, at para. 130. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Whether the result would have been the same
    under the additional step now required in the <em>mens rea</em> analysis under
    the alternative pathway approach, which this court has said is likely to be the
    case in the majority of instances, will turn largely on the trial judge’s
    analysis of the failure of the accused to take all reasonable steps to
    determine the age of the complainant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the trial judge likened the
    analysis required as akin to an inquiry into the exercise of due diligence.
    There was no checklist of factors dipositive of the issue. The benchmark was
    what steps a reasonable person in equivalent circumstances would have
    undertaken to determine the complainant’s age. The analysis was highly
    contextual and fact specific. The trial judge then listed the factors upon
    which the appellant relied and rejected the submission that they met the
    standard required by s. 150.1(4). He concluded that the appellant essentially
    accepted L.S.’s statement about his age without further meaningful inquiry. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, contrary to the position advanced by the
    appellant, the trial judge specifically rejected a checklist approach to the
    issue framed by s. 150.1(4). He did not require a standard of perfection. The
    offences charged were complete within minutes of the first actual meeting
    between the parties. The appellant relied on what L.S. had said on his Grindr
    profile and in their chats. He well knew that things were not as advertised on
    Grindr. Account holders lied about many things. Their identity. Their age, as
    he did himself. The age gap between the parties was three decades. This is not
    a case where L.S.’s physical appearance showed him to be clearly of age. The
    appellant had no external benchmarks against which to test L.S.’s
    representation about his age. He made no request for identification, simply took
    L.S. at his word and made unwarranted assumptions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the circumstances of this case, I am
    satisfied that, had he had the benefit of the later authorities, the trial
    judge would have reached the same conclusion. The trial judge rejected the
    single defence advanced, that is to say, that the appellant honestly believed
    L.S. was over 16 when the sexual activity prohibited by s. 151 took place. The
    rejection was grounded on the appellant’s failure to take all reasonable steps
    to ascertain L.S.’s true age. This rejection took the appellant’s claim that he
    believed L.S. was at least 16 out of the evidentiary mix. This rejection, on
    these facts, left only two possibilities. <a name="_Hlk79746544">Either the
    appellant actually knew or was wilfully blind as to whether L.S. was under 16,
    or that he was reckless about L.S.’s true age</a>. Either is sufficient to
    establish the <em>mens rea</em> required by s. 151. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #2: Misapprehension of Evidence</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant urges a second ground of appeal.
    He says that the trial judge misapprehended evidence that was material to the
    finding of guilt. This misapprehension provided context to the reasonableness
    of the appellant’s inquiries and his perception of L.S.’s appearance. It was thus
    important to the “all reasonable steps” analysis under s. 150.1(4) that led the
    trial judge to reject the only defence put forward at trial. </span></p>

    he identified as a “twink”, a younger gay man who had a boyish look. Briefly, a
    boyish gay man. This attracted plenty of attention on Grindr from older men. </span></p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Reasons of the Trial Judge </span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his written reasons, the trial judge referred
    to evidence that on his Grindr profile, the appellant indicated his interest in
    two “tribes”: “The </span>‘<span lang=EN-CA>twink’ tribe (being younger-looking
    men) and another tribe, being older men.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge made no reference to any evidence
    about the appellant being accepted by others as older than his true age or his

  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Arguments on Appeal </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In brief submissions on this issue, the
    appellant contended that the trial judge was in error about the substance of
    the evidence about the online Grindr profile of L.S. His designation of the
    tribe “twink” did <em>not</em> indicate his interest in younger men, as the
    trial judge recounted it, but that he was someone who had a youthful
    appearance. This misapprehension was material because it provided further
    context to the reasonableness of the appellant’s inquiries and his perception of
    L.S.’s appearance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk79755054"><span lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, the appellant says that the trial
    judge failed to consider evidence that others accepted that the complainant was
    18 and that he had used fake identification in the past. This evidence
    indicated that the appellant’s failure to cross-examine L.S. about his age or
    to ask for identification were unlikely to produce any truthful response about
    his actual age. It follows that the appellant’s failure to do so should not
    have tolled against him in the “all reasonable steps” analysis</span></a><span
lang=EN-CA>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent demurs. There was no
    misapprehension of evidence, in either sense advanced by the appellant,
    material to the reasoning process that led to the findings of guilt. This is a
    stringent test. The misapprehension must be an essential, rather than
    peripheral, part of the reasoning process leading to the finding of guilt. For
    it to amount to a miscarriage of justice, the misapprehension must leave the
    balance of the reasoning on shaky ground when struck from the determination of
    guilt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the respondent submits, the trial judge
    was not mistaken about the substance of the evidence about the “twink” tribe
    selected on L.S.’s Grindr profile. L.S. explained its meaning. The tribe “twink”
    referred to younger gay men. This comported with his youthful appearance and reinforced
    his later representations that he was 18. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk79751431"><span lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the trial judge’s failure to refer to
    evidence that others accepted that L.S. was 18, including others on Grindr such
    as “Steven”, was of no consequence to the trial judge’s findings of guilt. Neither
    was it of consequence that the trial judge failed to refer to evidence that
    L.S. had apparently used or tried to use fake identification, and thus might
    have done so if asked by the appellant for identification. None of these steps
    were taken by the appellant. </span></a></p>

lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The principles governing appellate review of
    claims of misapprehension of evidence are well established in our
    jurisprudence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A misapprehension of evidence includes a mistake
    about the substance of evidence, a failure to consider evidence relevant to
    decide a material issue, or a failure to give proper effect to evidence: <em>R.
    v. Morrissey</em> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.), at pp. 217-218. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For a misapprehension of evidence to vitiate a
    conviction on the ground of a miscarriage of justice, the misapprehension must
    have to do with the substance of the evidence, not merely its details. The
    misapprehension must be material, not merely peripheral, and the error must
    play an essential part in the reasoning process leading to conviction, not just
    in the narrative of the judgment: <em>R. v. Lohrer</em>, 2004 SCC 80, [2004] 3
    S.C.R. 732, at para. 2. An error in the assessment of evidence amounts to a
    miscarriage of justice only if striking it from the judgment leaves the reasoning
    leading to the finding of guilt on shaky ground: <em>R. v. Sinclair</em>, 2011
    SCC 40, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 56. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Principles Applied </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my respectful view, this ground of appeal
    fails. As I will explain, the claims of misapprehension advanced here, whether
    considered individually or in combination, simply do not ascend to the
    stringent threshold required to warrant our intervention. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the evidence about L.S.’s Grindr profile. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The reasons of the trial judge include two references to the
    “tribes” included in L.S.’s Grindr profile. Each refers to “twink” and another
    tribe with interest in older men. The profile itself was not tendered or filed
    as an exhibit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The initial reference to “another tribe, being older men” appears
    under the heading “Background”. This is a narrative part of the judgment. It
    informs no part of the reasoning process leading to conviction. The second
    reference is contained in a summary of the appellant’s testimony at trial,
    recounting the factors upon which the appellant relied on to found his belief
    that L.S. was 18. The reference is faithful to the appellant’s testimony that
    the designation of a “tribe” reflected the account holder’s sexual preferences,
    “things that you’re interested in.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>To the extent that the submission about misapprehension of evidence
    is grounded on a mistake about the substance of this evidence, the argument
    fails. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Nor am I persuaded that the omission of references to the acceptance
    by others of L.S.’s representations that he was 18, or that he had used fake
    identification in the past, contaminated the judge’s conclusion that the
    appellant failed to take all reasonable steps to ascertain L.S.’s true age. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The evidence was of doubtful admissibility – at least to the extent
    that it consisted of a witness reporting what others had said about acceptance
    of L.S.’s age-related representations as evidence of actual acceptance, or L.S.’s
    possession or use of false identification. It would appear to offend the
    hearsay rule and fall well short of admission by exception. Even received as
    non-hearsay, there was no evidence that it formed part of the appellant’s
    consideration. Similar admissibility concerns emerged when L.S. was asked in
    cross-examination whether others accepted that he was 18. That they did so was
    scarcely something about which he could testify, all the more so when the
    circumstances of such acceptance were not disclosed. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. </span></p>
