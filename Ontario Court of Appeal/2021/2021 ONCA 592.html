  <p class=Judge><strong>Jamal J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2008, Ontario and OLG entered into a “Gaming Revenue Sharing and
    Financial Agreement” with First Nations Partnership, a limited partnership of
    Ontario First Nations. Under the Agreement, Ontario and OLG agreed to share with
    First Nations three types of revenue associated with gaming in Ontario.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few years later, however, OLG decided to outsource its non-gaming amenities
    to private operators, effectively giving them responsibility for two of the
    three types of revenue under the Agreement. Private sector operators assumed
    the risk and responsibility for non-gaming amenities, in exchange for keeping
    100% of the associated non-gaming revenue. OLG described this arrangement as
    “modernization”. Although OLG anticipated much greater revenue under modernization,
    it did not disclose its outsourcing plans to the First Nations Partnership or
    seek to amend the Agreement to be relieved of the obligation to pay the First
    Nations Partnership all three types of revenue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When OLG implemented modernization, it stopped paying the First Nations
    Partnership two of the three types of revenue under the Agreement. When the
    First Nations Partnership discovered this, it initiated an arbitration under
    the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arbitration panel held that Ontario and OLG breached the Agreement.
    The majority ruled that Ontario and OLG breached express contractual terms when
    they stopped paying two of three agreed-upon types of revenue. The dissenting
    member found that Ontario and OLG’s unilateral changes to the operation of the
    Agreement breached an implied contractual term, describing their conduct as “breathtaking
    in the age of reconciliation.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge dismissed Ontario and OLG’s appeals.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario and OLG now appeal to this court. They argue that the appeal
    judge made three errors: he applied the wrong standard of review,
    misinterpreted the Agreement, and erred in concluding that they breached the
    honour of the Crown.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeals. I would uphold
    the majority decision of the arbitration panel on any standard of review. I see
    no error in the appeal judge’s interpretation of the Agreement and I would find
    it unnecessary to address the honour of the Crown.</p>
  <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OLG is a Crown corporation that conducts and manages lottery schemes in
    Ontario on behalf of the provincial government. It operates under an exemption
    to the prohibition against gaming and betting in Canada under the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. OLG’s profits are paid to Ontario and are the province’s
    largest source of non-tax revenue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The First Nations Partnership is a limited partnership of 132 Ontario First
    Nations established to receive and distribute revenue under the Agreement to promote
    education, health, economic, cultural, and community development in First
    Nations communities.</p>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior gaming-revenue litigation</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Agreement
    was reached after about a decade of disputes between Ontario and First Nations
    involving gaming revenues. Foremost among these was litigation over an earlier revenue
    sharing agreement, the Casino Rama Revenue Agreement, which entitled the First
    Nations Partnership’s predecessor to a share of revenue from Casino Rama<a
name="_Hlk50123657"> — a casino complex located on the reserve lands of The
    Chippewas of Rama First Nation. First Nations sued Ontario and OLG for more
    than $2 billion in damages after a new Ontario government imposed a 20% “win
    tax” on Casino Rama’s gross revenues to be paid to Ontario in priority to First
    Nations’ entitlement. Through the Agreement, the parties agreed to settle the “win
    tax” and other litigation.</a></p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Agreement on the definition of “Gross Revenue” to be shared</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2004,
    when the “win tax” litigation was underway, OLG proposed that the parties enter
    into a new revenue sharing agreement to address First Nations’ concerns about
    the unpredictable and reduced revenue flows under the prior arrangements. The first
    phase of negotiations was between former Ontario Premier David Peterson, as
    Ontario’s representative, and First Nations. The Order&#8209;in-Council
    appointing Mr. Peterson stated Ontario’s desire to “establish a new Ontario
    First Nations Gaming Revenue Sharing Agreement that provides more stable
    funding and strengthens the financial position of the Ontario First Nations”.
    Mr. Peterson’s terms of reference contained a similar instruction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the first phase of negotiations, a draft agreement was reached, but was not
    ratified by First Nations’ Chiefs in June 2007. The parties did, however, agree
    on a key item, “Gross Revenue”, that would eventually become part of the Agreement
    — the base of provincial gaming revenue to be shared with First Nations would
    include three sources: (1) gaming revenue from lotteries, slots, and table
    games from operations conducted and managed by OLG (“gaming revenue”); (2)
    revenues from non-gaming activities ancillary to those operations (“non-gaming
    revenue”); and (3) the retail value of accommodation, food and beverage
    services, and other services provided to gaming patrons on a complimentary
    basis to encourage them to visit and stay at the gaming sites (“Comps”). These
    three types of revenue comprised Gross Revenue. Even though Comps were an
    expense to OLG and not revenue, they were deemed to be revenue for revenue sharing
    purposes. OLG gave First Nations’ negotiators financial projections of the anticipated
    future revenue based on all three components of Gross Revenue, with a breakdown
    of each. The draft agreement provided that the First Nations Partnership would
    receive 1.6% of Gross Revenue, which included all three revenue sources.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the draft agreement was presented to First Nations’ Chiefs, the First Nations sought
    confirmation that in the future Ontario would not “turn current revenues that
    are received to the final account of the Province into revenues that are not”.
    In response, Mr. Peterson provided Ontario’s “unequivocal commitment to share …
    gross gaming revenue”. He assured First Nations that Ontario would not conduct
    itself in any way to undermine the agreement by allowing “revenues from such gaming
    [to] go to third parties”. He also noted that the First Nations Partnership
    would have “a full and equal member on the board of directors of OLG to protect
    and advance the interests of First Nations in Ontario”. The government
    separately assured the First Nations Partnership that “the primary objective of
    the proposed draft agreements is to replace an uncertain source of revenues
    with stable, predictable long term funds for First Nations communities”.
    Despite these assurances, the First Nations Chiefs did not approve the proposed
    agreement.</p>
  <h5>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reaching the Agreement</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A second
    phase of the negotiations began in late 2007 on a government-to-government
    basis between First Nations’ Chiefs and the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs,
    Michael Bryant, based on the same agreed-upon definition of Gross Revenue. The negotiations
    were solemn and based on First Nations’ traditions, including smudge ceremonies
    and the presence of sacred objects. The terms of the Agreement were ultimately reached
    in 2008. The Agreement now provided that the First Nations Partnership would
    receive 1.7% of Gross Revenue, again based on all three revenue sources.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the Agreement was approved by First Nations’ Chiefs, Minister Bryant assured
    the Chiefs that the agreement “provides stability of revenue for 25 years” grounded
    in “a new relationship based upon respect and autonomy”. After hearing Minister
    Bryant, the First Nations’ Chiefs approved the Agreement.</p>
  <h5>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Key terms of the Agreement</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    key terms of the Agreement are set out in the Appendix to these reasons.</p>
  <h5>(e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Events leadings to this litigation</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2010, less than two years after the Agreement was signed, OLG began a strategic
    business review of its operations to address declining provincial gaming
    revenues. Based on that review, OLG decided to outsource its non-gaming
    amenities to the private sector — a process it called “modernization”. Under modernization,
    private sector operators would assume the risk and responsibility for
    non-gaming amenities in exchange for keeping 100% of the associated non&#8209;gaming
    revenue. OLG believed this was necessary to attract world-class private
    operators to invest in OLG’s non-gaming amenities. OLG anticipated much greater
    revenue after modernization, projecting a $1.3 billion increase in net profits annually
    once implemented.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the Agreement was signed in 2008, neither OLG nor the First Nations Partnership
    believed that it was legally possible for OLG to outsource its non&#8209;gaming
    operations. OLG only changed its position in 2011, based on its strategic
    business review of the benefits of modernization. As the appeal judge noted, modernization
    “represented a wholesale reinterpretation by Ontario and OLG of OLG’s mandate
    relating to non-gaming amenities under its enabling legislation. It was
    completely different from what the parties mutually understood to be legally
    possible during the negotiation of the [Agreement].”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For several
    years, OLG did not disclose its planned outsourcing to either the First Nations
    Partnership or the provincial government, including the provincial Ministry of
    Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. By early 2013, OLG had decided that once
    it outsourced its non-gaming operations, it would stop sharing non-gaming
    revenue and Comps with the First Nations Partnership. Internal OLG emails in
    October 2015 show that OLG knew this would be a “hot button” issue for First
    Nations. OLG also knew that turning off two of the three revenue “taps” could
    lead to decreasing payments under the Agreement. One internal OLG email noted
    that payments to the First Nations Partnership “could decrease simply based on
    the fact that they will not be entitled to the 1.7% of non-gaming revenue as
    this will remain with the [private] service provider”. Even so, OLG did not
    disclose its plans to the First Nations Partnership or to First Nations. OLG
    disclosed its plans to Ontario’s Ministry of Finance for the first time during
    a conference call in or around December 2015. Even then, OLG still did not tell
    the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, which had government
    responsibility for First Nations peoples.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In January
    2016, OLG implemented modernization: it began the process of outsourcing its
    non-gaming operations to private operators and ceasing to share non-gaming
    revenue and Comps with the First Nations Partnership. The First Nations
    Partnership learned this in June 2016, through a note to the 2016 audited
    financial statements required under the Agreement. The Ministry of Indigenous
    Relations and Reconciliation learned this in the summer of 2016, when the First
    Nations Partnership began the arbitration process.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    reason the First Nations Partnership did not learn of OLG’s plans for so long was
    because Ontario and OLG failed to seat a representative of the First Nations
    Partnership on OLG’s board from 2008 until 2015, even though doing so was a
    contractual obligation under the Agreement. When the First Nations Partnership pursued
    arbitration under the Agreement to secure its promised board member, a panel
    composed of three retired judges of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice
    unanimously held that Ontario had breached the Agreement in bad faith and in a
    manner that was “egregious” and exhibited “an odour of moral failure”. The
    panel also noted that the First Nations Partnership had not been “consulted or
    invited to take part” in OLG’s strategic business review at a time when it had
    no board member.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitration that is the subject of the present appeals was formally commenced against
    Ontario and OLG in late February 2017. The First Nations Partnership claimed Ontario
    and OLG breached the Agreement when they stopped sharing non-gaming revenue and
    Comps, two of the three types of revenue they had agreed to share under the Agreement.</p>

    before a three-member panel chaired by Hon. Mr. Stephen T. Goudge, Q.C., and
    including Mr. Stan G. Fisher, Q.C. and Mr. John Campion. The panel received
    affidavit evidence and expert reports and heard seven days of <em>viva voce</em> evidence from ten witnesses, including several who were directly involved in
    the process leading to the Agreement, such as Mr. Bryant. The panel released a
    comprehensive, 385-paragraph arbitration award.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    panel majority, Mr. Goudge and Mr. Fisher, ruled that the Agreement required the
    appellants to share 1.7% of the three revenue sources existing when the Agreement
    was signed in 2008, namely, gaming revenue, non-gaming revenue, and Comps. The majority
    ruled the appellants breached the Agreement when they stopped paying non-gaming
    revenue and Comps as a result of modernization, because modernization did not relieve
    them of their payment obligation under the Agreement. The majority ordered OLG
    to provide an accounting and to pay the respondent 1.7% of the non-gaming
    revenue and Comps from January 2016, when the first outsourced site began
    operating, to the end of the term of the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    majority took the view that the honour of the Crown doctrine was engaged by the
    Agreement and was relevant to its interpretation. Although the majority ultimately
    interpreted the Agreement without relying on the honour of the Crown, they
    noted the doctrine provided “clear moral support” for their interpretation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    dissenting member, Mr. Campion, found that the arbitration turned on
    “reasonable differences in the interpretation of the Agreement”. In his view, Ontario
    and OLG had not breached any obligation under the Agreement to pay the First
    Nations Partnership 1.7% of the three revenue sources after modernization,
    because the First Nations Partnership had no right to share in revenues that
    OLG did not receive. In his opinion, the majority’s interpretation of the Agreement
    relied on inadmissible evidence of the parties’ negotiations leading to the Agreement.
    Finally, he noted that even if Ontario and OLG had breached the Agreement by
    not paying 1.7% of all three revenue sources, the First Nations Partnership had
    not suffered any damages.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the dissenting member concluded that Ontario and OLG breached an implied term of
    the Agreement to disclose and consult with the First Nation Partnership before
    it made any fundamental changes to the revenue structures under the Agreement. He
    found OLG “fail[ed] to meet these minimum standards of notice and
    consultation”. In his view, Ontario and OLG “failed in their government-to-government
    commitment with [the First Nations Partnership] in not giving them notice and
    consulting with them” before they “changed” the Agreement by outsourcing two of
    the three revenue sources. He stated that “[t]he contrast between the words of
    hope, promise, respect, trust and self-government and the unilateral action of
    OLG and Ontario in changing the [Agreement] without notice and consultation is
    breathtaking in the age of reconciliation”. Even so, he concluded the First
    Nations Partnership suffered no damages for breach of the implied term. In his
    view, the honour of the Crown doctrine did not apply to the Agreement.</p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal decision</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge dismissed Ontario and OLG’s appeals. He noted he had no
    jurisdiction to review the panel’s many findings of fact because s. 9.2 of the Agreement
    limited any appeal of an arbitration award to “questions of law, or questions
    of mixed fact and law”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge ruled that the reasonableness standard of review applied to the
    majority’s contractual interpretation of the Agreement and the damages award.
    He based his conclusion on the Supreme Court of Canada’s decisions in <em>Sattva
    Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp.</em>, 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, and <em>Teal Cedar Products Ltd. v. British Columbia</em>, 2017 SCC 32, [2017] 1
    S.C.R. 688, which in his view were unaffected by <em>Canada (Minister of
    Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</em>, 2019 SCC 65, 441 D.L.R. (4th) 1. The
    appeal judge found the majority’s interpretation of the Agreement was both reasonable
    and correct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge determined that the majority had not allowed the factual matrix to
    overwhelm the words of the contract and rejected OLG’s submission that the
    majority ignored provisions of the Agreement to reach a commercially absurd
    interpretation. He also held the majority did not err in deciding that the Agreement
    engaged the honour of the Crown, but in any event, noted that the majority’s reference
    to the doctrine was <em>obiter</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appeal judge held that the damages awarded by the majority were both reasonable
    and correct.</p>
  <h1>ISSUES</h1>

  <h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
  <p class=Heading>Issue #1: Did the appeal judge err as to the standard of
    review?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    and OLG assert that the appeal judge erred in concluding that the standard of
    review of the majority’s interpretation of the Agreement and its damages award is
    reasonableness. They say the appropriate standard of review, in the wake of <em>Vavilov</em>,
    is the appellate standard: correctness for questions of law and palpable and
    overriding error for questions of mixed fact and law.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    and OLG acknowledge that the Supreme Court in <em>Sattva</em>, at para.&nbsp;75,
    ruled that the standard of review in an appeal from a commercial arbitration
    conducted under the former <em>Arbitration Act</em>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 55, which
    was limited to a “question of law arising out of the award”, is “almost always”
    reasonableness; see also <em>Teal Cedar</em>, at para. 74.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[3]</span></span></span></a> They contend, however, that the reasonableness standard of review for questions
    of law prescribed by <em>Sattva</em> and <em>Teal Cedar</em> has been overtaken
    by <em>Vavilov</em>, where the majority ruled that an administrative decision subject
    to a statutory right of appeal should be reviewed under the appellate standard:
    correctness for questions of law, and palpable and overriding error for
    questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law where the legal principle
    is not readily extricable: at paras. 36-38, 44. They say <em>Vavilov</em> applies whenever the legislature has provided for a statutory appeal, such as under
    Ontario’s <em>Arbitration Act, 1991</em>, S.O. 1991, c. 17. They also claim
    that even if the reasonableness standard of review applies, the appeal judge
    erred in concluding that the majority’s decision was reasonable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The First
    Nations Partnership disputes the claim that <em>Vavilov</em> effectively
    overruled <em>Sattva</em> and <em>Teal Cedar</em> on the standard of review of a
    commercial arbitration decision on questions of law. It submits that <em>Vavilov</em> governs the standard of review in administrative law but does not apply to
    commercial arbitration decisions, which should continue to be reviewed under a
    deferential standard on questions of law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The First
    Nations Partnership’s more fundamental point, however, is that the standard of
    review does not affect the outcome of these appeals. It says that whether or
    not <em>Vavilov</em> applies to the review of a commercial arbitration
    decision, Ontario and OLG have largely raised questions of mixed fact and law —
    questions about the interpretation and application of the Agreement that do not
    involve extricable legal errors. It submits that a deferential standard of
    review applies to these questions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it is unnecessary in these appeals to address whether <em>Vavilov</em> changed the standard of review analysis in <em>Sattva</em> and <em>Teal Cedar</em> in an appeal from a commercial arbitration decision, for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    as I will address below, whether the standard of review on questions of law is
    reasonableness or correctness, the appeal judge did not err in upholding the
    majority’s decision. Because a court should generally refrain from deciding
    issues of law that are unnecessary to the resolution of an appeal (<em>Phillips
    v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy)</em>,
    [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97, at para. 6), I would not address the standard of review
    issue.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[4]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court took the same approach in <em>Wastech Services Ltd. v. Greater
    Sewerage and Drainage District</em>, 2021 SCC 7, 454 D.L.R. (4th) 1, at para.&nbsp;46,
    where the majority, <em>per</em> Kasirer J., declined to consider “the effect,
    if any, of <em>Vavilov</em> on the standard of review principles articulated in<em> Sattva</em> and <em>Teal Cedar</em>”, partly because the outcome of the case did
    not depend on the standard of review.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    I agree with the First Nations Partnership that, putting aside the extricable
    errors of law alleged, Ontario and OLG largely advance questions of contractual
    interpretation, which since <em>Sattva</em> it has been accepted are questions
    of mixed fact and law attracting a deferential standard of review. There has
    been no suggestion that <em>Vavilov</em> changed the law on this point, which is
    distinct from the issue of whether an arbitrator’s decision on a question of
    law is reviewable under a standard of reasonableness or under the appellate
    standard.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Corner
    Brook (City) v. Bailey</em>, 2021 SCC 29, 17 B.L.R. (6th) 1, <em>per</em> Rowe&nbsp;J.,
    the Supreme Court affirmed the direction from <em>Sattva</em> that a
    deferential standard of review applies to questions of mixed fact and law
    involving the interpretation of a contract. The court in <em>Corner Brook</em> underscored
    that “contractual interpretation is a fact specific exercise, and should be
    treated as a mixed question of fact and law for the purpose of appellate review,
    unless there is an ‘extricable question of law’”: at para. 44. As the court
    explained, “[e]xtricable questions of law in the context of contractual
    interpretation include ‘the application of an incorrect principle, the failure
    to consider a required element of a legal test, or the failure to consider a
    relevant factor’”: at para. 44 (citations omitted). The court also cautioned
    that “[t]he circumstances in which a question of law can be extracted will be
    uncommon. Whether something was or should have been within the common knowledge
    of the parties at the time the contract was entered into is a question of
    fact”: at para. 44 (citations omitted); see, to the same effect, <em>Sattva</em>,
    at paras. 50, 55; <em>Teal Cedar</em>, at paras. 47, 57.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the parties agree on the applicable principles of contractual interpretation. Where
    they disagree is how those principles should be applied to the contractual facts,
    consisting of the Agreement itself and the factual matrix or surrounding
    circumstances. Absent an extricable error of law, such an exercise of
    contractual interpretation by a first-instance decision maker — whether a court
    or an arbitrator — attracts appellate deference.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    now turn to whether the appeal judge erred in interpreting the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Issue #2: Did the appeal judge err in interpreting the Agreement?</p>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    and OLG submit that the appeal judge erred in law in interpreting the Agreement
    in four respects. First, they say he ignored their limited payment obligation
    under the Agreement. Second, they say his decision conflicts with the Agreement
    read as a whole. Third, they claim he failed to apply the entire agreement
    clause in the Agreement and to correct the majority’s decision to admit extrinsic
    evidence that overwhelmed the words of the Agreement. Fourth, in the
    alternative, OLG argues the appeal judge erred in affirming the majority’s
    damages award.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will first summarize the applicable principles of contractual interpretation
    and then address these four arguments. As I will elaborate, Ontario and OLG largely
    repeat arguments that the appeal judge rejected. I see no basis to reach a
    different conclusion.</p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applicable principles of contractual interpretation</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties
    agree that the appeal judge correctly stated the applicable principles of
    contractual interpretation. Those principles were discussed in the Supreme Court’s
    unanimous decisions in <em>Sattva</em>, <em>per</em> Rothstein J., and more recently
    in <em>Corner Brook</em>, <em>per</em> Rowe J. They may be summarized as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Courts should take
    “a practical, common-sense approach not dominated by technical rules of
    construction. The overriding concern is to determine ‘the intent of the parties
    and the scope of their understanding’”: <em>Sattva</em>, at para. 47 (citations
    omitted).</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Courts must
    “read the contract as a whole, giving the words used their ordinary grammatical
    meaning, consistent with the surrounding circumstances known to the parties at
    the time of formation of the contract”: <em>Sattva</em>, at para. 47; <em>Corner
    Brook</em>, at para. 20.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The surrounding
    circumstances should be considered in contractual interpretation. “[A]scertaining
    contractual intention can be difficult when looking at words on their own,
    because words do not have an immutable or absolute meaning”: <em>Sattva</em>,
    at para. 47. The meaning of words in a contract often derives from contextual
    factors, such as the purpose of the agreement and the nature of the
    relationship it creates: <em>Sattva</em>, at para.&nbsp;48. A contract is not made
    in a vacuum and must be placed in its proper setting. Interpreting a commercial
    contract requires knowledge of the commercial purpose of the contract, based on
    “the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, the market in
    which the parties are operating”: <em>Sattva</em>, at para. 47, citing <em>Reardon
    Smith Line Ltd. v. Hansen-Tangen</em><i>; <em>Hansen-Tangen v. Sanko Steamship
    Co.</em></i>, [1976] 3 All E.R. 570 (U.K. H.L.), at p. 574, <em>per</em> Lord
    Wilberforce.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature of
    the evidence that may be considered as part of the surrounding circumstances will
    vary from case to case, but should include only “objective evidence of the
    background facts at the time of the execution of the contract”, that is,
    “knowledge that was or reasonably ought to have been within the knowledge of
    both parties at or before the date of contracting”. That determination is
    inherently fact specific: <em>Sattva</em>, at paras. 55, 58 (citation omitted); <em>Corner Brook</em>, at para. 20.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The surrounding
    circumstances should never be allowed to overwhelm the words of the agreement.
    The surrounding circumstances are considered in order “to deepen a
    decision-maker’s understanding of the mutual and objective intentions of the
    parties as expressed in the words of the contract. The interpretation of a
    written contractual provision must always be grounded in the text and read in
    light of the entire contract”. Courts cannot use the surrounding circumstances
    to deviate from the text of the contract to the point that the court
    “effectively creates a new agreement”: <em>Sattva</em>, at para. 57; <em>Corner
    Brook</em>, at para. 20.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will now apply these principles to Ontario and OLG’s four contractual
    interpretation arguments.</p>
  <h5>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario and OLG’s contractual interpretation arguments</h5>
  <p class=MsoHeading8 style='line-height:normal'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Did the appeal judge ignore Ontario and OLG’s limited payment obligation
    under the Agreement?</i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Ontario and OLG assert that both the appeal judge and the majority ignored their
    limited payment obligation under the Agreement. They say several provisions of
    the Agreement confirm that they only have to pay the First Nations Partnership
    1.7% of gaming revenue, non-gaming revenue, and Comps received by OLG, so they do
    not have to pay any of the non-gaming revenue or Comps for the non-gaming
    amenities outsourced to private operators. They rely on:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>s. 2.2(a), which requires them to pay “1.7% of the aggregate Gross
    Revenues for all Agents of the Province in the applicable Preceding Fiscal
    Year”;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>s. 1.1(f), the definition of “Agent of the Province”, which
    includes OLG but excludes “any operator” that OLG “may hire to operate any
    gaming facility or to operate the conduct and [management] of such lottery
    schemes for or on behalf of the Province, OLG or such other agency of the
    Province”; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Schedule 1.1(nn), which provides that “Gross Revenues” means, in
    respect of an Agent of the Province, revenue reported on the audited
    Consolidated Financial Statements of that Agent of the Province but does not
    include revenues “received … [but] not retained to the final account of the
    Province, OLG or any such other Agent of the Province.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument was carefully considered and, in my view, correctly rejected by the appeal
    judge and the majority of the arbitration panel. Both highlighted that Schedule
    1.1(nn) expressly lists the three components of “Gross Revenues” as consisting
    of the revenues of an Agent of the Province generated from gaming revenue, non-gaming
    revenue, and Comps, even though Comps are not revenues received by OLG but are expenses.
    In other words, under the Agreement, revenue need not be received by OLG to be
    included as “Gross Revenues” for revenue sharing purposes. As the majority
    stated, and the appeal judge affirmed:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Schedule 1.1(nn) provides that for the purposes of the [Agreement],
    Gross Revenues of OLG are made up of the [gaming revenue] as well as ancillary [non-gaming
    revenue] and Comps <u>generated by the gaming conducted and managed by OLG as
    Agent of Ontario in 2008</u>. These three components are the base on which the [First
    Nations Partnership] share of 1.7% annually is calculated for the term of the [Agreement].
    Comps are included in the base, although they are not revenues received by OLG.
    That was the shared understanding of the parties in 2008. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The use
    of the year 2008 to determine the revenue and deemed revenue included as “Gross
    Revenues” arises from s. 2.4(c) of the Agreement, which requires OLG to
    calculate Gross Revenues “in accordance with the accounting practices and
    principles applied by OLG at the Effective Date”, the date of the Agreement —
    February 19, 2008. The parties agree that, on February 19, 2008, OLG included
    both non-gaming revenue and Comps as part of “Gross Revenues”, even though
    Comps were not received or retained by OLG. This date provided a benchmark for,
    or “snapshot” of, what was included as part of Gross Revenues. As the majority of
    the arbitration panel explained:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The reference in Schedule 1.1(nn) to what is reported in the
    “Segmented Information notes in the notes to, or as otherwise reported in, the
    audited Consolidated Financial Statements of that Agent of the Province” is a
    statement about the “snapshot” at the time the [Agreement] was made. That
    “snapshot” simply describes the components on which the payments owed to [the First
    Nations Partnership] are to be based. The words reflect the shared
    understanding of the parties in 2008, when the [Agreement] was made, of the
    sources of revenue to be shared with the First Nations.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>There is no language in Schedule 1.1(nn) nor any evidence of a
    shared intention of the parties in 2008, that this reference referred to what
    might appear in the audited Consolidated Financial Statements as they might be
    from time to time in future years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge found this interpretation to be commercially reasonable — and Ontario
    and OLG’s interpretation commercially unreasonable — because “[i]t would not be
    commercially reasonable to interpret the [Agreement] in a manner that allows
    OLG to turn off two of three revenue ‘taps’ because it can make a better deal
    in the private sector.” I agree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal
    judge also found the majority’s interpretation was “purposive”, and Ontario and
    OLG’s interpretation to be “non-purposive and technical”, because the majority considered
    the historical and relationship factors that underpinned the Agreement — to
    provide First Nations in Ontario with resources derived from lottery schemes in
    Ontario conducted and managed by Ontario, directly or indirectly, to advance
    their economic growth and development. Again, I agree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would add that it is inconceivable that the shared understanding of the parties
    when they entered the Agreement was that OLG, by outsourcing to private parties
    two of the three revenue sources in the definition of “Gross Revenues”, could pay
    First Nations nothing on account of these sources. I say this for two reasons.
    First, First Nations had agreed to settle a $2 billion claim in exchange for
    the Agreement to obtain stable funding for their communities. Part of that
    stability arose from having three carefully defined and locked-in revenue sources.
    Second, when the parties agreed to the Agreement they did not contemplate that it
    was legally possible for OLG to outsource responsibility for its non-gaming
    amenities to private operators. The scenario of paying nothing for outsourced non-gaming
    amenities thus could not have been within the reasonable contemplation of the
    parties. As the appeal judge found:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In 2008 when the [Agreement] was entered into, OLG did not
    contemplate that it could transfer responsibility for non-gaming amenities
    exclusively to private operators. It was only in 2011, as OLG conducted its
    strategic business review, that it concluded that OLG was permitted to fully
    outsource the provision of non-gaming amenities. This shift in OLG’s
    operational model was presented to and approved by the provincial Cabinet.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows that I would reject Ontario and OLG’s argument that the definition of
    “Agent of the Province” makes clear that the revenue of private third-party
    service providers to whom non-gaming amenities were outsourced after 2008 are
    excluded from “Gross Revenues”. As already noted, the parties did not
    contemplate the outsourcing of non-gaming amenities to be legally possible in
    2008. Moreover, s. 10.10(b) of the Agreement confirms Ontario and OLG’s ongoing
    revenue-sharing obligations if the Province reorganizes how it conducts and
    manages gaming. Lastly, evidence in the record suggests that the reference to
    private third-party operators in the definition of “Agent of the Province” was
    directed at excluding the revenue of four private resort casinos that OLG
    operated through private operators at the time the Agreement was agreed to.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    therefore see no error in how the appeal judge or the majority interpreted Ontario
    and OLG’s payment obligation under the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Did the appeal judge fail to read the Agreement as a whole?</i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Ontario and OLG assert that the appeal judge and the majority ignored other
    important terms of the Agreement — the non-derogation and final account clauses
    — and thus erred in law by failing to read the Agreement as a whole.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i><u>Non-derogation
    clause (s. 10.1)</u></i>. Ontario and OLG contend that the majority and appeal
    judge erred by ignoring the non-derogation clause. This provision preserves for
    Ontario and OLG full discretion and control over the conduct and management of
    OLG’s business, without guaranteeing a minimum level of revenue, any obligation
    on Ontario or OLG to continue to operate any particular business, or any
    obligation to make additional payments to the First Nations Partnership for a
    reduction in revenue because of a business change (s.&nbsp;10.1(b)(i)). Nor
    does the First Nations Partnership have any interest in any lottery scheme or
    any assets of Ontario or OLG (s. 10.1(b)(ii)). Ontario and OLG contend that
    nothing in the Agreement gives the First Nations Partnership a separate and
    ongoing right to receive a share of the revenue or value of Comps from
    non-gaming activities that OLG was operating in 2008, if OLG stops operating
    those businesses, receiving that revenue, or providing those Comps.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do
    not accept this submission. The majority expressly considered the non&#8209;derogation
    clause, concluding it contemplated that “there may be internal reorganizations
    of OLG but, notwithstanding that, the contractual rights of [the First Nations
    Partnership] remain intact.” The majority noted that “no one contests OLG’s
    right to modernize”, but “that does not give it the right to shed its obligations
    to [the First Nations Partnership]… [M]odernization does not displace [the]
    payment obligation. It coexists with it. By ceasing to pay amounts equal to
    1.7% annually of [non-gaming revenue] and Comps, OLG and Ontario have breached
    the [Agreement].” For his part, the appeal judge noted that Ontario and OLG repeated
    submissions “made before the arbitration panel that were considered and
    rejected by the majority who provided reasonable reasons for rejecting” them. I&nbsp;see
    no basis to impugn these conclusions or for this court to intervene.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i><u>Final
    account clause (s. 1(f) of Schedule 1.1(nn))</u></i>. The final account clause,
    which forms part of the definition of Gross Revenues, provides that “Gross
    Revenues shall not include any revenues received by the Province, OLG or any
    other Agent of the Province … to the extent that, such revenues so received are
    not retained to the final account of the Province, OLG or any such other Agent
    of the Province.” Ontario and OLG say the majority wrongly determined that this
    provision was of no assistance, and thus disregarded it. They say this
    provision helps in interpreting the scope of Gross Revenues, which must be
    revenues received by OLG and Ontario. They claim OLG has never recognized, let
    alone retained, third-party revenues generated at outsourced sites, which are
    expressly excluded by s. 1(f) of Schedule 1.1(nn).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do
    not agree with this submission. At first instance, all parties agreed the final
    account clause did not apply here and both Ontario and OLG stated in argument that
    they did not rely on the clause. Ontario’s counsel stated that the final
    account clause was “not an issue in this case because we are not relying on
    this ‘received but not retained’ clause to try to exclude revenue. We are not
    carving out or diverting using that provision.” The majority accepted this
    view, noting “the parties agree [this clause] is of no assistance here, because
    it addresses revenues received by OLG but not retained. That is not this case.”
    I agree. This case does not involve revenue being received by Ontario or OLG and
    then being diverted to third parties to avoid a payment obligation to the First
    Nations Partnership. There was thus no need for the arbitrators or the appeal
    judge to consider this clause any further.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8 style='line-height:normal'>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Did the appeal judge ignore the entire agreement clause and allow the
    extrinsic evidence to overwhelm the words of the Agreement?</i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    Ontario and OLG assert that the appeal judge and majority erred in law by
    admitting the pre-contractual negotiations into evidence — especially evidence
    of Ontario’s negotiator, former Minister Bryant, to the effect that Ontario and
    OLG’s diversion of the non-gaming revenue stream and the termination of the
    payment of an amount equal to Comps, two of the three revenue streams referred
    to in the Agreement, conflicted with the parties’ shared understanding. Ontario
    and OLG also argue that an “entire agreement” clause, s. 1.10, precludes reliance
    on any pre-contractual warranty, representation, opinion, advice, or assertion of
    fact.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do
    not agree with this submission. An entire agreement clause alone does not
    prevent a court from considering admissible evidence of the surrounding
    circumstances at the time of contract formation. As already noted, the surrounding
    circumstances are relevant in interpreting a contract exactly because “words
    alone do not have an immutable or absolute meaning”: <em>Sattva</em>, at para.
    47. Relevant background and context are often essential to understand contractual
    language. I&nbsp;therefore agree with the following observations of Fraser C.J.
    for a majority of the Court of Appeal of Alberta in <em>IFP Technologies
    (Canada) v. EnCana Midstream and Marketing</em>, 2017 ABCA 157, 53 Alta. L.R.
    (6th) 96, at para. 124, leave to appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 303:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The mere existence of an “entire agreement” provision does not
    mean that the words chosen beyond that entire agreement provision admit of one
    interpretation only. The purpose of considering the surrounding circumstances
    is not to add to, contradict or vary the terms of the agreement but rather use
    them as an interpretive aid to determine the meaning of the words in dispute.
    Where parties have concluded an agreement and a court is left to sort out the
    parties’ objective intentions, it cannot be prevented from considering the
    surrounding circumstances by a provision that is itself based on the assumption
    that the agreement is clear — when it is not.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant
    question, then, is whether the evidence considered by the majority was properly
    part of the surrounding circumstances. I again agree with Fraser C.J., that
    “[d]etermining what constitute properly surrounding circumstances is a question
    of fact”: <em>IFP Technologies</em>, at para. 83; see also <em>Sattva</em>, at
    paras. 49-55, 58; <em>Corner Brook</em>, at para. 44; and <em>Kilitzoglou v.
    Curé</em>, 2018 ONCA 891, 143 O.R. (3d) 385, at para. 37. Such a question of
    fact is outside this court’s jurisdiction, because the parties agreed to limit
    any appeals to questions of law or mixed fact and law: Agreement, s. 9.2.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    assuming, without deciding, that this is one of the “rare” or “uncommon” circumstances
    where a question of law can be extricated from the interpretation process (<em>Sattva</em>,
    at para. 55; <em>Corner Brook</em>, at para. 44), I see no error in how the surrounding
    circumstances were considered. These circumstances helped to place the Agreement
    in its proper setting and understand the genesis of the transaction, the
    background, and the context. They included the parties’ history of litigation
    over revenue sharing; their shared objective of locking&#8209;in three
    identified revenue streams to ensure stable, predictable, long-term funds for
    First Nations’ communities; and Ontario’s commitment not to convert revenues
    received to the final account of the Province into revenues that were not. Such
    evidence was admissible to show the parties’ objective mutual intention and the
    background facts leading to the Agreement. In my view, the surrounding
    circumstances were not used to overwhelm the words of the agreement or to
    deviate from the text to create a new agreement: see <em>Sattva</em>, at para.
    57.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore
    agree with the appeal judge, that “[w]hile the majority considered the
    surrounding circumstances, its interpretation of the [Agreement] was firmly
    rooted in the actual wording of the agreement”. The surrounding circumstances or
    matrix of facts were not determinative in interpreting the Agreement one way or
    the other: see <em>Corner Brook</em>, at para. 57.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude, I see force in the submission of the First Nations Partnership that Ontario
    and OLG have presented a “matrix-free” case — one that ignores the
    circumstances leading to the Agreement and the parties’ common objectives in
    entering this new long-term agreement to advance the growth and capacity of
    First Nations’ communities. I am not inclined to adopt such a “matrix-free”
    approach.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Did the appeal judge err in awarding damages?</i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in the alternative, OLG submits that if the appeal judge was correct in holding
    that Ontario and OLG breached the Agreement, he failed to correct errors in the
    damages awarded. OLG says the majority’s order that Ontario and OLG pay 1.7% of
    non-gaming revenue and Comps at all gaming facilities in Ontario is not compensatory
    but instead gives the First Nations Partnership a windfall — it puts it in a
    better position than it would have been in had the Agreement been performed, because
    modernization is projected to generate more revenue and therefore greater
    payments to the First Nations Partnership. OLG says the proper measure of
    damages is to put the First Nations Partnership in the position it would have
    been in but for the breach, based on OLG’s reasonable expectations of lower projected
    revenue before modernization. On OLG’s approach, the First Nations Partnership’s
    damages should be zero.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do
    not accept this submission. In my view, the appeal judge appropriately affirmed
    the majority’s damages order. Under the expectation measure of damages for
    contractual breach, the First Nations Partnership had a right to be put in the
    position it would have been in had the Agreement been performed: see <em>Bank
    of America Canada v. Mutual Trust Co.</em>, 2002 SCC 43, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 601,
    at paras. 26-27; <em>Dasham Carriers Inc. v. Gerlach</em>, 2013 ONCA 707, 313
    O.A.C. 95, at paras. 17, 28-30. Ontario and OLG breached the Agreement by
    failing to pay the First Nations Partnership the agreed upon 1.7% of gaming
    revenue, non-gaming revenue, and Comps from gaming sites conducted and managed
    by OLG. The majority’s award, as affirmed by the appeal judge, requires Ontario
    and OLG to pay exactly that amount.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such
    an award does not overcompensate the First Nations Partnership and gives it only
    what it bargained for under the Agreement. As the majority held, and the appeal
    judge affirmed: “[The First Nations Partnership] bargained for a percentage of [gaming
    revenue, non-gaming revenue], and Comps. If the value of any one of those ‘streams’
    goes up or down, [the First Nations Partnership] is entitled to the increased
    benefit or required to suffer the loss that results. This is not a net benefit
    exercise.” I see no error in that reasoning or conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would also reject OLG’s claim that any damages should be limited to the value
    of non-gaming revenue and Comps that the First Nations Partnership would have
    received had OLG not modernized. OLG did not breach the Agreement through modernization.
    It breached the Agreement when it stopped paying the First Nations Partnership two
    of the three agreed upon types of revenue. I see no basis to intervene with the
    appeal judge’s conclusion that the majority’s award compensates for that breach.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Issue #3: Did the appeal judge err in applying the honour of
    the Crown?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Ontario and OLG claim that the appeal judge erred in agreeing with the majority
    that the honour of the Crown was relevant to the interpretation of the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    honour of the Crown is “a foundational principle of Aboriginal law and governs
    the relationship between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples”: <em>Mikisew Cree
    First Nation v. Canada (Governor General in Council)</em>, 2018 SCC 40, [2018]
    2 S.C.R. 765, at para. 21. It obliges servants of the Crown to “conduct
    themselves with honour when acting on behalf of the sovereign” with Aboriginal
    peoples: <em>Manitoba Métis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>,
    2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623, at para. 65. The ultimate purpose of the
    honour of the Crown is “the reconciliation of pre-existing Aboriginal societies
    with the assertion of Crown sovereignty”: <em>Manitoba Métis Federation</em>,
    at para. 66; <em>R. v. Desautel</em>, 2021 SCC 17, 456 D.L.R. (4th) 1, at
    paras. 22, 30; and <em>Newfoundland and Labrador (Attorney General) v.
    Uashaunnuat (Innu of Uashat and of Mani-Utenam)</em>, 2020 SCC 4, 443 D.L.R.
    (4th) 1, at paras. 22-24.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    and OLG claim the Agreement is a commercial agreement that does not engage the
    honour of the Crown. They note the Agreement expressly states it is not a
    treaty and does not create any treaty or fiduciary relationship between the Crown
    and Aboriginal peoples. They also contend the appeal judge erred by ruling that
    the Agreement represented “the reconciliation of the constitutionally protected
    Aboriginal right of self-government, which includes jurisdiction over gaming,
    with the Crown’s sovereignty over gaming under the <em>Criminal Code</em>.” Ontario
    and OLG note that no such right has been recognized by a Canadian court or by
    the arbitration panel, nor was this issue meaningfully argued before the appeal
    judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    its part, the First Nations Partnership says that neither the arbitration panel
    nor the appeal judge relied on the honour of the Crown in reaching their
    decisions. It asserts that because their observations on this point were
    expressly identified as <em>obiter dicta</em>, this ground of appeal should
    fail. However, if the court is inclined to address this point, it submits that
    the Agreement does engage the honour of the Crown, which is always at stake in
    the Crown’s dealings with Aboriginal peoples. It claims the Agreement is not
    merely a commercial agreement but a government-to-government agreement, forged
    in partnership and negotiated in solemn gatherings between the Crown and First
    Nations conducted in accordance with First Nations’ traditions. It submits that
    although First Nations have an inherent right to self-government, whether that right
    includes jurisdiction over gaming was not before the arbitration panel or
    appeal judge and is not in issue in this case. It says this important issue should
    not be decided without a full factual record and complete argument.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would decline to address the honour of the Crown on the facts of this case, for
    two reasons. First, both the majority of the arbitration panel and the appeal
    judge expressly noted that their comments on the honour of the Crown were <em>obiter</em> and thus unnecessary for their rulings. A court should generally refrain from
    addressing a legal issue, and especially a constitutional issue, that is
    unnecessary to dispose of a case: <em>Phillips</em>, at paras. 6-9; <em>R. v.
    Drury</em>, 2020 ONCA 502, 391 C.C.C. (3d) 18, at para. 84. A policy of
    restraint is desirable because “unnecessary constitutional pronouncements may
    prejudice future cases, the implications of which have not been foreseen”: <em>Phillips</em>,
    at para. 9.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    as explained above, the appeal judge did not err in dismissing the appeals based
    on ordinary principles of contractual interpretation, without recourse to the
    honour of the Crown doctrine.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    quite apart from the honour of the Crown, I conclude the appeal judge made no
    reviewable error in dismissing the appeals based on ordinary principles of
    contractual interpretation.</p>
  <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appeals.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span

    days of this decision. Ontario and OLG may each do likewise within a further seven

  <p class=MsoBodyText align=center style='text-align:center'><b>GROSS REVENUES</b></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>1. For purposes of this Agreement, “Gross Revenues” means,
    in respect of an Agent of the Province (including OLG), the revenues of that
    Agent of the Province, before the deduction of promotional allowances, as
    reported in the Segmented Information notes in the notes to, or as otherwise
    reported in, the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of that Agent of the
    Province and generated from the following:</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><br>
    (a) Lotteries, including on-line games, sports games, instant games and bingo
    gaming;</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>(b) Slot machines and table games at casinos and
    racetracks; and</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>(c) Non-gaming activities ancillary to the conduct and
    management of Lottery Schemes, including hotel, food, beverage and other
    services, including the retail value of accommodation, food and beverage
    services and other services provided to gaming patrons on a complimentary
    basis.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>Notwithstanding the foregoing and for greater certainty:</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>(d) Gross Revenues generated from lotteries, slot machines
    and table games and non-gaming activities as set out above shall, for the
    purposes of this Agreement, be determined in accordance with the OLG revenue
    recognition accounting practices and principles set out in section 2 of this
    Schedule 1.1(nn) notwithstanding any changes from and after the date of this
    Agreement in such accounting practices or principles by OLG or any other Agent

    principle is not addressed in section 2 of this Schedule 1.1(nn), that
    accounting practice or principle applied by OLG as at March 15, 2006 shall be
    used.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>(e) Gross Revenues shall include any revenues generated
    front the conduct and management of any Lottery Scheme in existence as of March
    15, 2006 and any Lottery Scheme which is a new product offering for the
    Province or any Agent of the Province (for the purposes of this Schedule
    1.1(nn), a “New Lottery Scheme”) that comes into existence from and after March
    15, 2006, which revenues generated from such New Lottery Scheme shall be
    determined in accordance with the accounting practices and principles applied

    other Agent of the Province, as the ease may be, at the time such New Lottery
    Scheme comes into existence.</p>

    the Province. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>2. Revenue from lottery games, for which results are
    determined based on a draw, is recognized when the draw takes place. Revenue
    for future draws is deferred and recognized when the draw takes place. Revenue
    from instant games is recognized when the ticket is activated for play by the
    retailer. Revenue from sports wagering games and bingo gaming is recognized
    when the ticket is sold to the consumer. Tickets issued as a result of the
    redemption of free ticket prizes are not recorded as revenue.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>Gaming revenue from slot and table game operations
    represents the net win from gaming activities, which is the difference between
    amounts earned through gaming wagers less the payouts from those wagers.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>Non-gaming revenue includes revenue from hotel, food and
    beverage, entertainment centre and other services and is recognized at the time
    the services are rendered to patrons. This also includes the retail value of

    setting forth, with particularity, the Claimant’s position with respect to the
    Dispute and the material facts upon which the Claimant intends to rely;</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>(b) within 15 days after the delivery of the Statement,
    each Respondent shall deliver to the Claimant and the Arbitrators a written
    response (an “Answer”) to the Statement setting forth, with particularity, the
    Respondent’s position on the Dispute and the material facts upon which the
    Respondent intends to rely;</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>(c) if any Respondent fails to deliver an Answer within
    the time limit in paragraph 9 (b), that Respondent shall be deemed to have
    waived any right to provide an Answer to the Statement and the arbitration may
    continue without further notice to that Respondent;</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>(d) within 10 days after the earlier of: (i) the day all
    Answers have been delivered, and (ii) the 15th day referred to in paragraph
    9(b), the Claimant may deliver to all the Respondents and the Arbitrators a
    written reply (a “Reply”) to the Answer of each Respondent, setting forth, with
    particularity, the Claimant’s response, if any, to the Answer;</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>(e) within the time limit in paragraph 9(b), a Respondent
    may also deliver to the Claimant, each other Respondent and the Arbitrators a
    counter-statement (a “Counter-Statement”) setting forth, with particularity,
    any additional Dispute for the Arbitrators to decide. Within 15 days of the
    delivery of a Counter-Statement, the Claimant shall deliver to each Respondent
    and the Arbitrators an Answer to the Counter-Statement. If the Claimant fails
    to deliver an Answer to the Counter-Statement within such 15-day period, the

    Counter-Statement. Within 10 days after the delivery of an Answer to the
    Counter-Statement, the Respondents may deliver to the Claimant and the
    Arbitrators a Reply to such Answer. Any Dispute submitted to arbitration in
    accordance with this paragraph 9(e) shall be governed by, and dealt with as if

    other Party or Parties shall be given an opportunity to make submissions on the
    application.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>The Parties to the Agreement have set the time limits in
    this paragraph 9 after due consideration of the amount of time necessary to
    complete each step and it is their express desire that no extension of any time
    limit shall be granted except in extraordinary circumstances, the onus for the
    proof of the existence of which lies on the Party seeking an extension.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><b>CASE CONFERENCES</b></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>10. Within 10 days of the appointment of the three
    Arbitrators, the Chair shall convene a case conference for the determination of
    any preliminary or interlocutory matter or to provide for planning and
    scheduling of the arbitration or to determine the timing or desirability of expert
