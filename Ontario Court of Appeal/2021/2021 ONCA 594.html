  <p class=Judge><strong>Thorburn J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal is about whether the insurer appellant,
    Factory Mutual Insurance Company (“FM Global”), is required to provide
    insurance coverage for losses arising from an unplanned shutdown of the Atomic
    Energy of Canada Limited (“AECL”) Nuclear Research Universal (“NRU”) reactor located
    in Chalk River, Ontario on May 14, 2009.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent MDS Inc. is a global health
    science company. The respondent MDS (Canada) Inc. is its Canadian subsidiary.
    They are together referred to as “MDS”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On February 21, 2006, MDS agreed to buy radioisotopes
    from AECL to be produced at the NRU reactor located in Chalk River, Ontario. They
    were to be sold worldwide for cardiac imaging, cancer treatments, and
    sterilization of medical products.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>FM Global issued MDS an all-risk insurance
    policy which covers all risks of physical loss or damage to property and
    contingent time element coverage resulting from a supplier’s business
    interruption (“the Policy”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This was a standard form policy and there was no
    negotiation of the terms of insurance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Policy excludes coverage for losses caused
    by “corrosion”. The term “corrosion” is not defined. The Policy includes an exception
    from this exclusion for resulting “physical damage not excluded by this Policy”
    at specified locations. The parties agree that the NRU constitutes property of
    the type insured under the Policy’s extended coverage. The Policy limit for the
    relevant coverage (the Contingent Time Element Extended coverage) is US$25,000,000.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 14, 2009, heavy water containing
    radioactive tritium was discovered leaking through the calandria wall of the NRU
    reactor. The reactor was shut down for 15 months to repair the leak. The leak
    was caused by corrosion. As a result of the shutdown, MDS lost its supplier of radioisotopes
    and lost profits of approximately CA$121,248,000.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 21, 2009, MDS submitted a claim for lost
    profits. FM Global denied coverage on August 4, 2009, on the basis that this
    claim was excluded under the Policy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The central issues at trial were (i) the
    interpretation of the corrosion exclusion in the Policy and (ii) whether MDS’
    business losses arising from the shutdown of the NRU reactor are payable
    pursuant to the exception to the exclusion for physical damage caused by
    corrosion.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>[1]</span></span></span></a></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge held that (i) the term
    “corrosion” is ambiguous and should be interpreted in light of the dictionary
    definition of the term as modified by the “reasonable expectations of the
    parties”, (ii) the exclusion does not apply to unanticipated and “fortuitous
    corrosion”; it only applies to “non-fortuitous anticipated corrosion”; and (iii)
    the exception to the “corrosion” exclusion for “physical damage” should be
    interpreted broadly to include not just physical damage caused by the corrosion
    but economic loss caused by the inability to use the insured property during
    the shutdown.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>She therefore concluded that MDS’ losses were
    covered under the Policy and, in addition to damages up to the Policy’s limit, MDS
    should be awarded prejudgment interest at the rate of the company’s actual cost
    of borrowing, including compound interest at 5.14 percent, as she held this was
    “just compensation”. Prejudgment interest was assessed at US$14,821,338. MDS
    was awarded US$39,821,338 (the US$25,000,000 allowable limit plus interest in
    the amount of US$14,821,338) which, at the date of the release of the decision,
    amounted to CA$56,406,911.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I find that the trial
    judge erred in finding that the term “corrosion” is ambiguous and in deciding
    that losses other than physical damages are covered. Read in the context of the
    Policy as a whole, the meaning of the word “corrosion” is clear. The corrosion
    exclusion applies and MDS’ losses are not covered by the Policy. Likewise, the
    term “physical damage” in the exception to the exclusion clause is clear. It
    does not apply to economic losses caused by the inability to use the equipment
    during the shutdown. I would therefore allow the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>THE ISSUES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issues to be addressed on this appeal include:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The standard of review to be applied to the interpretation of this insurance
    Policy and the award of prejudgment interest;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The interpretation of the Policy and in particular:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpFirst>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether the trial judge erred in concluding that the term “corrosion”
    was ambiguous and should be interpreted to mean “the anticipated and
    predictable process of corroding”; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpLast>b.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether she erred in finding that the exception to the exclusion for
    “physical damage” caused by corrosion in the Policy was ambiguous and should be
    interpreted to include loss of use; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether she erred in awarding compound prejudgment interest at the rate
    of actual borrowing costs although this was not contemplated in the Policy
    agreement.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:200%'>THE FIRST ISSUE: STANDARD OF
    REVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:200%'>The standard of review when
    interpreting insurance agreements</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Typically, the interpretation of a contract
    attracts a deferential standard of appellate review. The trial judge’s interpretation
    of the agreement is reviewed for palpable and overriding error, as the contract
    is to be construed in light of the factual matrix and the trial judge is better
    placed to answer questions of mixed fact and law. Correctness review only
    applies to extricable errors of law in the trial court’s interpretation: see <em>Sattva
    Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp.</em>, 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, at
    paras. 50-55.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, standard form contracts, such as FM
    Global’s “Global Advantage” insurance policy, are an exception to the usual
    rule. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Ledcor Construction Ltd. v.
    Northbridge Indemnity Insurance Co.,</em> 2016 SCC 37, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 23, at
    para. 24:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[W]here an appeal involves the interpretation of a standard
    form contract, the interpretation at issue is of precedential value, and there
    is no meaningful factual matrix that is specific to the parties to assist the
    interpretation process, this interpretation is better characterized as a
    question of law subject to correctness review.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The factual matrix is less relevant in standard
    form contracts, such as insurance policies, because, as Wagner J. (as he then
    was) explained, <a name="_Hlk80626597">“the parties do not negotiate terms and
    the contract is put to the receiving party as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition”: <em>Ledcor, </em>at para. 28, citing <em>MacDonald v. Chicago Title Insurance
    Company of Canada, </em>2015 ONCA 842, 127 O.R. (3d) 663, at para. 33, leave to
    appeal refused, [2016] S.C.C.A. No. 39.</a> Moreover, “factors such as the
    purpose of the contract, the nature of the relationship it creates, and the
    market or industry in which it operates” are usually the same for all parties
    to a particular standard form contract, which “underscores the need for
    standard form contracts to be interpreted consistently”: <em>Ledcor, </em>at
    para. 31.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The interpretation of a contract may be a
    question of mixed fact and law, subject to deferential review on appeal, if the
    parties negotiated and modified what was initially a standard form contract. In
    these circumstances, the interpretation will likely be of little or no
    precedential value. The question is whether the dispute is over a general
    proposition or a particular set of circumstances of little or no precedential
    value: <em>Ledcor</em>, at para. 48.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>MDS concedes that the standard of review for the
    interpretation of a standard form policy that is not subject to negotiations is
    correctness, but argues that, as there are questions of mixed fact and law in
    dispute, the trial judge’s interpretation should be reviewed for palpable and
    overriding error. According to MDS’ written submissions, the trial judge’s
    interpretation was based on numerous findings of mixed fact and law, including:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he structure of the policy, that the leak was fortuitous,
    that the corrosion exclusion was listed along with other gradual physical
    processes, that the insurer chose not to define the term “corrosion” and that
    the reasonable expectations of the insurer was that this exclusion would not
    exclude all corrosion. And finally and importantly, that the all risk policy
    covers all fortuitous events, unless clearly excluded. It would also include the
    fact that the appellant, at trial and on discovery, categorically stated that
    the “corrosion exclusion” did not apply to <u>all corrosion</u>. [Emphasis in
    original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I disagree. The structure of the Policy, the
    fact that the leak was fortuitous, and the placement of the word corrosion with
    other gradual physical processes in the wording of the Policy are not in
    dispute. The only issues in dispute are the interpretation of (i) the
    “corrosion” exclusion, and (ii) the “physical damage” exception to the
    corrosion exclusion in the Policy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is a standard form policy, there was no
    negotiation of the terms of the Policy by the parties, and the issues are of
    general importance to all insurers and insured parties who use this Policy. This
    court’s interpretation of the Policy is of precedential value given that it is issued
    to many both within and beyond Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    result, must certainly be taken as the interpretation which would promote the

    intentions of the parties and their objective in entering into the commercial
    transaction in the first place should be discarded in favour of an
    interpretation of the policy which promotes a sensible commercial result. It is

    protection nugatory, should be avoided. Said another way, the courts should be

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the exception to the exclusion are unambiguous, the corrosion exclusion covers
    non-fortuitous corrosion, and the trial judge’s interpretation is inconsistent
    with prevailing authorities and is commercially unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent MDS, submits that the “corrosion”
    exclusion applies only to non-fortuitous corrosion. Although corrosion is not
    defined in the Policy, it is listed along with depletion, deterioration, and
    wear-and-tear, all of which are gradual processes. MDS reasonably expected that
    some corrosion would be covered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>MDS claims the losses it sustained during the
    NRU reactor shutdown were covered because: (i) the corrosion exclusion in
    5(C)(3) only excluded coverage for anticipated or non-fortuitous corrosion;
    unanticipated or fortuitous corrosion was <u>not</u> excluded; and (ii) even if
    the corrosion exclusion<em> </em><u>does</u> apply to unanticipated corrosion,
    the exception in 5(C) applies because the leak of heavy water and the reactor’s
    resulting shutdown were resulting physical damage. Thus, either the
    unanticipated corrosion or the resulting physical damage entitled MDS to the
    US$25,000,000 limit in the Contingent Time Element Extended section of the
    Policy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One of FM Global’s supervisors testified that
    the cause of corrosion matters in determining coverage. In discovery, when asked
    whether the Policy excluded coverage for all corrosion, he replied, “I don’t
    know that that’s accurate.… I’m trying to think of a situation where we would
    cover it.… I can’t blanketly [<em>sic</em>] characterize that all corrosion
    caused by any situation, like, would – always be excluded.” At trial, he added,
    as an example, that flash corrosion resulting from a sprinkler leak would be a
    situation where the Policy would cover corrosion as a direct result of an
    insured peril. Similarly, the May 27, 2009 email from an FM Global underwriter suggested
    that damages resulting from fortuitous corrosion might be covered in some
    circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>MDS therefore argues that the trial judge

    all claims save for those that are specifically excluded, this does not mean that
    the interpretation of clear terms should be changed. All-risk policies are, by

    Supreme Court held in <em>Canadian National Railway Co. v. Royal and Sun

  <p class=CQuote>These words [“all-risk”] cannot, of course, be held to cover

    be due to some fortuitous circumstance or casualty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, contrary to the trial judge’s
    assertion, the fact that two employees of the insurer stated that there might
    be circumstances in which losses involving corrosion might be covered does not
    mean the term is ambiguous; rather, it means that while loss or damage <u>caused</u> by corrosion is not covered, there may be circumstances where <u>corrosion may
    result from another cause</u> and thereby be covered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, even if employees did believe there was
    coverage for damages caused by corrosion (and there is no evidence that they
    did), the subjective belief of a party long after the standard form policy was
    entered into, absent other circumstances, is not evidence of the reasonable intention
    of the parties at the time the contract was entered into.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, unlike <em>Hi-Tech,</em> which was
    referred to by the trial judge, the term “corrosion”, while undefined in the
    Policy, has a plain and ordinary meaning. I&nbsp;therefore find that it is
    clear and unambiguous that physical loss or damage caused by corrosion is a
    loss that is specifically excluded from coverage in the Policy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, I find that the trial judge erred in concluding
    that fortuitous or unanticipated corrosion is covered by the Policy for the
    following reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was not a negotiated agreement and, in any event, no evidence was
    adduced as to the understanding of the parties at the time the Policy was
    entered into in 1985. There is therefore no evidence to assist in understanding<span
style='color:black'> the way in which the language of the Policy would have
    been understood by a reasonable person at the time the Policy was signed</span>;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Policy should therefore be interpreted in accordance with the terms
    of the Policy read in context;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dictionary definition of corrosion includes “wear away, esp. by
    chemical action.” It is not limited to anticipated corrosion but includes any
    kind of wearing away;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The clear and unambiguous meaning of the term “corrosion” is not altered
    by other provisions in the Policy;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that two FM Global employees believed there might be coverage
    for unanticipated corrosion at the time the corrosion was discovered does not
    render the term ambiguous. As noted above, there is no coverage where the loss
    was caused by corrosion, as it was in this case. By contrast, there may be
    coverage if the damage is caused by an insured peril such as a sprinkler
    leakage and that damage in turn results in corrosion, to use the example
    provided by one of FM Global’s witnesses. Moreover, opinions of employees many
    years after the agreement was signed, do not, of themselves, alter the reasonable
    expectations of the parties when the Policy agreement was entered into. (In any
    event, FM Global’s senior supervisor in Toronto simply said that “[s]ome causes
    can trigger coverage for some types of corrosion.” He was not cross-examined on
    the causes or “types of peril”. This statement is consistent with FM Global’s point
    that “the corrosion exclusion would not apply if the corrosion was itself
    precipitated by an insured peril”);</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defining “corrosion” to include both anticipated and unanticipated
    corrosion is consistent with commercial reality, the clear terms of the Policy,
    and the need to interpret standard form policies consistently and objectively <span
style='color:black'>because “the parties do not negotiate terms and the
    contract is put to the receiving party as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition”: </span><em>Ledcor</em><i><span
style='color:black'>, </span></i><span style='color:black'>at para. </span>28,
    citing <em>MacDonald</em>, at para. 33<span style='color:black'>. To allow one
    party’s subjective intention of the meaning to alter the plain meaning</span> of
    the term would enable one party to define terms in a standard form contract for
    many other insurers and insured: <em>Ledcor</em>, at para. 40;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the Policy is a standard form contract, used in many
    jurisdictions, consistency of interpretation is desirable;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above, Canadian courts have long looked to other jurisdictions
    for guidance, particularly where the same contracts are used in multiple
    jurisdictions. This is in keeping with the desire for consistency and stability.
    American courts have consistently adopted a plain meaning approach to the term
    “corrosion” that includes both anticipated and unanticipated corrosion;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the corrosion exclusion were interpreted to apply only to
    non-fortuitous or anticipated corrosion (as the trial judge held), the
    exclusion would be meaningless as non-fortuitous or anticipated corrosion is
    not covered in the first place. This is because all damage covered by all-risk
    policies must be fortuitous: <em>Canadian National Railway Co.</em>, at para. 79;
    and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s interpretation may also create an incentive to avoid
    detection of corrosion as, if only non-fortuitous or anticipated corrosion is
    excluded from coverage, there would be little incentive to maintain equipment
    to avoid the risk of unanticipated corrosion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I conclude that the term “corrosion”
    is not ambiguous and should have been interpreted in a manner consistent with the

    the coverage, the nature of the relationship it creates, and the industry in
    which it operates: <em>Ledcor</em>,<em> </em>at paras. 28-29 and 31. Instead,
    the trial judge modified the term based on her interpretation of remarks made

  <p class=CQuote>The Policy must be considered as a whole. The other provisions
    of the Policy including the loss of use exceptions, and the Contingent Time
    Coverage provisions, with specific regard to the period of liability when read
    with the resulting physical damage exception, all appear to confirm that loss
    of use of the NRU caused by the leak of heavy water would constitute resulting
    physical damage. The effect of the leak of heavy water rendered the NRU
    inoperable until the safety concerns and protocol imposed by the CNSC had been
    met.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In assessing the objective reasonable expectation of the
    parties as to the meaning of physical damage, it makes common sense that if the
    unanticipated leak of heavy water from the calandria precipitates the shutdown
    of the NRU ordered by the CNSC to study and rectify the problem causing the
    leak, that this circumstance rendering the NRU inoperable would constitute
    resulting physical damage.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Applying the principles of <em>Ledcor</em><i> </i>to interpret

  <p class=CQuote>This interpretation is in accordance with the purpose of

    United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co.</em>, 508 F. (2d) 417 (7th Cir. Ct.

    machinery is not injured or destroyed tangible property and, therefore, there is
    no ‘property damage’ within the coverage of the policy.” Similarly, in <em>MRI
    Healthcare</em>, the Court of Appeal of California held that a “physical” damage
    exception to exclusion does not cover claims where “the insured merely suffers
    a detrimental economic impact unaccompanied by a distinct, demonstrable,
    physical alteration of the property”: at p. 779, citing <em>Couch on Insurance</em>,
    loose-leaf, 3d ed. (Thomson Reuters, 2010) at s. 148:81 (footnotes omitted). Thus,
    the fact that a machine was turned off and could not be turned back on was not
    “direct physical loss”.</span></p>

    under a policy for “physical damage to physical property” “is confined to

    consequences’”.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis of the interpretation of the exception to exclusion from          coverage
    for corrosion and conclusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Supreme Court held in <em>Ledcor</em><i>, </i>at
    para. 52, citing <i>Progressive Homes, </i>at paras. 26-29 and 51, that: “the
    insured has the onus of first establishing that the damage or loss claimed
    falls within the initial grant of coverage. The onus then shifts to the insurer
    to establish that one of the exclusions to coverage applies. If the insurer is
    successful at this stage, the onus then shifts back to the insured to prove
    that an exception to the exclusion applies.” Although exceptions are
    interpreted broadly, particularly in all-risk policies, this does not mean that
    clear wording should be altered. For the reasons that follow, I find that the
    exception to the corrosion exclusion does not include coverage for economic
    loss:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The exception to the exclusion for corrosion is restricted to “resulting
    physical damage” to MDS’ insured property or that of its suppliers. The plain
    meaning of physical damage does not include economic loss.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A contextual analysis of the Policy does not lead to a broader
    interpretation of “resulting physical damage” because:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>          (a) Damage
    for “loss of market or loss of use, except to the extent     provided by this
    Policy” is specifically excluded from coverage;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>          (b) The
    Contingent Time Element provision that allows for loss of      profits only
    applies to insured claims; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>(c) A
    reasonable interpretation of the exception to the corrosion exclusion in this
    all-risk Policy is that, while lost profits are not covered, the provision does
    cover all costs to repair physical damage.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The preponderance of cases in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom
    have not interpreted resulting physical damage to extend beyond physical
    repairs to include loss of use. On the contrary, they have held that where loss
    of use is to be included as resulting physical damage, this must be made clear
    in the policy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The only resulting physical damage was the leak
    in the calandria wall caused by corrosion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge accepted that “the presence of
    the leaking heavy water in the J-rod annulus did not cause actual tangible
    damage in the interior of the J-rod annulus”: at para. 447. The trial judge
    also held that “the J-rod annulus, with its sump pump, was not physically
    damaged by the leak of heavy water in the literal sense”: at para. 492.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge relied on the American decision
    in <em>MRI Healthcare</em> to conclude that the resulting loss of use
    constituted resulting physical damage. That case, however, does not support the
    proposition that economic loss should be covered under an exception to an exclusion
    for resulting physical damage. On the contrary, the court concluded that there
    is no resulting physical damage to be covered where the detrimental impact is
    “unaccompanied by a distinct, demonstrable, physical alteration of the
    property”: at p. 779, citing <em>Couch on Insurance</em>. As such, although the
    leak resulted in the shutdown, the shutdown itself is not resulting physical
    damage. To read in coverage for “loss of use” distorts the plain language of
    the Policy and is out of step with the above case law.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I find that the exception to
    the corrosion exclusion for resulting physical damage includes physical damage,
    but not damage resulting from loss of use. While economic loss may result from
    physical damage, it is not physical damage.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:
