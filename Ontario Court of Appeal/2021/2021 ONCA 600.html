  <p align=center style='
text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS
    FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.C. was convicted after trial of human
    trafficking-related charges involving two victims, one an adult and the other a
    minor. He was also convicted of assaulting the adult victim, and of child
    pornography charges relating to the child victim. The trial judge imposed a
    global sentence of 6 years in custody for the 12&nbsp;charges for which C.C. was
    found guilty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.C. seeks leave to appeal that sentence. He
    does not claim that the sentence was unfit, or identify any errors relating to
    the trial judge’s identification of the global sentence. Nonetheless, he asks
    to have his sentence reduced. He argues that the trial judge erred in failing
    to mitigate his sentence because of the harsh conditions of bail he had been
    under, pursuant to the decision in <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Downes </em>(2006), 79
    O.R. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.). He urges, in the alternative, that fresh evidence
    underscores his rehabilitative potential and provides an exceptional basis upon
    which this court should revisit his sentence, even if the trial judge committed
    no error. The fresh evidence C.C. relies upon includes letters of support from his
    family and community, an affidavit confirming his remorse, and proof of the
    counselling he has taken and the employment opportunities he has developed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We are not persuaded by either submission.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, we do not accept C.C.’s contention that the
    trial judge failed to consider whether C.C.’s sentence should be mitigated as a
    result of the punitive terms of bail he was under. The trial judge stated
    explicitly that she decided not to credit C.C. for those restrictive bail conditions,
    and she gave reasons for not doing so. C.C.’s submission is based on the
    mistaken belief that there is a difference between a <em>Downes </em>credit and
    treating harsh conditions of bail as a mitigating factor. There is not. As this
    court explained in <em>R. v. Joseph</em>, 2020 ONCA 733, 153 O.R. (3d) 145, at
    para. 108:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Although it is not uncommon to speak of
    providing “credit” for stringent bail conditions, “pre-trial bail is
    conceptually a mitigating factor” in assessing a fit sentence: <em>R. v. Yue</em> (2007), 226 C.C.C. (3d) 349 (Ont. C.A.). Mitigation is given because stringent
    bail conditions can be punitive and therefore “akin” to custody: <em>Downes</em>,
    at para. 29.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk81320954"><span lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Some judges choose to achieve that mitigation by
    granting a “<em>Downes </em>credit” that is set off against the sentence that
    would otherwise have been imposed. Other judges choose to factor the punitive impact
    that bail conditions have had on the offender into their overall determination
    of a fit sentence. </span></a><span lang=EN-CA>Neither approach is in error. In
    this case, the trial judge explained why she would not grant a credit for the
    stringent bail conditions C.C. had been under. In doing so, she gave the
    requisite consideration to whether to exercise discretion to reduce C.C.’s
    sentence because of those conditions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.C. makes a secondary argument relating to <em>Downes </em>credit. He contends that the sentencing judge erred by relying on the fact
    that she sentenced C.C. concurrently as a reason for denying <em>Downes </em>credit.
    This argument is more compelling. The factors that drove the trial judge to
    sentence C.C. concurrently, namely, the close link between the offences, and
    the fact that consecutive sentences would be too harsh and would interfere with
    C.C.’s rehabilitation, have nothing to do with whether a lesser sentence should
    be imposed because the offender has already received some punishment through
    stringent bail conditions. However, the trial judge offered another correct and
    persuasive reason for not reducing C.C.’s sentence. She concluded that <em>Downes</em> credit should not be given because of the totality principle. Put otherwise,
    she determined that if the global sentence fell below six years, it would not
    be a fit sentence. That was her determination to make. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Indeed, even if we were to find that the trial
    judge erred in principle by relying on the concurrent sentence she imposed as a
    basis for denying C.C. <em>Downes </em>credit, we would not have reduced C.C.’s
    sentence. We agree with the Crown that the crimes he committed were grave and
    that the sentence imposed was required as a fit punishment even after
    considering all mitigating factors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The reasoning we have just expressed is also
    fatal to C.C.’s request to reduce his sentence based on the fresh evidence. The
    sentence C.C. is now seeking would not be fit, even considering the fresh
    evidence he has offered.</span></p>

    C.C.’s rehabilitative potential. The trial judge gave full recognition to
    C.C.’s rehabilitative potential at the time of sentencing and imposed a fit
    sentence with that rehabilitative potential in mind. Although C.C.’s subsequent
    rehabilitative efforts are commendable, they do not reflect the kind of rare post-sentencing
    change in circumstance that could impel this court to reconsider a sentence in
    the absence of judicial error. </span></p>
