    by the United Mexican States (“Mexico”) to set aside an arbitral tribunal’s “Partial
    Award”. Mexico appealed. The moving parties, who were the respondents in the
    application below, move to quash Mexico’s appeal. For the reasons that follow,
    I would quash the appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>investors the right to seek damages for the failure of a party
    (Canada, Mexico, or the United States of America) to honour a treaty commitment.
    The moving parties are thirty-nine USA nationals who brought claims
    individually and on behalf of seven Mexican companies totalling some USD$100
    million to compensate for losses allegedly caused by Mexico’s closure of the
    casinos they had been operating in that country. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The arbitral tribunal was constituted under c.
    11 of NAFTA on February 14, 2017. On April 4, 2017 the tribunal bifurcated the
    proceedings into a jurisdiction phase and a merits and damages phase. The
    jurisdiction phase was heard over five days in May 2018. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A majority of the tribunal determined that the
    tribunal had jurisdiction over all but one of the moving parties’ claims.
    Mexico applied to the Superior Court of Justice to set aside the tribunal’s
    decision under s. 11 of the <em>International Commercial Arbitration Act</em>, <em>2017</em>,
    S.O. 2017, c. 2, Sch. 5 (“ICAA”) and arts. 16 and 34 of the <em>UNCITRAL Model
    Law on International Commercial Arbitration</em>, adopted by the United Nations
    Commission on International Trade Law on June&nbsp;21, 1985, as amended on July
    7, 2006 (the “Model Law”). The Model Law has the force of law in Ontario under
    s. 5 of the ICAA, subject to any modifications set out in the Act. The
    legislation specified that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice is the court
    with jurisdiction to review the decision of the arbitral tribunal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge dismissed the application,
    holding that Mexico had “not discharged its burden of proof of establishing
    that the Tribunal was incorrect in its conclusion that it had jurisdiction over
    all but one of the claims before it”.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue before this panel is whether the
    application judge’s ruling can be appealed to this court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Whether the appeal should be quashed depends
    upon whether Mexico’s application is governed only by art. 16(3) of the Model
    Law, which would prohibit an appeal of the application judge’s decision, or if
    it is also governed by art. 34 of the Model Law, which would permit an appeal. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The focal point of the analysis in this case is
    art. 16 of the Model Law. Article&nbsp;16(1) gives arbitral tribunals the competence
    to rule on their own jurisdiction, as the tribunal did in this case. Article
    16(2) specifies when a party must raise a “plea that the arbitral tribunal does
    not have jurisdiction”. Article 16(3) specifies how the tribunal may proceed
    when its jurisdiction is challenged. It also gives a role to the Ontario
    Superior Court of Justice and prohibits certain appeals. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The text of art. 16(3) makes a clear distinction
    between a jurisdictional plea that is pursued “as a preliminary question” and a
    jurisdictional plea that is pursued “in an award on the merits”. Article 16(3)
    provides:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(3) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea
    referred to in paragraph (2) of this article <span class=Underline>either as a
    preliminary question or in an award on the merits</span>. <span
class=Underline>If</span> the arbitral tribunal rules as a <span
class=Underline>preliminary question</span> that it has jurisdiction, any party
    may request, within thirty days after having received notice of that ruling, [the
    Ontario Superior Court of Justice] to decide the matter, <span class=Underline>which
    decision shall be subject to no appeal</span>; while such a request is pending,
    the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.
    [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The text of art. 16(3) requires this court to
    consider whether the tribunal’s ruling was on a “preliminary question” of
    jurisdiction. If it was, then the application judge’s ruling cannot be appealed
    to this court; in the language of art. 16(3), the application judge’s ruling is
    “subject to no appeal”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By contrast, art. 34 of the Model Law also provides
    for a right of “[r]ecourse to a court against an <span class=Underline>arbitral
    award</span>” (emphasis added), but this language arguably contemplates only the
    recourses available against an award on the merits rather than on a preliminary
    question of jurisdiction. In an application under art. 34, the Model Law places
    no limits on the parties’ ability to appeal from the decision of the Superior
    Court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, I conclude that the arbitral
    tribunal’s ruling was on a “preliminary question” of jurisdiction under art. 16(3)
    so that a further appeal does not lie to this court. I reach this conclusion
    for four reasons. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The arbitral tribunal’s view of what it was
    doing</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the arbitral tribunal saw itself as
    addressing jurisdiction as a preliminary question. In its Partial Award, dated
    July 19, 2019 the tribunal noted that “from 21 May 2018 to 25 May 2018, the
    Tribunal held a <span class=Underline>hearing on jurisdiction</span> in
    Washington, D.C.” (emphasis added): at para. 22. The tribunal specified: “In
    this <span class=Underline>first phase</span> the Tribunal shall decide … <span
class=Underline>three preliminary issues</span>” (emphasis added): at para. 41.
    Based on its interpretation of various provisions of NAFTA, the tribunal dismissed
    most of Mexico’s objections, decided that it had jurisdiction over certain
    claims and, in its final paragraph: “directs the Parties to confer regarding a
    procedural timetable for <span class=Underline>the merits phase</span>…”
    (emphasis added): at para. 273.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The arbitral tribunal has embarked on the merits
    phase</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the arbitral tribunal’s decision did not
    address the substantive merits of the dispute, and the merits phase of the
    dispute is now proceeding despite Mexico’s effort to appeal the application
    judge’s ruling. As noted, this sequence of proceedings is contemplated and
    expressly permitted by art. 16(3): “while such a request [to the Superior
    Court] is pending, the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings
    and make an award”.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The argument before the application judge did
    not address art. 34 of the Model Law </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, Mexico did not focus on art. 34 in its
    application to the Superior Court. Mexico cited art. 34 only in the title of its
    notice of application, and in the introductory paragraph of its factum. Its
    factum contained only two other references to art. 34:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>23. The application to set aside the Partial
    Award is governed by Article 34 of the <em>Model Law</em>. Article 34(2)(a)
    provides that an arbitral award may be set aside if “the award deals with a
    dispute […] not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration” or
    if “the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not
    in accordance with the agreement of the parties”. (Citing Model Law, Art.
    34(2)(a)(iii) and (iv).)</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>76. The failure to comply with Articles 1119
    and 1121 meant that Mexico’s consent to arbitration was not engaged, and the
    Tribunal was deprived of jurisdiction. The Partial Award holding the contrary
    must therefore be set aside, in whole or in part, pursuant to Article 34(2)(a)(iii)
    and (iv) of the <em>Model Law</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is difficult to reconcile these positions
    with Mexico’s statement at para. 22 of its factum before the application judge
    that: “The Partial Award, <span class=Underline>issued pursuant to Article
    16(2) of the Model Law</span>, is a final decision by the Tribunal in respect
    of its jurisdiction” (emphasis added). As noted above, a “final” decision on
    jurisdiction may still be dealt with as a “preliminary question” within the
    meaning of art. 16.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, Mexico’s counsel did not address the
    substance of art. 34 in oral argument before the application judge. The context
    was set in oral argument before the application judge by counsel for the NAFTA
    claimants, who are the moving parties before this court. Counsel focused on s.
    11(1) of the ICAA and on art. 16 and steered the application judge away from
    art. 34. He said, speaking for himself and counsel for Mexico: “<span
class=Underline>[W]e agree … that there is no appeal from your decision in this
    case</span>. And this – that’s an unusual circumstance obviously” (emphasis
    added). Counsel then provided an explanation to the application judge:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]here are two ways in which – in which a
    party under the <em>International Commercial Arbitration Act</em> here in
    Ontario can bring forward an application to this court to set aside a decision.
    One way is the Article 34 route, this is article 34 of the Model Law. And you
    can bring forward a decision and <span class=Underline>quite often that’s done
    in a case where the Tribunal has reached a final award</span>, and you’re
    seeking to set aside that for exceeding jurisdiction or some other issue.
    Sometimes that can be done also if there is a jurisdictional award. Under that

    reference to art. 34. At the outset he noted that this was an application under
    s. 11(1) of the ICAA, and arts. 16 and&nbsp;34 of the Model Law. However, most
    of his oral submissions focused on s.&nbsp;11(1) of the ICAA and art. 16 of the
    Model Law, not art. 34. The references to art. 34 came only in his reading of lengthy
    quotations from this court’s decision in <em>United Mexican States v. Cargill,

    the admissibility of fresh evidence in an application under art. 16 of the
    Model Law. Penny J. cited art. 34 in his discussion of the standard of review
    set out in <em>Cargill</em>. Although he referred incidentally to both arts. 16

    merits of the dispute that gave the claimant <em>Cargill</em> damages against
    Mexico for protectionist measures it enacted in favour of its sugar industry. During
    the proceedings, an objection was raised as to whether the tribunal could award
    upstream damages for losses <em>Cargill</em> suffered in the United States as
    well as downstream losses it suffered in Mexico. Mexico framed this as a
    question of the tribunal’s jurisdiction. In its final award, however, the
    tribunal ruled that the damages issue was not a jurisdictional question and
    that NAFTA permitted <em>Cargill</em> to recover upstream losses. Mexico
    applied to the Superior Court to “decide the matter” and set aside the award. </span></p>

    the tribunal’s ruling was not on a preliminary question but an award on the
    merits, the art. 16(3) prohibition on an appeal from the Superior Court’s ruling
    did not apply. Mexico appealed the Superior Court’s ruling to this court, as it
    was entitled to do. This court dismissed the appeal in a decision that largely
    focussed on the interpretation of art. 34 and, as noted, set the standard of
    review.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The <em>ICAA</em> applies because ICSID chose
    the City of Toronto as the seat of the arbitration. Section 11(1) of the <em>ICAA</em> provides that where the majority of the arbitration tribunal determines it has

    arguability under art.&nbsp;34 in the event that the application did not go
    well for it. Regardless, it is clear that there was no substantive argument on
    how art. 34 applied on the facts of this case before the application judge. Mexico’s

    from the decision of an application judge under art. 16 and that there is a right
    of appeal from the decision of an application judge under art. 34. I would
    agree but on a more nuanced basis. The text of art. 16(3) prohibits an appeal
    from the ruling of a Superior Court judge on the correctness of an arbitral tribunal’s
    ruling on a jurisdictional plea that is pursued “as a preliminary question”. The
    text of art. 34(1) provides that a party may seek “[r]ecourse to a court against
    an arbitral award only by an application for setting aside,” where the tribunal’s
    ruling on a jurisdictional plea was contained “in an award on the merits”, in
    the words of art. 16(3). </span></p>

    ruling of an arbitral tribunal, in other words, to “ride both horses”, which
    was the metaphor put to counsel and adopted by them in argument. However, I
    would observe that the position that an appeal is prohibited where a ruling is
    pursued “as a preliminary question” under art.&nbsp;16(3) has the benefits of
    clarity, simplicity and expediency for which international commercial
    arbitration is touted. </span></p>

    argument by parties committed to opposite perspectives in the court below. Mexico
    argues that it proceeded under both articles before the application judge but,

    before the application judge nor her decision turned on art. 34. Accordingly, I
    would give effect to the language in art. 16(3) of the Model Law that prohibits
    an appeal from the ruling of the application judge on the arbitral tribunal’s
    ruling on a preliminary question of jurisdiction.</span></p>
