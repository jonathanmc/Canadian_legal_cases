    oral and injectable: 2019 CanLII 92439. B.L. appealed the Boards decision to

    appeals to this court.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss the

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>II.       THE APPELLANTS CONDITION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>B.L. is 37 years old. He has been diagnosed with
    schizophrenia. That diagnosis is not in dispute on this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2013, B.L. was admitted to the Ontario Shores
    Centre for Mental Health Sciences (Ontario Shores) under the jurisdiction of
    the Ontario Review Board after being found not criminally responsible for
    striking his father with a cricket bat. He remained at Ontario Shores until
    January 2017, when he was discharged to a group home. After a deterioration in
    his condition following a change in medication, B.L. was re-admitted to Ontario
    Shores in May 2017, where he remains today.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Twice in 2013 B.L. was found incapable of
    consenting to treatment with antipsychotic medication; both times the Board set
    aside the finding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent psychiatrist, Dr. Pytyck, has treated
    B.L. since 2015. At the August 2019 CCB hearing, Dr. Pytyck testified that B.L.
    is extremely high functioning when properly treated, but his condition
    deteriorates quickly without adequate antipsychotic medication. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>From January 2017 to August 2018, B.L. changed the
    dose and type of his medication multiple times after discussing side effects
    and other concerns with Dr. Pytyck. B.L. has not taken any antipsychotic
    medication since August 2018.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Prior to the August 2019 Board hearing, B.L. had
    not taken prescribed medication for about one year. According to Dr. Pytyck, during
    that time B.L.s condition had deteriorated markedly: he exhibited social
    withdrawal, odd interpersonal behaviours, extreme sensitivity to light and
    sound, signs of paranoia, irritability, and disorganization of thought. In the
    month before the Board hearing, Dr. Pytyck noted a dramatic deterioration in
    B.L., including the emergence of delusional beliefs.</span><a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></span></a><span
lang=EN-CA> In her opinion, as of the time of the hearing, B.L. was quite
    overtly psychotic.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal judge, at para. 20 of his reasons,
    summarized B.L.s testimony before the Board as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In his testimony, [B.L.] presented as
    described by [Dr. Pytyck]: intelligent, focused on the legal test of capacity
    and in particular, with demonstrating that he had gone through the process of
    weighing risks and benefits of taking antipsychotic medication. He also
    testified in manner that corroborated [Dr. Pytycks] description of him as
    delusional. He believes that he is suffering because of UV rays, gamma rays,
    and lack of oxygen, and that his somatic complaints are real. He attributes
    these complaints to phenomenon such as climate change, and he believes that his
    antipsychotic medication makes these things worse. At most, in his view, the
    anti-psychotic medication masks the reality of these afflictions, leading him
    to fail to take steps to protect himself, thus afflicting him further.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the Board hearing, Dr. Pytyck testified that for
    many years B.L. had conflated his somatic preoccupations with the side effects
    from his antipsychotic medication. In 2013 and 2014, when he was taking very
    low doses of antipsychotic medication, B.L. reported very high levels of
    somatic side effects. When adequately medicated, B.L. did not complain to the
    same degree. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On his part, B.L. denies that his somatic
    complaints are related to his mental illness. He denies that his medication can
    relieve him from his delusional suffering. Subjectively, he believes that he
    does suffer from physical complaints, that these complaints are worsened by his
    antipsychotic medication, but that one effect of the medication is to dull him
    mentally, so that he forgets about his complaints and then fails to protect
    himself against the negative effects of climate change.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>III.      THE DECISION OF THE BOARD</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 4(1) of the <em>Health Care Consent Act,
    1996</em>, S.O. 1996, c. 2, Sched. A (the Act), establishes a two-branch test
    for determining a persons capacity to consent to treatment. A person is
    capable with respect to a treatment if the person is able to:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Understand the information that is relevant to
    making a decision about the treatment; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Appreciate the reasonably foreseeable
    consequences of a decision or lack of decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before the Board, there was no dispute that B.L.
    satisfied the first branch of the test. The issue was whether B.L. was able to
    appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of
    decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Board acknowledged the proper approach to apply
    to the issue of B.L.s capacity to consent to treatment, stating, at pp. 12-13
    of its reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In assessing the evidence and submissions of
    counsel, I was mindful of the court's caution, in <em>Starson v. Swayze</em> [2003]
    1 S.C.C. 722, that it is not the Board's function to interfere with a capable
    person's rational choices, however foolish. Capable people have the right to
    take risks and make decisions that may be considered unreasonable. The test is
    not whether the choice by the patient appears reasonable or wise, but whether
    the patient is capable of consenting, within the meaning of the statute.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Further, in <em>Starson</em>, the court cautioned
    that the Board must avoid the error of equating the presence of a mental
    disorder with incapacity. People suffering from mental disorders are vulnerable
    to interference with their personal autonomy and are at risk of having their
    decisions regarding treatment not being taken seriously.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA style='text-decoration:
none'></span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>Although a person need
    not agree with the doctor's diagnosis, nor even agree that he or she suffers
    from a mental condition, in order to be found capable, if it is demonstrated
    that he or she has a mental condition, the person must also be able to recognize
    the possibility that he or she is affected by that condition. In that regard,
    it was said in </span></span><span class=EmphasisUnderlineChar><span
lang=EN-CA>Starson</span></span><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA> that if
    the patient's condition results in him being unable to recognize that he is
    affected by its manifestations, he will be unable to apply the relevant
    information to his circumstances, and unable to appreciate the consequences of
    his decision</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In confirming Dr. Pytycks finding that B.L. was
    not capable of consenting to treatment, the Board made several key findings,
    including:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the time of the hearing, B.L. suffered from a
    mental illness, namely schizophrenia: at pp. 7-8;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>B.L. had been more than amply educated about
    his illness and the benefits and risks of medications: at p. 8;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although B.L. was able to acknowledge that he
    had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, he was unable to appreciate that he was
    experiencing paranoia and delusions and that his symptoms were likely those of
    a psychotic illness: at pp. 13-14;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>B.L. lacked the ability to appreciate that he
    was affected by symptoms of mental illness or, at a minimum, was unable to
    appreciate the extent to which his symptomatology governed his behaviour: at p.
    14; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>B.L.'s paranoid delusions about UV rays, gamma
    rays, and carbon dioxide levels interfered with his ability to evaluate how the

    that a patient must be able to appreciate the objectively reasonable material
    risks and benefits of medication before that patient can perform a meaningful

    second branch of the capacity test in s. 4(1) of the Act to the facts of his

    the parameters of his treatment decision because he is cognizant of: the nature
    and purpose of the proposed treatment; the foreseeable benefits and risks of
    the treatment; the alternative courses of action; and the expected consequences

    the World Health Organization (WHO) on various environmental issues. Dr.
    Pytyck objects to the inclusion of the articles on the grounds that: (i) they were
    not before the Board or the appeal judge; (ii) they are not relevant to a decisive

    if the appeal court applied the standard properly. In so doing, this court
    steps into the shoes of the Superior Court of Justice and focuses on the
    tribunals decision under review:<em> Agraira v. Canada (Minister of Public
    Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</em>, 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, at

    of mixed fact and law, reviewable on the deferential standard of palpable and
    overriding error, absent an extricable question of law in the Boards analysis: <em>Starson</em> <em>v. Swayze</em>, 2003 SCC 32, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 722, at para.

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>VII.    ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I understand B.L.s position on this appeal,
    he submits that the Board erred in law by applying the wrong legal standard to
    its assessment of the evidence and, as well, that the Boards findings were
    based on a misapprehension of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The alleged error of law</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal judge recorded, at para. 5, that B.L.
    had conceded the Board had applied the correct legal test when assessing his
    capacity to consent to treatment. However, on this appeal B.L.s counsel
    submits that the Board and appeal judge in fact applied the wrong legal test.
    As I understand the submission, B.L. argues that the Board incorrectly applied
    an objective standard of reasonableness, or a kind of best interests test,
    when assessing B.L.s ability to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable
    consequences of a decision to take or refuse medication, instead of determining
    the issue based solely on B.L.s subjective appreciation of the consequences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I see no such error by the Board. With respect,
    B.L.s submissions overlook an important element of the legal test as
    articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Starson</em>. As the Board pointed out
    in its reasons, at p. 13, in <em>Starson</em> the Supreme Court stated, at
    para. 79:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>While a patient need not agree with a
    particular diagnosis, if it is demonstrated that he has a mental condition,
    the patient must be able to recognize the possibility that he is affected by
    that condition. Professor Weisstub comments on this requirement as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>Condition refers to the broader
    manifestations of the illness rather than the existence of a discrete
    diagnosable pathology. The word condition allows the requirement for
    understanding to focus on the objectively discernible manifestations of the
    illness rather than the interpretation that is made of these manifestations.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As a result, a patient is not required to
    describe his mental condition as an illness, or to otherwise characterize the
    condition in negative terms. <span class=Underline>Nor is a patient required to
    agree with the attending physicians opinion regarding the cause of that
    condition. Nonetheless, if the patients condition results in him being unable
    to recognize that he is affected by its manifestations, he will be unable to
    apply the relevant information to his circumstances, and unable to appreciate
    the consequences of his decision</span>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the <em>Starson</em> test for
    capacity in respect of the ability to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable
    consequences of a decision or lack of decision includes a requirement to
    consider whether a persons condition results in an inability to recognize that
    he or she is affected by its manifestations, thereby rendering the person unable
    to apply the relevant information and appreciate the consequences of his or her
    decision. This aspect of the legal test has been repeated and applied by this
    court in several cases: <em>Giecewicz v. Hastings</em>, 2007 ONCA 890, 288
    D.L.R. (4th) 587, at paras. 18-21, leave to appeal refused, [2008] S.C.C.A. No.

    reasonably foreseeable consequences of a treatment decision in light of his
    mental illness, his capacity to understand the symptoms and effects of his
    mental illness, the benefits of medical treatment in B.L.s specific
