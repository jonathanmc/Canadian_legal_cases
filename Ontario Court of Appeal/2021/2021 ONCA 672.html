    conference with her close friend and supporter, Joan Wakeling, and notified opposing
    counsel that Ms. Wakeling would be a witness at the upcoming hearing. Ms.
    Evison was appealing her insurer’s decision to deny her accident benefits
    following a car accident. Her insurer, Desjardins General Insurance Group Inc.,
    had employed Ms. Wakeling for many years. When Desjardins management learned of
    Ms. Wakeling’s participation in the conference, they fired her. Both Ms.
    Wakeling and Ms. Evison brought an action in the Ontario Superior Court,
    arguing (among other things) that Desjardins and its counsel, Nadia
    Constantino, had invaded their privacy by revealing to Desjardins management
    that Wakeling had participated in the conference. Wakeling also argued that she
    had been wrongfully terminated. Justice Healey struck all their claims except
    Wakeling’s claims for wrongful termination and for aggravated and punitive
    damages against Desjardins.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW OF THE APPEAL</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants argue that Justice Healey erred
    by: (1) striking their claim for breach of privacy (intrusion upon seclusion)
    without leave to amend; (2) dismissing their entire action against the
    respondent Nadia Constantino without leave to amend; (3) striking certain of their
    claims for punitive damages; and (4) not permitting them to amend their claim
    to add new defendants and new causes of action. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Evison was involved in a car accident in
    2018. Her claim for accident benefits was denied by her insurer, Desjardins
    General Insurance Group Inc. Ms. Evison appealed the denial to the License
    Appeal Tribunal (the “LAT”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A case conference was scheduled before the
    tribunal. Ms. Evison brought her long-time friend and neighbour, Ms. Wakeling,
    to assist her at the conference. Ms. Evison recorded Wakeling’s name on her
    witness list and gave the list to Desjardins’ counsel at the hearing, Nadia Constantino.
    Ms. Wakeling had been an employee of Desjardins and its predecessor companies
    for 24 years. At the conference, Ms. Evison asked Ms. Constantino if there
    would be any consequences for Ms. Wakeling’s employment with Desjardins. Ms. Constantino
    declined to answer, and Ms. Wakeling then left the conference. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On her first day back at work following the case
    conference, Ms. Wakeling was told that Desjardins was investigating her
    conduct, and she was escorted out of the building. Eleven business days later
    she was fired, because of her involvement in Evison’s accident benefits claim </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>and alleged failure to comply with a
    company code of conduct</span><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:200%'>.</span><span lang=EN-CA> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Wakeling and Evison brought claims against
    Desjardins and Constantino in the Superior Court of Justice for breach of
    privacy and punitive damages. The appellants pleaded that they had an
    expectation of privacy, which the respondents breached when Evison’s witness
    list (containing Wakeling’s name) was revealed to Desjardins management. Wakeling
    alone brought claims against Desjardins for wrongful termination and for
    aggravated and punitive damages. These claims are not at issue in this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Wakeling and Evison filed a motion in the
    Ontario Superior Court of Justice to add to their Statement of Claim additional
    defendants (all employees of Desjardins in their personal capacities) and
    additional claims for breach of privacy, breach of confidence, and breach of
    the <em>Human Rights Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.O.
    1990, c.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;19</span></em>. Desjardins and Constantino simultaneously
    brought a motion to strike all claims related to breach of privacy, and to
    strike any residual claims against Constantino in her personal capacity. They
    also sought to block Wakeling and Evison from adding the new claims and new
    defendants.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge’s decision</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge struck the appellants’ claims
    for breach of privacy and punitive damages. She dismissed the entire action
    against Nadia Constantino and denied the appellants leave to add new claims and

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge noted that a pleading should be
    struck if it plainly and obviously discloses no reasonable cause of action,
    assuming all the facts pleaded to be true: <em>Potis Holdings Ltd. v. The Law
    Society of Upper Canada</em>, </span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>2019

lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>She also set out the test for the tort of
    intrusion upon seclusion (breach of privacy): (1) intentional conduct by the
    defendant; (2) an invasion, without lawful justification, of the plaintiff’s
    private affairs or concerns; and (3) an invasion that would be regarded by a
    reasonable person as highly offensive causing distress, humiliation, or
    anguish: <em>Jones v. Tsige</em>, </span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:
200%'>2012 ONCA 32, 108 O.R. (3d) 241,</span><span lang=EN-CA> at paras. 71-72.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge found that a breach of privacy
    could not be made out on the facts pleaded. The respondents’ conduct was not
    intentional, because the respondents never compelled or caused Wakeling to
    appear at the conference and never compelled or caused Evison to turn over the
    witness list with Wakeling’s name on it. The respondents did not invade the plaintiffs’
    private affairs; they passively received information from the appellants. They
    were lawfully entitled to receive a witness list from Evison in the context of the
    LAT proceeding. The appellants did not plead any facts to support the third
    prong of the <em>Jones</em> test; but in any case, the motion judge found that
    a reasonable person would never consider the alleged intrusion to be highly
    offensive. The decision to disseminate the witness list to Desjardins
    management could not be considered an intrusion, because breach of privacy is
    not concerned with the dissemination of information: <em>Jones </em>at para.
    57.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge gave alternative bases for
    striking the claim for breach of privacy, including that the claim was legally
    untenable and therefore an abuse of process because it would have required an
    impermissible incursion into privileged communications between Constantino and
    Desjardins.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Punitive Damages</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge struck the punitive damages
    claims because they were based on the struck breach of privacy claims. She
    noted that claims for punitive damages could not stand on their own: <em>Ferme
    Gérald Laplante &amp; Fils Ltée v. Grenville Patron Mutual Fire Insurance Co</em>.
    (2002), </span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>61 O.R. (3d) 481 (Ont.
    C.A.)</span><span lang=EN-CA>, leave to appeal refused, [2002] S.C.C.A. No.
    488, at para. 113. She noted several alternative bases for striking the
    punitive damages claims. Constantino’s conduct occurred within the course of
    her employment with Desjardins and could not give rise to personal liability.
    Constantino’s communication of the witness list to her client, Desjardins, was
    privileged. The communication also arose in the context of a quasi-judicial
    proceeding and was therefore protected by absolute immunity.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Other Claims Against Constantino</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The remaining claims against Constantino were
    predicated on a theory that Constantino was under a duty to protect the
    appellants and breached that duty by revealing the witness list to her client.
    The motion judge rejected this theory, because a party’s solicitor owes no duty
    of care to the other party: <em>Davy Estate v. CIBC World Markets Inc</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em>, </span><span lang=EN-CA

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge did not grant leave for the
    appellants to add more parties and claims to their Statement of Claim. She
    denied leave to add more breach of privacy claims for substantially the reasons
    above. She denied leave to add more Desjardins employees in their personal
    capacities for substantially the same reasons that had led her to dismiss the
    claims against Constantino.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>She also denied leave for two new claims: breach
    of confidence and breach of the <em>Human Rights Code</em>. She found that a
    reasonable person would not expect the fact of Wakeling’s attendance at the
    case conference to have the quality of confidentiality required by <em>Lac
    Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources Ltd.</em>, </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[1989] 2 S.C.R. 574</span><span lang=EN-CA>.
    She found that the <em>Human Rights Code</em> claim had no possibility of
    success because it could not possibly relate to one of the particular social
    areas targeted by the Code (services, accommodation of minors, contracts,
    employment, and vocational associations).</span></p>

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The receipt of the information </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The tort of intrusion upon seclusion protects
    private information from unauthorized prying eyes. It is plain and obvious that
    Ms. Wakeling’s attendance in person at a case conference in an adjudicative
    proceeding before an administrative tribunal was not a private event. Further,
    Ms. Constantino’s receipt of information consisting of a witness list provided
    by Ms. Evison did not amount to an intrusion; it was authorized by Ms. Evison
    herself, and it was not private information. Moreover, the appellants pleaded
    in para. 11 of their statement of claim that tribunal disclosure requirements
    mandate that witness lists be exchanged in advance of the case conference. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On this basis it is plain and obvious that no

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, as a party to the proceeding, Desjardins
    was entitled to the information and Ms. Constantino owed a duty to her client
    to report the unfolding of the case conference to Desjardins. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is plain and obvious that there was no cause
    of action against Ms. Constantino for intrusion upon seclusion, for either her
    receipt of the information or her transmission of the information to her
    employer. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Claims for other breaches of duty by Ms.
    Constantino</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The statement of claim pleads in diverse
    respects variations on a theme that Desjardins’ counsel owed a duty to the
    appellants, and in some cases is premised on a duty said to exist after the
    case conference and after the report to Desjardins. For example, the appellants
    pleaded that counsel breached her obligations to the administration of justice
    when she failed to counsel her client on the impropriety of terminating Ms.
    Wakeling’s employment and failed to recognize she had a conflict of interest
    when she later learned that her employer had acted on the information provided. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the motion judge correctly noted, Ms.
    Constantino’s duty was to her employer, Desjardins, for whom she was acting as
    counsel. She did not owe a duty of care to the appellant.</span></p>

    seclusion</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the same reasons, the receipt by Desjardins
    from its counsel of information, provided to that counsel by the appellant
    Evison, does not amount to an intrusion upon Ms. Evison’s privacy interests. Ms.
    Evison provided the information to Desjardins’ counsel in the course of
    attendance before an administrative tribunal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The use Desjardins made of that information and
    the termination of Ms. Wakeling’s employment will be addressed in the latter’s
    claim for damages for wrongful dismissal, a proceeding that is continuing.
    Desjardins does not challenge the pleadings in relation to the claims for
    wrongful dismissal. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Claim for punitive damages</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Desjardins takes no issue with respect to Ms.
    Wakeling’s claim for punitive damages related to termination of her employment.
    The statement of claim also included claims for punitive damages by Ms. Evison
    against Desjardins, and by both appellants against Ms. Constantino. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The claim for punitive damages is not a
    free-standing cause of action. It must be tied to an independent actionable
    wrong. The plaintiffs alleged that the manner in which the defendants breached
    Evison’s privacy interests was so egregious and high-handed that punitive
    damages are appropriate to further sanction the wrongs committed. If the
    statement of claim does not disclose a reasonable cause of action for intrusion
    upon seclusion then the claim for punitive damages for that wrong must also
    fall. On appeal the appellants attempt to characterize the wrong supporting the
    claim for punitive damages as a breach of the contractual duty of good faith. It
    is plain that receipt of the information provided by Ms. Evison by counsel and
    Desjardins could not amount to a breach of a contractual duty of good faith. I
    discuss Desjardins’ use of the information at paras. 41 and following in these
    reasons.</span></p>

    claim proposed to add four defendants: Risha Maharaj, Joe Crngarov, Tara
    Davidson, and Jacqueline Thompson. It appears that the first two named were
    adjusters who also attended the conference before the LAT. The proposed amended
    statement of claim alleges that Ms. Evison had an expectation that “individuals
    providing her assistance and/or her potential witness would be held in
    confidence by the lawyer, Ms. Constantino, adjusters Risha Maharaj and Joe
    Crngarov and the information would not be disclosed and/or used in any manner
    outside the proceeding.” The statement of claim alleges that the four named
    individuals had access to and/or misused the plaintiff’s personal information
    to harass and eventually improperly terminate Ms. Wakeling’s employment. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The access to the information at the case
    conference cannot amount to an intrusion upon seclusion for reasons already

    court proceeding when ancillary to another valid claim. Under those
    circumstances a court may direct the infringing party to pay monetary
    compensation to the party whose right was infringed. The appellant concedes
    that without another valid claim there can be no claim based only on a breach
    of the <em>Human Rights Code</em>. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Although a person
    may not commence an action based solely on an infringement of a right under
    Part I of the Code, breach of the Code may be properly raised in an action if
    the claim is otherwise properly before the court. Thus, whether or not a claim
    for breach of the duty to accommodate disabilities can proceed in the Superior
    Court depends upon whether or not the pleading discloses a reasonable cause of
    action that does not arise solely from a breach of the Code.</span></p>

    was discriminatory. Ms. Evison also does not claim that she was subjected to
    adverse treatment because of her disability. As the motion judge pointed out,
    “such a connection is absent both within the pleading and on the facts of this
    case. There is no connection made between Evison’s disability and Constantino’s
    response to Wakeling. In fact, the proposed amendments do not outline how the
    defendants are alleged to have subjected Evison to adverse treatment, or to
    have done so as a result of her disability, by Constantino’s inability to
    provide Wakeling with employment assurances.” </span></p>
