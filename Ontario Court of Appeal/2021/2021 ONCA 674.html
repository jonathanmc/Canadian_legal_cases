  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Trotter J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants were involved in a large-scale cannabis
    grow operation located at Mr. Fan’s farm. Mr. Fan leased greenhouses on his
    farm to a third party to produce the cannabis; Mr. Ling acted as a “gardener”
    for the cannabis plants. The police executed a search warrant at the farm and
    seized 1,025 plants; the harvested marihuana would have been worth between $6.6
    to $15.375 million.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although there were multiple Health Canada licences
    on-site that authorized cannabis production, neither appellant was a named
    licence-holder and none of the licences designated the farm as an authorized
    production or storage site. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants were convicted of the following
    offences under the <em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c.
    19 (“<em>CDSA</em>”): possession of marihuana (s. 4(1)), possession of
    marihuana for the purposes of trafficking (s. 5(2)), and production of marihuana
    (s. 7(1)). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants asserted a defence of honest but
    mistaken belief that the grow operation was properly licenced. They relied on
    the licences, notarized statutory declarations that purported to transfer the
    licences to the farm property, and assurances from third parties (none of whom
    were lawyers or state officials) that the documents were legitimate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that, even if the
    appellants were truly mistaken about the legality of their operation, it was a
    mistake of law, not a mistake of fact. She found the appellants guilty and sentenced
    Mr. Fan to imprisonment for 20 months, and Mr. Ling for 15 months. The appellants
    appeal their convictions and sentences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would dismiss the conviction appeal because
    the trial judge did not accept the appellants’ evidence that they believed the
    grow operation was legal. I also agree with her conclusion that, if the appellants’
    accounts were believable, they were labouring under a mistake of law, which is not
    a valid defence. I would uphold the sentences as fit.</span></p>

    immigrated to Canada as adults. Neither speaks, writes, or reads English. They
    both testified at trial with the assistance of an interpreter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Fan purchased the 100-acre farm property in
    2013, the year after he immigrated to Canada. He built 40 greenhouses on the land.
    He and his business partner, Bin Lin, grew vegetables to sell to Chinese
    supermarkets and restaurants.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Fan testified that, in February 2015, Guanhua
    Li approached him and Mr. Lin about leasing part of the farm to grow cannabis. Mr.
    Li told Mr. Fan that the grow operation would be legal and for personal use. He
    showed Mr. Fan his production licence, which authorized Mr. Li to grow 244 cannabis
    plants and store a set amount of dried cannabis, all indoors. He also told Mr.
    Fan that if Mr. Li’s driver’s licence was registered to the farm property, his
    production licence would follow. At some point, Mr. Li showed Mr. Fan the
    following documents: </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In April 2015, Mr. Fan and Mr. Li executed an
    Agreement to Lease (that may have been backdated to December 31, 2014), which
    permitted Mr. Li to lease part of the farm, at a rate of $3,000/month, for
    “plantation” purposes for one year.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    $3,000 a month in cash. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Police Investigation </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants were arrested in September 2015.
    However, they place significance on an earlier visit the police made to the
    farm.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In July 2015, the police went to the farm
    looking for Mr. Li, who was a potential witness in another investigation. Mr.
    Lin was present and told the police Mr. Li was renting the greenhouses to grow
    medical cannabis. An officer noted the licences on site were expired and began
    a follow-up investigation. He abandoned the investigation in light of a Federal
    Court<i> </i>injunction, discussed below. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police initiated a second investigation in
    September 2015, after a police officer in the area noticed a strong smell of
    fresh cannabis coming from the farm property. Although the outside row of
    greenhouses, which were visible from the road, appeared to be empty, the police
    could see cannabis plants growing through the tops and sides of some of the
    other greenhouses. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police seized 1,025 cannabis plants from 25
    of the 40 greenhouses. Only some of the greenhouses were covered. The residence
    and outbuildings on the property contained various amounts of dried cannabis,
    drying racks, grow lights, ballasts, and cases of freezer bags. There were also
    motion detection sensors and video surveillance cameras covering the
    greenhouses and the entryway to the property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police also seized four licences and four
    corresponding statutory declarations from one of the greenhouse doors (the
    remaining licences and documents were presented at trial). Together, the four
    licences permitted 634 plants to be grown indoors. None of the licence-holders
    were present at the farm, and none of the licences listed the farm address as
    an authorized production or storage site. Health Canada confirmed there were no
    licences issued to Mr. Fan for any address; nor were there licences for the
    farm address under any name.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Fan and Mr. Ling were present at the farm
    when the police conducted the search. Though Mr. Ling initially ran from police
    (he testified that he believed it was a robbery), he stopped and was
    apprehended near the greenhouses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In a report filed on consent, an expert witness opined
    that the value of the seized plants ranged from $6.6 to $15.375 million. The
    plants were larger than typical cannabis plants. The expert witness estimated
    the 1,025 seized plants would yield roughly 5,125 pounds of cannabis. This
    amount of cannabis was consistent with a high-level trafficker and the
    operation was typical of a commercial grow operation. The marihuana was clearly
    not grown for personal use, or for medical purposes.</span></p>

    which authorized licence-holders to produce cannabis, at designated locations,
    for individual medical use. Under the <em>MMAR</em>, anyone with an ATP could
    apply for a licence to produce cannabis, either through a Personal Production
    Licence (“PPL”, under which the PPL-holder could produce cannabis for personal medical
    use only) or a Designated Person Production Licence (“DPL”, under which the
    DPL-holder could produce cannabis on behalf of a PPL-holder, but only for the
    PPL-holder’s personal medical use).</span></p>

    and replace the PPL and DPL system with a “Licenced Producers” scheme using
    production licences. The scheme is broader than the <em>MMAR</em><i> </i>system,
    and more commercially focused. The <em>MMPR</em> permitted licenced producers
    to possess, produce, and sell cannabis at authorized production sites. It also
    allowed licenced producers to designate one or more “responsible person in
    charge”, who would be responsible for supervising the cannabis-related
    activities at the authorized sites. It also allowed licenced producers to hire
    employees, but required a “responsible person in charge” to be present in any

    DPL granted before March 31, 2014, until the court resolved the constitutional

    (Ont. C.A.), in which this court found that the accused’s mistaken belief that
    his employer had a licence to manufacture a controlled substance in the

    the issue turns on the accused persons’ understanding or interpretation of the

    that it was legal to use licences granted to other persons when accompanied by
    either the holder’s statutory declaration to change the production site or a
    driver’s licence changed to the farm property’s address. <u>Mr. Fan and Mr.
    Ling, therefore, fell prey to a mistake of law about whether the documentation
    authorized them to produce marihuana without personally being lawfully authorized

    judge’s conclusion that their misunderstanding was a mistake of law rather than
    a mistake of fact. They say that she mischaracterized the situation. I do not
    agree. But there is a more direct and practical basis upon which this appeal
    should be dismissed – the trial judge simply did not accept the appellants’

    findings. As Feldman J.A. stated in <em>R. v. B.J.T</em><i>.</i>, 2019 ONCA

    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. In her reasons allowing this application,
    the trial judge stated, “I do not accept that either of them had an honest but
    mistaken belief in the legality of the operation” and gave reasons for this
    adverse credibility finding: <em>R. v. Ling</em>, 2017 ONSC 5627, at para. 31.

    356, at p. 362. In this case, the appellants were aware that the production and

    the scope of his licence to possess a firearm under the <em>Firearms Act</em>,

    2014 SCC 3, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 37. In restoring the conviction, the Supreme Court

    licence, “Mr. MacDonald’s subjective belief that he could possess the firearm
    in Halifax is therefore nothing other than a mistake of law.” This principle
    has been applied to licences under the <em>CDSA</em> in <em>R. v. Vu</em>, 2018

    authorization or licence negates the <em>actus reus</em> of activity that would
    otherwise be illegal. Conceived as a <em>mens rea</em><i> </i>component, it
    would require the Crown to prove that an accused person knew the conditions of
    their licence or authorization. As Lamer C.J. held in <em>R. v. Forster</em>,
    [1992] 1 S.C.R. 339, at p. 346: “[K]nowledge that one’s actions are contrary to
    the law is not a component of the <em>mens rea</em> for an offence, and

    Whereas MacDonald was mistaken that his licence permitted him to possess a
    firearm at a certain location, the appellants were wrong in their asserted belief
    that: (a) the licences permitted <em>them</em> to produce and store marihuana;
    (b) the licences permitted production and storage of marihuana <i>at</i> the
    farm property; and (c) the marihuana could be produced outdoors. As in <em>Forster</em>,

    that the appellants “were wilfully blind to the grow operation’s illegality.”
    Applying <em>MacDonald</em><i> </i>and <em>Forster</em>, the concept of wilful
    blindness had no role to play in this analysis. Nonetheless, I am still
    satisfied that she reached the correct conclusion that the appellants were

    from which information about the licences could be obtained.</span></p>

    confirm legality is simply a claim that they did their best, a claim the trial
    judge rejected. Even if accepted, these efforts could not elude the reach of s.

    was) said, at para. </span><span lang=EN-CA>57: “A defendant can therefore gain
    nothing by showing that it made a reasonable effort to know the law or that it
    acted in good faith in ignorance of the law, since such evidence cannot exempt
    it from liability.” Section 19 does not reward effort; it demands correctness.
    Canadian jurisprudence does not recognize the concept of “a reasonable mistake
    of law”.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

    Lamer C.J. said in <em>Jorgensen</em>, at para. 5, is “an orienting principle
    of our criminal law which should not be lightly disturbed.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><u><span lang=EN-CA>Potential Authorization Under the <i>MMPR</i></span></u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants further submit that the enactment
    of the <em>MMPR</em>, which authorizes the commercial production of marihuana, could
    have applied to exempt them from criminal liability. Relying on <em>R. v. Tong</em>,
    [2019] O.J. No. 5710 (S.C.), the appellants contend that the potential legality
    of their conduct, under a different regulatory regime, transformed their
    mistake of law into a mistake of fact.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept the appellants’ submissions. As
    already noted, the issue of whether the <em>MMPR</em> could have authorized the
    appellants’ conduct was not raised at trial. Moreover, even if the <em>MMPR</em> could apply to the appellants’ grow operation, it would not assist the
    appellants because the <em>MMPR</em> required security clearances for
    individuals who are central to commercial operations. Outdoor production was
    not permitted and the appellants are unable to escape the fact that the farm
    was not a designated location for the production or storage of cannabis.
    Moreover, and as the trial judge noted, “[n]either the <em>MMAR</em> nor the <em>MMPR</em> allowed a valid change of production site by statutory declaration.” The
    appellants’ claim essentially dissolves into the untenable assertion that, had
    they obtained different licences, their operation would have been legal. It is
    tantamount to the accused in <em>MacDonald</em><i> </i>submitting that, because
    he may have been able to obtain a licence to possess the firearm in Nova
    Scotia, his mistake about the scope of his existing licence became factual. I
    would reject this line of reasoning.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Finally, the appellants rely on the previous decisions of this court
    in <em>Darquea</em>, <em>R. v. Johnson</em>, 2016 ONCA 654, and <em>R. v.
    Pilgrim</em>, 2017 ONCA 309, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 141. All three cases involved mistakes
    about the <i>existence</i> of licences or authorizations, not about their scope
    or application. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In <em>Darquea</em>, the accused mistakenly believed that the head
    of the laboratory where he worked was licenced to produce the drug in question.
    In <em>Johnson</em>, the accused mistakenly believed that a PPL existed for a
    property when none existed; in <em>Pilgrim</em>, the accused laboured under the<i> </i>mistaken belief that her spouse had a drug prescription under the <em>Narcotic
    Control Regulations</em>, C.R.C., c. 1041, when no such prescription existed. All
    three scenarios amounted to mistakes of fact. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>By contrast, in this case, the appellants were mistaken as to the
    reach of the licences they knew existed and, as such, were mistaken as to the
    applicable law. As this court aptly put it in <em>Vu</em>, at para. 67
    (discussing <em>Johnson</em>), “a mistake as to the terms of one’s license is a
    mistake of law, not a mistake of fact.”</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the offences were committed, Mr. Fan was 54
    years old. He had no criminal record. In a positive Pre-Sentence Report, he was
    a described as hard-working family man. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Ling was 27 at the time of the offences. Like
    Mr. Fan, Mr. Ling had no prior criminal record. In an equally positive
    Pre-Sentence Report, he too was described as a hard worker who supported two
    children from a previous marriage, as well as a step-daughter. When he was
    sentenced, his wife was pregnant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both appellants potentially faced adverse

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge imposed global sentences of 20 and
    15 months on Mr. Fan and Mr. Ling, respectively. While she recognized each
    appellant benefited from several mitigating factors, those had to be weighed
    against the aggravating factors. In particular, the trial judge noted that
    “[cannabis] cultivation often leads to other social evils and risks to public
    safety including violent criminal activity”, especially those in vulnerable
    groups: <em>Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</em><i>)</i>,<i> </i>[1998] 1 S.C.R. 982, at paras. 85-91; <em>R. v. Evans</em>, [1996] 1 S.C.R.
    8, at para. 24; <em>R. v. Malmo-Levine; R. v. Caine</em>, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3
    S.C.R. 571, at paras. 134-37; <em>R. v. Tran</em>, 2005 CanLII 3937, 194 O.A.C.
    278 (C.A.), at para. 5; and <em>R. v. Nguyen</em>, 2007 ONCA 645, 227 C.C.C.
    (3d) 262, at paras. 46-48. In imposing the appellants’ sentences, the trial
    judge also relied on jurisprudence from this court that establishes that
    denunciation and deterrence are paramount considerations in cases involving
    large-scale cannabis grow operations: <em>R. v. Peltier</em>, 2013 ONCA 141,
    303 O.A.C. 87; <em>R. v. Chen</em>, 2007 ONCA 230.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants raise two issues on the sentence
    appeal: the trial judge erred in considering the risk of violence and risk to
    members of vulnerable groups as aggravating factors; and the trial judge misapplied
    the parity principle and consequently imposed disproportionate and demonstrably
    unfit sentences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I accept the appellants’ submissions that the
    legal landscape relating to the production and possession of marihuana has
    changed significantly in recent years; however, this court’s approach to
    large-scale grow operations has not.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>R. v. Strong</em>, 2019 ONCA 15, this
    court said, at para. 4, that it is not the case that “prolonged trafficking for
    profit in marijuana is somehow viewed as less serious because of the
    legislative changes in respect of personal possession and use.” See also <em>R.
    v. Kennedy</em>, 2019 ONCA 77, at para. 11. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Furthermore, contrary to the appellants’
    submissions, it is not the case that the risks to vulnerable groups as detailed
    in earlier jurisprudence has been “debunked” such that the trial judge erred in
    relying on them. As the Crown correctly points out, the current legislative
    scheme governing cannabis use – despite decriminalizing it for those of legal
    age – still incorporates safety rules and warnings geared toward some of the
    very concerns addressed in the jurisprudence on which the trial judge relied:
    see <em>Cannabis Regulations</em>, S.O.R./2018-144, s. 123(1)(d)-(e). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, what happened at the time of arrest in
    this case is very telling. Mr. Ling attempted to escape, apparently fearful
    that he was going to be robbed. He further testified that Mr. Li had told him
    that security cameras were installed around the farm to prevent this kind of
    occurrence. Accordingly, the trial judge’s reliance on this factor was not
    misplaced.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Finally, the sentences were proportionate in
    the circumstances and on par with those imposed in analogous cases: see <em>R.
    v. Bentley</em>, 2017 ONCA 982, at para. 11.<i> </i>The trial judge correctly observed
    that, while neither appellant was the directing mind behind the operation, they
    each played a critical role in the enterprise. The plants seized from the farm
    were larger than typical cannabis plants, and their estimated value ranged
    upwards of $15 million. Considering the size of the potential yield from the farm’s
    plants – roughly 5,125 pounds – it was reasonable for the trial judge to rely
    on cases involving larger grow operations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge properly considered the
    circumstances of the offences and offenders, the applicable mitigating and
    aggravating factors, each appellant’s respective level of the moral
    blameworthiness, and the governing principles and purposes of sentencing. There
    is no basis for this court to interfere: <em>R. v. Lacasse</em>, 2015 SCC 64,
    [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at paras. 38-41.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lastly, the trial judge imposed victim
    surcharges on both appellants. In light of <em>R. v. Boudreault</em>, 2019 SCC
    58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599, and with the consent of the Crown, they are set aside.
    I would otherwise dismiss the sentence appeals.</span></p>

    knowledge is socially desirable; (3) otherwise every person would be a law unto
