  <p class=Onappealfrom><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the convictions entered

  <p align=center style='
text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS
    FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault,
    sexual interference, and invitation to sexual touching, all in relation to his
    granddaughter. The appellant was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. He
    appeals his convictions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The victim was 25 years old at the time of
    trial. She testified about what happened to her between 2000 and 2004, when she
    was 7 to 11 years old. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The victim’s parents were incapable of providing
    a stable environment for her and her siblings. Consequently, the children often
    stayed with the appellant and his wife. By all accounts, aside from the abuse, the
    victim and the appellant shared a good relationship when she was a child. Since
    then, the appellant has provided for her financially.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>But there was another side to their
    relationship. The victim described a number of sexual incidents that occurred
    in the appellant’s home and in his car. The appellant licked the victim’s
    vagina, rubbed his penis outside her vagina, put his penis in her mouth, and
    penetrated her vagina. These incidents stopped when the victim started
    menstruating at age 11 or 12.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The victim said that she came forward with her
    allegations because: (a) she was aware of an incident where the appellant
    propositioned and then sexually assaulted her brother’s former girlfriend; and
    (b) she was concerned that the appellant might be abusing her younger sister.
    The victim went to the Children’s Aid Society, hoping it would result in her
    sister being removed from the appellant’s home. The matter was referred to the
    police. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified and denied the
    allegations. He said that the victim was very upset with him a week before she
    made the allegations because he had refused to lend her money to purchase a new
    car. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In thorough reasons for judgment, the trial
    judge rejected the appellant’s evidence. She was satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the appellant sexually abused the victim in the manner that she
    described. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in how she addressed the question of whether the victim had a motive to
    fabricate the allegations, thereby requiring a new trial. We disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The car loan motive was put in play by the
    appellant. The appellant and the victim agreed that the appellant told her that,
    if she could pay all of her own bills at her new accommodation, he would help
    her buy a new car the following year. Their evidence, however, diverged as to
    her reaction. The victim testified that the proposal made sense, was logical
    and that she was fine with it. The appellant said the victim was “pissed” and
    walked away from him. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    evidence on this issue. She said: “While the defendant is under no obligation
    to explain why the complainant would fabricate the allegations, the manner in
    which he described the complainant’s reaction to his refusal of her request for
    a loan appeared to me to be an effort to manufacture a motive for the
    complainant to lie.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also rejected the appellant’s
    account of how he reacted upon hearing that the victim was pregnant when she
    was 18. She said it was their “biggest argument” and she moved out and went to
    live with her mother for a while. The appellant said he was happy to hear the
    news and was welcoming of the child. The trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    account concluding it was “an effort on his part to portray himself in a
    favourable light.” In combination with his evidence on the car loan, the trial
    judge rejected the appellant’s testimony denying the allegations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also addressed the issue of
    motive when considering the victim’s evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant was an impressive witness. She
    presented as forthright, and careful not to guess about things she did not
    remember. She was clear and articulate. She frankly acknowledged when she could
    not remember or did not know the answer to a question. Apart from the
    allegations and a few other things, her evidence was substantially corroborated
    by the evidence of the defendant, which confirms that she can reliably describe
    her circumstances as a child. She presented in the same thoughtful and
    deliberate manner in cross-examination as she did in her evidence in-chief. <u>She
    did not appear to hold any grudge against the defendant, and readily
    acknowledged all the good things he did for her. I find that it has been proven
    that she had no motive to lie. The evidence establishes that she knew that if
    she came forward her family, and in particular her children, would suffer as a
    result</u>…<u>For the most part, she kept her emotions in check when she
    testified, but could not hide her sadness when she talked about her loss of her
    relationship with her grandmother, and the support she received from her
    grandparents when things get rough for her. She seemed more upset by that than
    by what her grandfather did to her, which makes sense, given her circumstances,
    and the fact that she maintained a good relationship with him as a teenager and
    young adult.</u> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in finding that there was a proven lack of motive, and by using this finding to
    bolster her credibility. Relatedly, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred in relying on the negative consequences to the victim as a result of
    making the allegations as an indication that she had no motive to fabricate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We are not troubled by the manner in which the
    trial judge resolved the car loan issue. The appellant introduced this issue at
    trial. There was nothing inappropriate in doing so, but the trial judge, in
    turn, was required to address the issue. On her evaluation of the evidence, she
    found that it was not a viable motive. It was open to the trial judge to make
    this finding on the record before her. In doing so, she instructed herself that
    the appellant had no onus to prove a motive. Her finding is entitled to
    deference: <em>R. v. Barton</em>, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para.
    132.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It would have been sufficient had the trial
    judge left it at that. However, her finding is broader. As noted above, the
    trial judge said: “She did not appear to hold any grudge against the defendant,
    and readily acknowledged all the good things he did for her. I find that it has
    been proven that she had no motive to lie.” </span></p>

    find that the victim <em>did not</em> hold a grudge; she only held that it only <em>appeared</em> to look that way. This was a reasonable finding on the
    evidence. </span></p>

    “she had no motive to lie” – requires more scrutiny. If this was a reference to
    the car loan, for the reasons already given, it was unobjectionable. However,
    given that the trial judge went on to immediately comment on the consequences
    of the victim coming forward, “she had no motive to lie” assumes greater
    significance. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As this court has said in a number of recent
    decisions, trial judges must approach an apparent lack of motive to fabricate
    with great caution when assessing the credibility of a complainant: see <em>R.
    v. S.S.S.</em>, 2021 ONCA 552; <em>R. v. Ignacio</em>, 2021 ONCA 69, 400 C.C.C.
    (3d) 343; <em>R. v. Bartholomew</em>, 2019 ONCA 377, 375 C.C.C. (3d) 354. However,
    to the extent that the trial judge may have strayed into forbidden territory,
    we apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. She was careful not to impose a burden on the appellant.
    Nor can it be said that this factor overwhelmed the trial judge’s assessment of
    the victim’s credibility. It did not infect the rest of her careful reasons in
    which she explained in great detail why she accepted the evidence of the victim
    and found the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
