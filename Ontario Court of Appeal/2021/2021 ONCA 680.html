  <p class=Onappealfrom><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the sentence imposed on
    July 19, 2018 by Justice Shaun S. Nakatsuru of the Superior Court of Justice, with
    reasons reported at 2018 ONSC 5186, 422 C.R.R. (2d) 154.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span lang=EN-CA>By the Court:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;</span></h1>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is beyond doubt that anti-Black racism,
    including both overt and systemic anti-Black racism, has been, and continues to
    be, a reality in Canadian society, and in particular in the Greater Toronto Area.
    That reality is reflected in many social institutions, most notably the
    criminal justice system. It is equally clear that anti-Black racism can have a
    profound and insidious impact on those who must endure it on a daily basis: see <em>R. v. Le</em>, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at paras. 89-97; <i>R. v. <em>Theriault</em></i>,
    2021 ONCA 517, at para. 212, leave to appeal to S.C.C. requested, 39768 (July
    19, 2021); <em>R. v. Parks</em> (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 324 (C.A.), at p. 342,
    leave to appeal refused, [1993] S.C.C.A. No. 481; see also Ontario Human Rights
    Commission, <em>A Collective Impact: Interim report on the inquiry into racial
    profiling and racial discrimination of Black persons by the Toronto Police
    Service</em><i> </i>(Toronto: Government of Ontario, 2018), at p. 19; </span>Ontario
    Association of Children’s Aid Societies, <em><span lang=EN-CA>One Vision One
    Voice: Changing the Child Welfare System for African Canadians</span></em> (Toronto: Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies, 2016), at p. 29<span
lang=EN-CA>. Anti-Black racism must be acknowledged, confronted, mitigated and,
    ultimately, erased. This appeal requires the court to consider how trial judges
    should take evidence of anti-Black racism into account on sentencing.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span lang=EN-CA> <strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>On
    June 28, 2017, a jury found the appellant, Kevin Morris, guilty of possession
    of a loaded prohibited/restricted handgun, contrary to s. 95 of the </span></strong><em>Criminal
    Code</em><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, carrying
    a concealed weapon, contrary to s. 90 of the </span></strong><em>Criminal Code</em><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>, and two other related-gun charges under ss. 91 and
    92 of the </span></strong><em>Criminal Code</em><strong><span style='font-weight:
normal'>. The trial judge stayed the charge arising under s. 91 and entered
    convictions on the other charges. All of the charges arose out of Mr. Morris’s possession
    of a loaded .38 calibre Smith &amp; Wesson handgun. Except for the purposes of fixing
    the sentence on each charge, there is no need in these reasons to examine the
    charges separately.</span></strong></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In July 2018, the trial judge sentenced Mr.
    Morris to 1 day in jail to be followed by 18 months probation.</span><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:1.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:ZWAdobeF'>0F</span><a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-CA><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span
lang=EN-CA> In imposing sentence, the trial judge concluded the respondent
    should receive a sentence of 15 months plus probation for 18 months. Following
    deductions for breaches of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (3 months) and pretrial custody (243 days at a rate of 1.5:1), Mr. Morris was
    left with a net sentence of 1 day plus 18 months probation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence
    imposed. The Crown contends the sentence is manifestly unfit and the trial
    judge made several material errors in his reasons, particularly in his
    treatment of the evidence led by Mr. Morris concerning the impact of overt and institutional
    anti-Black racism. The Crown argues that the decisions of this court in <em>R.
    v. Borde</em> (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.), and <em>R. v. Hamilton</em> (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), remain good law. These cases acknowledge that an
    offender’s personal circumstances, including those tied to overt and
    institutional racism and its multi-faceted effects, can be relevant in
    determining an appropriate sentence. Their ultimate impact on the sentencing
    process will, as with other facts relevant to sentencing, depend on the specifics
    of the individual case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Crown counsel acknowledges the reality of overt
    and institutional racism and its negative impact, particularly within the
    criminal justice system. Crown counsel accepts that the courts, and in
    particular trial judges, must frankly acknowledge that reality and take it into
    account within the sentencing scheme set out by Parliament.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown maintains, however, that the trial
    judge allowed his consideration of the impact of overt and institutional racism
    on Mr. Morris to overwhelm all other considerations relevant to fashioning a
    fit sentence. The result, says the Crown, is a sentence that fails to reflect
    the seriousness of the offences and falls well below the range of appropriate
    sentences established in decisions from this court and the Supreme Court of
    Canada. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits a fit sentence is three years.
    The Crown accepts, however, in light of the passage of time and subsequent
    events, that the incarceration of Mr. Morris at this time would be
    inappropriate.</span><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:1.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:ZWAdobeF'>1F</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></span></a><span
lang=EN-CA> The Crown asks the court to vary the sentence to three years and
    permanently stay the imposition of that sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for Mr. Morris submit the trial judge
    properly admitted, considered, and assessed the detailed and cogent evidence of
    longstanding overt and institutional systemic anti-Black racism and how that
    racism negatively affected Mr. Morris. Counsel do not equate the sentencing of Black
    offenders with the sentencing of Indigenous offenders. They do contend,
    however, that the use of social context evidence in fashioning the appropriate
    sentence, a requirement when sentencing Indigenous offenders, should also play
    a prominent role in determining the appropriate sentence for Black offenders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for Mr. Morris do not ask the court to
    overrule <em>Borde </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>or</span></em><em> Hamilton</em>.
    They submit the court can build on the <em>dicta </em>in those cases. Counsel
    argue the trial judge in this case had a wealth of information, combined with
    the insight of experts, allowing him to much more fully understand the pervasive
    impact of racism on Mr. Morris throughout his life and its relevance in determining
    the appropriate sentence for him. Counsel contend the methodology employed by
    the trial judge sits comfortably with the <em>dicta</em> in <em>Borde </em>and<em> Hamilton</em> and reflects the powerful picture painted by the evidence led by
    the defence on sentencing. Lastly, counsel for Mr. Morris remind the court that
    it must defer to the trial judge’s factual findings, absent a determination those
    findings are unreasonable. Counsel submit the appeal should be dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Several parties intervened. By and large, they
    support the approach taken by the trial judge on sentencing. There are some
    differences in the positions taken by the interveners. Most notably, Aboriginal
    Legal Services takes the position that the detailed “<em>Gladue</em>”
    jurisprudence developed in reference to the application to Indigenous offenders
    of the restraint principle in s. 718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, cannot
    be applied to non-Indigenous offenders: see <em>R. v. Gladue</em>, [1999] 1
    S.C.R. 688. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons set out below, we would allow
    the appeal and vary the sentence to one of two years, less a day, to be
    followed by probation on the terms imposed by the trial judge. We would
    permanently stay that sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal raises important questions of
    general application in sentencing, as well as specific issues relating to this
    case. Our reasons are long. We will begin with a point-form summary of what we regard
    as the principal conclusions in respect of the broader issues. We will then
    outline the evidence at trial, the proceedings on a motion to stay the charges,
    and the evidence led on sentencing by counsel for Mr. Morris. Finally, we will turn
    to the arguments made on the appeal.</span></p>

    man contacted the police, claiming that about 20 minutes earlier he had been
    the victim of a home invasion robbery. He described the robbers as four Black
    men.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Two plainclothes officers in separate unmarked
    vehicles responded to the police radio call reporting the robbery. They saw
    four Black men walking together in a parking lot in the immediate vicinity of
    the robbery. Two of the men went to one vehicle parked in the lot and Mr.
    Morris and the fourth man walked toward a second vehicle. One of the officers used
    his vehicle to block the path of the vehicle Mr. Morris was walking toward. This
    officer identified himself as a police officer and told the two men to stop. Mr.
    Morris fled, the other individual remained.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The officer in the other unmarked vehicle moved
    his vehicle quickly across the parking lot in an effort to cut Mr. Morris off. According
    to the officer’s evidence, he had stopped his vehicle when Mr. Morris ran into
    it and fell to the ground. Mr. Morris got up quickly and fled. He scaled a high
    fence and ran into the parking lot of an adjacent No Frills grocery store.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By the time Mr. Morris was running across the No
    Frills parking lot, uniformed police officers were in pursuit. Officer Faduck
    quickly gained ground on Mr. Morris. He identified himself as a police officer
    and told Mr. Morris to stop. Mr. Morris kept running. </span></p>

    appeared to him that Mr. Morris was trying to remove his jacket as he ran.
    Officer Faduck saw Mr. Morris duck into a stairwell. When he re-emerged from
    the stairwell, he was no longer wearing his jacket. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Officer Faduck continued his pursuit. Shortly

    went back to the stairwell. He found a jacket in a puddle on the ground. In the
    jacket he found a loaded .38 calibre Smith &amp; Wesson handgun. Mr. Morris was
    taken into custody. As it turned out, there was no evidence to charge Mr.
    Morris or any of his three companions with the robbery.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Morris testified at trial. He told a very
    different story. According to him, he and three friends were walking across a
    parking lot. Mr. Morris moved toward the edge of the parking lot, looking for a
    place to urinate. Suddenly, a vehicle approached him, moving very quickly
    across the parking lot toward him. The vehicle struck Mr. Morris and knocked
    him to the ground. Mr. Morris saw someone getting out of the car. He got up and
    ran, fearing that he was about to be attacked. Mr. Morris had been stabbed and
    seriously injured about 22 months earlier. According to Mr. Morris, the person
    getting out of the vehicle that struck him did not identify himself as a police
    officer and Mr. Morris had no reason to think he was a police officer. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Morris indicated, that as he ran, he heard
    the person chasing him say something and he looked around. He realized it was a

    and struck him several times.</span></p>

    new jacket that night. According to him, the jacket caught on the fence when he
    was climbing over it. He last saw it hanging on the fence. Mr. Morris denied ducking
    into the stairwell of the No Frills parking lot. He also denied throwing his
    jacket into a puddle in the stairwell. Mr. Morris insisted he never had
    possession of a gun. It was implicit in Mr. Morris’s testimony that the police took
    the jacket from the fence, placed it in the stairwell and planted the gun in
    the pocket of the jacket.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury’s verdicts make it clear the jury was
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt Mr. Morris had possession of the loaded
    handgun and was lying when he testified he did not leave his jacket in the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that the vehicle driven by
    one of the plainclothes officers struck Mr. Morris and ran over his left foot,
    causing an injury that required medical attention. The trial judge rejected the
    officer’s evidence that Mr. Morris ran into the vehicle after the vehicle had
    stopped. The trial judge concluded that, while the officer was engaged in a
    lawful attempt to stop a fleeing suspect and did not intend to hit Mr. Morris
    with his vehicle, he was driving quickly, aggressively and, in all of the
    circumstances, “very careless[ly]”. The trial judge held that when the officer
    struck Mr. Morris with his vehicle, he violated Mr. Morris’s rights under s. 7
    of the <em>Charter</em>. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also accepted, again contrary to
    Mr. Morris’s evidence, that Mr. Morris was advised of his right to counsel and
    given access to counsel in a timely fashion. The trial judge did, however, find
    a violation of s. 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em> based on certain questions
    which the officers put to Mr. Morris before he had a chance to exercise his
    right to counsel. The trial judge described the questions as “relatively innocuous”
    and the breach as “far from … egregious”. He also noted the Crown did not seek
    to rely on any of the statements made by Mr. Morris. </span></p>

    proceedings, the trial judge described the <em>Charter</em> breaches as
    “relatively minor”. He further indicated that if Mr. Morris was convicted,
    those breaches could potentially be taken into account on sentencing. The trial
    judge did just that when he imposed sentence, reducing what would otherwise
    have been a sentence of 15 months to 12 months.</span></p>

    sentencing. The first, entitled “Expert Report on Crime, Criminal Justice and
    the Experience of Black Canadians in Toronto, Ontario”, describes and analyzes
    the research that has been done on the existence, causes, and impact of anti-Black
    racism in Canadian society, especially in the Toronto area. The report provides
    an historical and social account of the Black experience in Canada. It draws a
    connection between the long history in Canada of overtly racist attitudes and
    social practices and present day institutional and systemic discrimination
    against Black people. The report explains how systemic discrimination in many
    social institutions marginalizes Black people in communities marked by poverty,
    diminished economic and employment opportunities, and a strong and aggressive
    police presence. These factors combine to leave many in the Black community
    with the reasonable perception that Canadian society, and in particular the criminal
    justice system, is racist and unfair.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The authors conclude:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is our opinion that the social
    circumstances of Black Canadians in general, and of Black male Torontonians in
    particular, should be viewed as criminogenic. Elevated levels of offending in
    the types of crimes that typically come to the attention of the police (street
    crimes as opposed to white-collar and corporate crimes), combined with
    discrimination in the justice system itself have resulted in the gross over-representation
    of Black Canadians in our provincial and federal correctional systems. Whereas
    no one individual should be completely absolved of their own responsibility
    when it comes to offending behaviour, the social realities that have produced
    or contributed to such behaviour can be acknowledged, and serve to guide
    judicial decision making.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the sentencing proceedings, the Crown argued
    that this report was inadmissible as the trial judge could properly take
    judicial notice of the existence of overt and systemic anti-Black racism in
    Canadian society and the criminal justice system in particular. The trial judge
    rejected the Crown’s arguments and admitted the report. On appeal, the Crown
    takes no issue with the admissibility of this report. We agree with the Crown’s
    concession.</span></p>

    trial judge could have taken judicial notice of many of the historical and
    social facts referred to in the report: see e.g., <em>Le</em>, at paras. 82-88; <em>Theriault</em>, at paras. 212-18; <em>R. v. Anderson</em>, 2021 NSCA 62 (“<em>Anderson

    Even though much of the report could have been the subject of judicial notice,
    the admission of the report as a whole had value for sentencing purposes. The
    report gave the trial judge the benefit of a scholarly, comprehensive, and
    compelling description of the widespread and pernicious effect of anti-Black
    racism. As the trial judge observed, it helped him understand how Mr. Morris
    ended up where he did.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her report, Ms. Sibblis writes:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Under the weight of anti-Black racism, Mr.
    Morris had little option than to live his life as best he could having been
    influenced by the streets. His overall social circumstances, while not excusing
    his behaviour, have undeniably contributed to Mr. Morris being involved with
    the justice system today. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Morris has also lived, and continues to
    live, in constant fear. He fears the police, other community members, friends
    and foes alike, rivals, unknown dangers, life, death. He fears fellow inmates.
    He fears for his mother’s safety. Mr. Morris fears both freedom and incarceration.
    Mr. Morris’s imagination for what he could become was significantly limited by
    fear, anxiety, and actual threats; it is not positively fostered as his
    suffering was not sufficiently tended to.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>At this time, it would be appropriate to
    provide him with the support and treatment he ought to have received long ago.
    Early intervention might well have changed Mr. Morris’s trajectory and it
    appears as though anti-Black racism was a contributing factor in this omission.
    Since Mr. Morris shows empathy, and has many redeeming qualities, it is a
    reasonable expectation that he will respond well to mental health treatment.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The persons contacted by Ms. Sibblis described Mr.
    Morris as a person with many positive personal characteristics, notably a
    strong sense of empathy. However, in Ms. Sibblis’s opinion, those
    characteristics have been largely submerged in a lifetime of negative experiences,
    many of which are tied, in part at least, to institutional or overt racism.
    According to Ms. Sibblis, the combined impact of those events have left Mr.
    Morris physically and emotionally damaged, unable to obtain meaningful
    employment, in constant fear for his physical safety from both people in his
    community and the police, and without hope for the future.</span></p>

    Mr. Morris, his mother, his pastor, and a family friend. She received a supporting
    letter from a social worker and childhood friend. Ms. Sibblis obtained extensive
    documentation from various schools and educational programs Mr. Morris had attended,
    as well as some medical records. We do not understand the Crown to question the

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The fundamental principle of sentencing (i.e.,
    proportionality) is intimately tied to the fundamental purpose of sentencing —
    the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society through the imposition of
    just sanctions. Whatever weight a judge may wish to accord to the various
    objectives and other principles listed in the <em>Code</em>, the resulting
    sentence must respect the fundamental principle of proportionality. Proportionality
    is the <em>sine qua non</em> of a just sanction. First, the principle ensures
    that a sentence reflects the gravity of the offence. This is closely tied to
    the objective of denunciation. It promotes justice for victims and ensures
    public confidence in the justice system….</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the principle of proportionality
    ensures that a sentence does not exceed what is appropriate, given the moral
    blameworthiness of the offender. In this sense, the principle serves a limiting
    or restraining function and ensures justice for the offender. In the Canadian
    criminal justice system, a just sanction is one that reflects both perspectives
    on proportionality and does not elevate one at the expense of the other.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    C.J. drew a straight line from proportionality to the imposition of a “just”
    sentence under s. 718:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is no surprise, in view of the constraints
    on sentencing, that imposing a proportionate sentence is a highly individualized
    exercise, tailored to the gravity of the offence, the blameworthiness of the
    offender, and the harm caused by the crime…. Only if this is so can the public
    be satisfied that the offender ‘deserved’ the punishment he received and feel a
    confidence in the fairness and rationality of the system…. [Citations and quotation

    of proportionality. On the one hand, it looks to the offender’s culpability and
    responsibility. On the other, proportionality is measured by reference to the
    seriousness of the crime. LeBel J. said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It [proportionality] requires that a sentence
    not <em>exceed</em> what is just and appropriate, given the moral
    blameworthiness of the offender and the gravity of the offence. In this sense,
    the principle serves a limiting or restraining function. However, the
    rights-based, protective angle of proportionality is counter-balanced by its
    alignment with the “just desserts” philosophy of sentencing, which seeks to
    ensure that offenders are held responsible for their actions and that the sentence
    properly reflects and condemns their role in the offence and the harm they
    caused…. [Citations omitted; emphasis in original.]</span></p>

    conduct, the more serious the crime. The gravity of the offence is also
    reflected in the applicable penalty provision. In addition, the specific circumstances
    surrounding the commission of the offence can make the crime more or less serious.
    Parliament has identified some of the features which aggravate the seriousness of

    75-76, the gravity of an offence takes into account the normative wrongfulness
    of the conduct and the harm posed or caused by the conduct. Gun crimes
    involving the possession of loaded, concealed firearms in public places pose a
    real and immediate danger to the public, especially anyone who interacts with
    the gun holder. When the person with the gun is confronted by the police, who
    are engaged in the lawful execution of their duties, the risk increases dramatically.
    It increases yet again when the gun holder flees, and still again when the gun
    holder discards the weapon in a public place. A person who carries a concealed,
    loaded handgun in public undermines the community’s sense of safety and
    security. Carrying a concealed, loaded handgun in a public place in Canada is
    antithetical to the Canadian concept of a free and ordered society: see <em>Nur

    offending. Parliament has drawn the connection between the seriousness of the
    offence, and denunciation and deterrence by identifying various categories of
    serious crimes (e.g., crimes against children, the police, and vulnerable

    communities experience a disproportionate share of serious violent crime in the
    Toronto area. Black youth in particular report higher levels of both violent
    victimization and violent offending than youth from other racial groups. Law-abiding
    members of those communities are the victims of overt and systemic anti-Black
    racism. They are also the victims, both direct and indirect, of the harm caused
    by gun-related crimes in their communities. Are these law-abiding members of
    the community to be told that the message of denunciation and deterrence, which
    applies to gun crimes committed in other communities, is to be muted in gun
    crimes committed against them in their community so the court can acknowledge
    the reality of anti-Black racism, a reality that those members of the community
    know only too well? We strongly doubt that more lenient sentences for the
    perpetrators of gun crimes will be seen by the law-abiding members of the
    community as a positive step towards social equality. Any failure to
    unequivocally and firmly denounce serious gun crimes, like those committed by

    and ever-present fear of many people around him in his community, including the
    police, was offered as an explanation for his possession of a loaded gun. The
    information in both reports supported the inference that Mr. Morris’s fears
    were real, justified and existed, in part, as a result of systemic racism that
    played a role in shaping his perception of his community, his relationship with
    others in the community, and his relationship with the police. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>It was open to the trial judge to find that the evidence of anti-Black
    racism was connected to, or played a role in, Mr. Morris’s strong fear for his
    personal safety in the community. That state of mind offered a mitigating explanation
    for Mr. Morris’s possession of the loaded, concealed handgun. Looked at in this
    way, evidence of anti-Black racism, which played a role in generating the fear
    that helps explain why Mr. Morris had a loaded gun, is akin, for the purposes
    of sentencing, to evidence that Mr. Morris had been terrorized by somebody in
    the community and had armed himself because he genuinely feared that person. In
    either scenario, the offender offers an explanation for possessing a loaded gun,
    which, to some extent, ameliorates the offender’s moral responsibility for that
    choice: see <em>R. v. Boussoulas</em>, 2015 ONSC 1536, at paras. 6-7, 20, aff’d

    above, Mr. Morris’s reasons for choosing to arm himself do not detract from the
    seriousness of the crime he committed. Even if his conduct is made somewhat
    less blameworthy by the explanation offered for possessing the loaded handgun,

    earlier, social context evidence can provide valuable insight, both with
    respect to the need to deter the offender from future conduct, and the
    rehabilitative prospects of the offender. Evidence about an offender’s
    background and circumstances allows the sentencing judge to more accurately
    assess how sometimes competing objectives of sentencing, such as rehabilitation
    and denunciation, can best be blended to produce a sentence that accords with
    the proportionality principle and serves the fundamental purpose of sentencing
    articulated in s. 718. </span></p>

    have shaped a confrontational and adversarial relationship between the police and
    members of the community, especially young Black men. By understanding the
    social milieu in which the offender interacted with the police, the sentencing judge
    is better able to fashion a sentence that, to the extent possible, realistically
    addresses the needs and potential of the offender, as well as the seriousness
    of the offence. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Mr. Morris’s educational and employment history provides a further example
    of how social context evidence can assist in fashioning a fit sentence.
    Considered without the social context evidence, Mr. Morris’s educational and
    employment achievements are meagre and his future prospects seem bleak. Without
    any context, a sentencing judge could well conclude Mr. Morris had little
    interest in either education or employment, and consequently his rehabilitative
    prospects were dim. However, when Mr. Morris’s educational and employment
    background is considered in the context of the information provided by the
    Sibblis Report, a sentencing judge could determine that Mr. Morris’s
    trajectory, as it relates to education and employment, is more reflective of the
    institutional biases and systemic inadequacies faced by Mr. Morris than any
    lack of potential or interest on Mr. Morris’s part. By placing Mr. Morris’s
    educational and employment history in the proper social context, a sentencing
    judge is better able to decide how those parts of Mr. Morris’s background might

    and, if it is, when fixing the length of that incarceration: <em>Gladue</em>,
    at paras. 79, 93. The restraint principle, however, operates within the
    boundaries set by the fundamental principle of proportionality. As stated by
    Moldaver J. in <em>Suter</em>, at para. 56, “the fundamental principle of
    proportionality must prevail in every case”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Although the restraint principle applies when sentencing all
    offenders, s. 718.2(e) applies with “particular attention to the circumstances
    of Aboriginal offenders.” Not surprisingly, given this language, the courts
    have interpreted s. 718.2(e) as signalling Parliament’s direction that a different
    approach should be taken when applying the restraint principle to the
    sentencing of Indigenous offenders. That approach was first laid down in <em>Gladue</em> and further developed in <em>Ipeelee</em>. None of the parties take exception
    to the methodology developed in those cases, as applied to Indigenous offenders.
    Some of the interveners, however, submit this court should extend that approach
    to the sentencing of Black offenders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Indigenous offenders were singled out in s. 718.2(e) for two reasons.
    First, the problems associated with over-incarceration exist with devasting
    force in Indigenous communities: <em>Gladue</em>, at paras. 58-65; <em>Ipeelee</em>,
    at paras. 56-58. Second, for many Indigenous offenders and their communities, some
    of the principles and objectives underlying sentencing in Part XXIII do not
    represent Indigenous values or reflect the unique experiences and perspectives
    held by many Indigenous communities. In short, what amounts to a “just”
    sentence from a non-Aboriginal vantage point will not necessarily be seen as a “just”
    sentence from the very different historical and cultural vantage point of the Indigenous
    offender and community: <em>Gladue</em>, at paras. 70-74, 77.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The unique circumstances of Indigenous offenders, which require
    special consideration when addressing the restraint principle, include both the
    systemic and background factors which played a role in bringing the offender
    before the court, and the unique Indigenous perspective as to how best to
    achieve a just sentence which protects the community: <em>Gladue</em>, at
    paras. 66, 93.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 73, the court acknowledged that
    systemic and background factors, including institutional biases and
    discrimination, could play a role in determining the Indigenous offender’s
    degree of moral responsibility for the crime. In addition, the unique cultural
    and historical factors, which shaped Indigenous attitudes toward crime and
    punishment, could have an effect on the selection of the sanction which best achieves
    the purpose of sentencing as laid down in s. 718. Addressing the significance
    of cultural and historical differences, LeBel J. observed, at para. 74:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The second set of circumstances <span
style='color:black'>—</span> the types of sanctions which may be appropriate <span
style='color:black'>—</span> bears not on the degree of culpability of the
    offender, but on the effectiveness of the sentence itself. As Cory and
    Iacobucci JJ. point out, at para. 73 of <em>Gladue</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>:</span></em> “What is important to recognize is that,
    for many if not most aboriginal offenders, the current concepts of sentencing
    are inappropriate because they have frequently not responded to the needs,
    experiences, and perspectives of aboriginal people or aboriginal communities.” As
    the [Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples] indicates, at p. 309 [of its
    report, <em>Bridging the Cultural Divide: A Report on Aboriginal People and
    Criminal Justice in Canada</em> (Ottawa, 1996)], the “crushing failure” of the
    Canadian criminal justice system <em>vis-à-vis</em> Aboriginal peoples is due
    to “the fundamentally different world views of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
    people with respect to such elemental issues as the substantive content of
    justice and the process of achieving justice”. The <em>Gladue</em> principles
    direct sentencing judges to abandon the presumption that all offenders and all
    communities share the same values when it comes to sentencing and to recognize
    that, given these fundamentally different world views, different or alternative
    sanctions may more effectively achieve the objectives of sentencing in a
    particular community.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Counsel for some of the interveners argue that the circumstances of Indigenous
    offenders, which justify a different approach to sentencing, apply with equal
    force to Black offenders. They point out that over-incarceration of Black
    offenders is a well-documented phenomenon in the Canadian justice system. Counsel
    submit that the negative impact of long-term and widespread discrimination
    against Indigenous people is not unlike the impact of anti-Black racism on the Black
    community. Both communities share educational, economic, and social disadvantages.
    Perhaps most significantly, they share a very negative experience with and a
    profound distrust of the criminal justice system.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>We do not agree that this court should equate Indigenous offenders
    and Black offenders for the purposes of s. 718.2(e). We come to that conclusion
    for two reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA> Sentencing policy falls to be set, first and foremost, by
    Parliament. Parliament chose to specifically single out one group – Aboriginal
    offenders – in the context of the operation of the restraint principle in
    sentencing, especially as applied to imprisonment. As said in <em>Gladue</em>,
    at para. 37:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Rather, the logical meaning to be derived from
    the special reference to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders, juxtaposed
    as it is against a general direction to consider “the circumstances” for all
    offenders, is that sentencing judges should pay particular attention to the
    circumstances of aboriginal offenders because those circumstances are unique,
    and different from those of non-aboriginal offenders. The fact that the
    reference to aboriginal offenders is contained in s. 718.2(e), in particular,
    dealing with restraint in the use of imprisonment, suggests that there is
    something different about aboriginal offenders which may specifically make
    imprisonment a less appropriate or less useful sanction. [Emphasis omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Similarly, in <em>Ipeelee</em>, the court, at para. 59, read the
    reference to Aboriginal offenders in s. 718.2(e) as indicating their
    circumstances were unique and materially different from those of non-Aboriginal
    offenders. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The language of s. 718.2(e) could not be clearer. Aboriginal
    offenders have been singled out for the purposes of the application of the
    restraint principle described in s. 718.2(e). It does not fall to the court to effectively
    amend that language to include other identifiable groups.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In any event, the rationale offered in <em>Gladue</em> and <em>Ipeelee</em> for applying the restraint principle differently in respect of Indigenous
    offenders does not apply to Black offenders. Although there can be no doubt
    that the impact of anti-Black racism on a specific offender may mitigate that
    offender’s responsibility for the crime, just as with Indigenous offenders,
    there is no basis to conclude that Black offenders, or Black communities, share
    a fundamentally different view of justice, or what constitutes a “just”
    sentence in any given situation. The Indigenous offender’s culture and
    historical relationship with non-Indigenous Canada is truly unique. That
    uniqueness explains the very specific and exclusive reference to “Aboriginal
    offenders” in s. 718.2(e).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Although we would not equate Black offenders with Indigenous
    offenders, for the purposes of s. 718.2(e), the <em>Gladue</em>/<em>Ipeelee</em> jurisprudence can inform the sentencing of Black offenders in several respects:
    see <em>Borde</em>, at para. 30. Just as with the discrimination suffered by Indigenous
    offenders, courts should take judicial notice of the existence of anti-Black
    racism in Canada and its potential impact on individual offenders. Courts
    should admit evidence on sentencing directed at the existence of anti-Black
    racism in the offender’s community, and the impact of that racism on the offender’s
    background and circumstances. Similarly, in considering the restraint
    principle, courts should bear in mind well-established over-incarceration of
    Black offenders, particularly young male offenders. Finally, as with Indigenous
    offenders, the discrimination suffered by Black offenders and its effect on
    their background, character, and circumstances may, in a given case, play a
    role in fixing the offender’s moral responsibility for the crime, and/or blending
    the various objectives of sentencing to arrive at an appropriate sanction in
    the circumstances. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The restraint principle plays a specific and important role in
    sentencing for serious crimes like crimes involving the unlawful possession of
    loaded handguns. Because of the seriousness of crimes involving the possession
    of loaded handguns, some term of imprisonment will usually be required to
    reflect the seriousness of the crime. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The requirement of a sentence of imprisonment does not, however, end
    the operation of the restraint principle. That principle requires the court, if
    it determines that a sentence of less than two years imprisonment would be
    appropriate, to consider whether the term of imprisonment could be served in
    the community under a conditional sentence: <em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 742.1.
    The restraint principle favours conditional sentences over-incarceration if a
    conditional sentence is consistent with the proportionality principle: see <em>R.
    v. R.N.S.</em>, 2000 SCC 7, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 149, at para. 21. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>After <em>Nur</em> struck down the mandatory minimum, a conditional sentence
    is statutorily available for offences under s. 95. As persuasively laid out in <em>Anderson
    (NSCA)</em>, a carefully fashioned conditional sentence that is responsive,
    both to the needs of denunciation and deterrence and the rehabilitative
    potential of the offender, can, in some situations, be a fit sentence for a s.
    95 offence: see also <em>R. v. Shunmuganathan</em>, 2016 ONCJ 519; <em>R. v.
    Dalton</em></span><span class=EmphasisStrongChar><span lang=EN-CA

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA> A conditional sentence, like that described in <em>Anderson (NSCA)</em>,
    at paras. 126-41, can only be available if counsel provides the court with the
    information needed to warrant the imposition of a conditional sentence. Not
    only must the information speak to the offender’s circumstances, it must include
    proposed terms which will meaningfully address the need for deterrence,
    denunciation, and ongoing supervision of the offender. The information provided
    by counsel on sentence must give the sentencing judge reason to believe the
    offender is committed to the terms of the proposed conditional sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Counsel’s efforts alone will of course not be enough. The resources
    needed by counsel to properly put forward this kind of information must be available,
    as must the resources needed to effectively implement a conditional sentence
    tailored to the needs of the offender like the sentence in <em>Anderson (NSCA)</em>.
    The proposed federal legislation, combined with commitments made in the government’s
    2020 economic statement, suggest the previous government intended to make the
    necessary resources available. Hopefully, that commitment will be renewed and
    acted upon in the immediate future: see Bill C-22, <em>An Act to amend the
    Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em>, 2nd Sess., 43rd
    Parl., 2021; see also Canada, <em>Supporting Canadians and Fighting COVID-19:

lang=EN-CA>The use of conditional sentences when sentencing young Black
    offenders, in appropriate cases, also carries the added advantage of
    addressing, at least as it relates to the offender before the court, the ongoing
    systemic problem of the over-incarceration of young Black offenders. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Restraint also operates in another way. Even if the sentencing judge
    decides incarceration is necessary, there is still a question of how long the
    sentence should be. A sentence of more than two years excludes the possibility
    of probation: <em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 731. If the sentencing judge determines
    that the range of sentence for the particular offence and offender includes a
    two-year sentence and that probation would assist the offender’s
    rehabilitation, the restraint principle favours imposing a sentence of no more
    than two years, even if a somewhat longer period of incarceration would also fall
    within the appropriate range. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

    351, sentences at or just below the two-year mark may be appropriate for some
    s. 95 offences. When the sentencing judge determines that an appropriate
    sentence is in that range, counsel and the sentencing judge must fully explore
    various options which could eliminate or reduce the offender’s period of actual
    incarceration while still giving effect to the proportionality principle. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The Admissibility of the Report and Evidence of Ms. Sibblis</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>We have already summarized the substance of Ms. Sibblis’s report and
    her testimony (see paras. 44-52). The Crown’s complaint with respect to the
    admissibility of Ms. Sibblis’s report and testimony is a relatively narrow one.
    Counsel submits that, although Ms. Sibblis was tendered as an expert witness,
    she was not properly qualified at the sentencing proceeding. Neither her areas
    of expertise, nor the specific subject matters on which she was qualified to
    give opinion evidence were identified. Consequently, argues the Crown, her report
    and testimony roam over a wide variety of subjects, some of which required that
    she be properly qualified as an expert. For example, the Crown argues that Ms.
    Sibblis was not properly qualified to give opinion evidence, either about Mr.
    Morris’s state of mind, or any mental disorder he may have suffered from at the
    relevant time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s argument should be considered in the context of the
    applicable evidentiary provisions in Part XXIII of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>. Those provisions swing the evidentiary door </span></em>open
    on sentencing. The rules of evidence are relaxed to facilitate the production
    of any information that could help the sentencing judge arrive at a fit
    sentence. Given the highly individualized nature of the sentencing inquiry, the
    concept of relevance captures a broad band of information: see <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, ss. 723, 726.1. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Information that sheds light on the offender’s background,
    character, and circumstances, or helps explain why the offender committed the
    offence, is relevant on sentencing and potentially admissible. Much of the
    information provided by Ms. Sibblis goes to the appellant’s background,
    character, and circumstances. She tells Mr. Morris’s life story as a young Black
    man growing up and living in Toronto. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The biographical information tracing Mr. Morris’s life experiences
    laid out in the Sibblis Report was clearly admissible on sentencing. That
    information included primary source documents and statements from Mr. Morris
    and others close to him, including his mother. Although much of the information
    was hearsay, the trial judge could rely on that information if he concluded it
    was credible and trustworthy: <em>R. v. Gardiner</em>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, at p.
    414. No particular expertise was required for Ms. Sibblis to chronicle Mr.
    Morris’s background history and circumstances. To the extent that the Sibblis
    Report chronicles Mr. Morris’s life, it is not unlike a presentence report,
    although it is much more thorough and detailed than most presentence reports.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Sibblis Report does go on to connect Mr. Morris’s disadvantaged
    upbringing and circumstances to overt and systemic anti-Black racism. Ms.
    Sibblis offers her assessment of the impact of that connection on the choices
    Mr. Morris has made throughout his life, and on his outlook for the future. The
    disadvantages suffered by Mr. Morris are part of his background and character
    and are relevant to determining the appropriate sentence. Ms. Sibblis’s opinion
    that anti-Black racism plays a role in the existence and impact of those
    disadvantages is also relevant to determining the fit sentence. An explanation
    for a disadvantage or circumstance which played a role in the offender’s
    commission of the offence can shed light on how that disadvantage should be
    taken into account on sentencing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The parts of the Sibblis Report that draw a connection between
    systemic factors and Mr. Morris’s commission of the offences have much in
    common with <em>Gladue</em> reports. The Sibblis Report is helpful for some of
    the same reasons that <em>Gladue</em> reports have proven to be helpful when
    sentencing Indigenous offenders. As with <em>Gladue</em> reports, the Sibblis
    Report places Mr. Morris’s history and circumstances in a social context which
    enhances the sentencing judge’s understanding of Mr. Morris. A better
    understanding of the offender is always a good thing on sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>A report very similar to the Sibblis Report was admitted without
    objection in <em>Jackson</em>. Similar reports (IRCAs) are regularly admitted
    in Nova Scotia criminal courts. In <em>Anderson (NSCA)</em>, the Nova Scotia
    Court of Appeal strongly endorses the use of IRCAs in sentencing, especially for
    young Black offenders. As the court in <em>Anderson (NSCA)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> notes, at para. 83, the federal government has
    recently endorsed the use of IRCAs and proposes to provide funding for them. </span></em></span></p>

lang=EN-CA>We accept that, in some respects, offering an opinion that draws the
    connection between an offender’s lived experiences and the impact of anti-Black
    racism will require expertise. Ms. Sibblis’s academic and clinical experiences provided
    that expertise. She was competent to offer an opinion as to the connection
    between anti-Black racism and Mr. Morris’s involvement in the criminal justice
    system.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Parts of the Sibblis Report and her evidence arguably offered
    opinions with respect to matters that went beyond Ms. Sibblis’s apparent expertise.
    Some of her comments about the extent and effect of Mr. Morris’s physical
    injuries suffered in 2013, as well as her opinions about Mr. Morris’s mental state
    and his specific state of mind, arguably required expertise beyond that which
    is self-evident from a review of Ms. Sibblis’s credentials. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Even if Ms. Sibblis was not qualified to offer certain opinions
    about Mr. Morris’s mental state, or the extent of his physical injuries, the
    Crown was not prejudiced by the opinions she gave. The trial judge had ample
    evidence, apart from Ms. Sibblis’s opinion, to support the conclusion that Mr.
    Morris had significant emotional difficulties. The trial judge was entitled to
    accept the psychiatric report prepared 11 months before the offences. That
    report suggested a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”). The
    Sibblis Report provided information from Mr. Morris about his mental state in
    the ensuing period. According to him, he continued to experience the same intense
    and ongoing fears, and sense of hopelessness he had related to the psychiatrist.
    The trial judge could accept Mr. Morris’s statements, as reported by Ms. Sibblis.
    Those statements supported the continuing applicability of the psychiatric
    diagnosis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Similarly, apart from Ms. Sibblis’s opinions about Mr. Morris’s
    physical injuries and their ongoing effect, the documentation established the
    seriousness of those injuries. It was open to the trial judge to conclude those
    injuries continued to present serious problems for Mr. Morris. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It would have been better had counsel specifically identified for
    the trial judge the areas of Ms. Sibblis’s report with respect to which the
    Crown maintained there were legitimate doubts as to her qualifications to offer
    the opinions contained in the report. After hearing argument on the contested
    areas of the report, the trial judge could have determined the areas in which Ms.
    Sibblis was entitled to give expert opinion evidence. In doing so, the trial
    judge would have set the parameters of her testimony and identified the parts
    of her report, if any, that went beyond her expertise and would not be
    considered by the trial judge.<b> </b>This approach would have served the same purpose
    as a formal <em>voir dire</em>, but in a more expeditious manner, well-suited
    to the introduction of evidence on sentencing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>We would add one further observation with respect to reports like
    the Sibblis Report. Persons authoring presentence reports and <em>Gladue</em> reports are required to present an objective and balanced picture of the
    offender for the court: <em>R. v. Lawson</em>, 2012 BCCA 508, 294 C.C.C. (3d)
    369, at para. 28. Persons preparing social context reports are under the same
    obligation. Ms. Sibblis acknowledged this obligation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>To maintain that objectivity, the report cannot purport to speak for
    the offender or advocate on the offender’s behalf. A social context report must
    also distinguish between facts and an offender’s perceptions and beliefs as
    stated to the author. Both perceptions and facts are important, but they are
    not the same thing. For example, an offender’s assertion he was mistreated by

    cannot be presented as facts in the report. This caution is especially

lang=EN-CA>A properly prepared social context report must also carefully
    consider the information available in the primary source documents collected.
    Any claim that a particular event or incident is explained by institutional
    bias can only be objectively assessed by reference to the actual events as
    revealed in reliable primary source documents such as medical records. For
    example, the Sibblis Report suggests that the failure to follow-up on Mr.
    Morris’s diagnosed psychiatric issues may have been a reflection of systemic
    racism. The medical records, however, indicate that the psychiatrist did
    prescribe medication and follow-up psychotherapy. Mr. Morris chose not to take
    the medication or go back to the psychiatrist for the psychotherapy.</span></p>

    sentencing in Ontario in appropriate cases. We are confident that with more
    experience in preparing these reports, and added guidance from the courts,

    of the Offences</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As indicated earlier (paras. 75-78), the trial judge erred in
    holding that systemic racism and its impact on Mr. Morris could mitigate the
    seriousness of the offences committed by Mr. Morris and, in doing so, reduce
    the significance of the objectives of denunciation and general deterrence in the
    fixing of an appropriate sentence. The seriousness of Mr. Morris’s crimes is not
    diminished by evidence which speaks to his reason for committing the crimes. Specifically,
    the explanation offered by counsel and accepted by the trial judge for Mr.
    Morris’s possession of the gun, his flight from the police, and his disposal of
    the gun, while possibly relevant to his degree of personal responsibility, in
    no way reduced the seriousness of the offences, or the need to denounce in no
    uncertain terms Mr. Morris’s criminal conduct.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong><span lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>Although
    Mr. Morris was convicted of four gun-related charges, when considering the
    seriousness of his conduct, it is appropriate to focus on the s. 95 charge, the
    most serious of the four charges. That section prohibits the possession of a
    loaded restricted/prohibited firearm. </span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Section 95 criminalizes a broad range of conduct. Mr. Morris’s actions
    fall at the “true crime” end of the spectrum of the conduct prohibited by s.
    95. As this court and, more importantly, the Supreme Court of Canada have
    indicated, crimes like those committed by Mr. Morris call for denunciatory
    sentences. In most cases, penitentiary terms will be required. In some situations,
    where there are strong mitigating factors, sentences at or near the maximum
    reformatory sentence (two years, less a day), may be imposed: see <em>Smickle</em>,
    at para. 30; <em>Nur (ONCA)</em>, at paras. 6, 17-23 and 206; and <em>Nur (SCC)</em>,
    at para. 82.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge imposed a sentence that was far below the range described
    in cases like <em>Nur</em> and <em>Smickle</em>. In doing so, he erred in
    principle by deprecating the seriousness of the offences committed by Mr.
    Morris and the need to unequivocally denounce the criminal conduct engaged in
    by Mr. Morris through the sentence imposed on him. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>At the same time, the trial judge’s reasons overstate the impact of
    Mr. Morris’s circumstances on <em>his ability to choose</em> whether or not to arm
    himself with a loaded, concealed handgun. There is no evidence from Mr. Morris about
    how he came to carry around a loaded, concealed handgun. In fact, Mr. Morris
    insisted under oath he did no such thing. Absent any evidence from Mr. Morris as
    to why he came to arm himself, it simply cannot be assumed that he was armed
    because<b> </b>he thought he had little choice in the matter. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA> The evidence does, however, offer an explanation, rooted in the
    social context evidence, that explains why Mr. Morris made such a bad and
    dangerous choice. That explanation points to circumstances, many of which were
    not only beyond Mr. Morris’s control, but were in fact imposed on him as a
    consequence of systemic and overt anti-Black racism in various social
    institutions.</span></p>

    the sentence imposed and are sufficient to warrant appellate intervention. We will,

lang=EN-CA>The trial judge accepted that Mr. Morris was remorseful. There was

    regretted the mess he had made of his life, and wanted to change. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    acceptance of responsibility offers good reason to hope the offender will not

    meaningful mitigation only when accompanied by an acceptance of responsibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

lang=EN-CA> Mr. Morris denied committing the offences at trial. He falsely
    accused the police of planting the firearm and other serious misconduct, both
    in his evidence on the stay motion and in his evidence before the jury. He said
    nothing on sentencing to resile from the false evidence he gave at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Mr. Morris, of course, cannot be punished on sentencing for denying
    the allegations or falsely accusing the police of serious misconduct. However,
    both are relevant when considering whether Mr. Morris took any responsibility
    for his actions. Nothing in the Sibblis Report, or in Mr. Morris’s statement at
    sentencing, suggests he was prepared to take responsibility for anything. A
    refusal to acknowledge, much less take responsibility for, criminal conduct, did
    not augur well for Mr. Morris’s rehabilitative potential and raises real
    concerns about the risk that he will reoffend. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

lang=EN-CA>The trial judge was satisfied that Mr. Morris had the loaded
    handgun, at least in part, because of his precarious mental state. On the trial
    judge’s findings, Mr. Morris constantly feared for his life in his community.
    He felt helpless and saw nothing positive in his future.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also accepted there was no evidence Mr. Morris had
    the loaded gun for any specific criminal purpose. We take this to mean there
    was no evidence Mr. Morris was involved in criminal activity and used the gun
    as a tool of that trade. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Both findings were open to the trial judge. With respect to Mr.
    Morris’s mental state, the trial judge had Mr. Morris’s description of his
    state of mind, as provided to Ms. Sibblis, the psychiatric report from January
    2014, and undisputed evidence concerning specific traumatic events, including
    two prior stabbings. With respect to the conclusion there was no basis to find
    he had the gun for an ulterior criminal purpose, the trial judge relied on the
    character evidence offered on behalf of Mr. Morris at sentencing. Mr. Morris also
    had no criminal record.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Both factors identified by the trial judge offered some mitigation
    of Mr. Morris’s personal culpability and blameworthiness. The trial judge
    recognized this mitigation, but also concluded that Mr. Morris’s reasons for
    possessing a loaded, concealed handgun lessened the need to denounce Mr.
    Morris’s conduct.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge erred in holding that Mr. Morris’s explanation for
    possessing the loaded, concealed handgun rendered denunciation less important. Mr.
    Morris’s explanation in no way diminished the dangerousness of his conduct, or
    the harm it caused to the community.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The explanation accepted by the trial judge for Mr. Morris’s
    possession of the loaded handgun had to be taken into account, along with other
    mitigating factors, when assessing the personal culpability component of the
    proportionality inquiry. The social context evidence accepted by the trial
    judge put Mr. Morris’s choice to carry a loaded, concealed handgun in a light
    that reduced his personal culpability. That same evidence offered valuable
    insights into Mr. Morris’s background and character and, in particular, his
    potential for rehabilitation that had to be taken into account when blending
    the various objectives of sentencing.</span></p>

    the Gun</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In his reasons on the motion to stay the proceedings (summarized
    above, at paras. 26-32), the trial judge found that he was not satisfied Mr.
    Morris knew the plainclothes officers, who initially attempted to stop him,
    were police officers. The trial judge was, however, satisfied that Mr. Morris
    knew the uniformed officer chasing him across the No Frills parking lot was a
    police officer. Mr. Morris did not stop, but on the trial judge’s findings
    continued to run until he was caught and tackled by the police officer. The
    trial judge further held that Mr. Morris disposed of the loaded handgun in the
    stairwell of the parking lot while running from the uniformed police officer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge declined to treat Mr. Morris’s flight from the
    police or the disposal of the loaded handgun in a public area as aggravating
    factors on sentence. He described both as “reflexive” and “impulsive” reactions
    to the confrontation with the police. On the trial judge’s reasoning, that reaction
    was explained in part by Mr. Morris’s fears and distrust of the police. His
    fear and mistrust were in turn the product of the systemic anti-Black racism
    engrained in the policing of communities like the one Mr. Morris had grown up in. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge made his findings as to why Mr. Morris ran in the
    absence of any such evidence from Mr. Morris. Mr. Morris had falsely denied
    running from the uniformed officer, claiming he had stopped as soon as he saw
    that it was a police officer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>On the trial judge’s findings, Mr. Morris’s flight from the
    plainclothes officers cannot be treated as an aggravating factor. However, his
    decision to continue to run once he knew he was being chased by a police
    officer does increase the seriousness of the offence. This is so for two
    reasons. First, fleeing from the police while in possession of a loaded handgun
    increases the risk of a confrontation, during which the weapon may be discharged
    deliberately, or even accidentally. Either substantially increases the risk to
    the public. Second, Mr. Morris’s decision to run while armed with a loaded
    handgun endangered the safety of the police officers who were engaged in the
    lawful execution of their duty. Doing so aggravates the seriousness of the offence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>We would also hold that the trial judge made an unreasonable finding
    of fact when he concluded Mr. Morris’s flight and disposal of the gun was an “impulsive
    reaction” caused by his fear of the police and a concern he would not be treated
    fairly. The trial judge’s analysis ignores that Mr. Morris was in the act of
    committing a serious crime when confronted by the police. He had to know that
    if caught with a loaded gun, he would be arrested and incarcerated. Mr. Morris chose
    to run and attempted to dispose of the weapon out of the sight of the police
    before he was apprehended. The only reasonable inference is that Mr. Morris ran
    and disposed of the gun in an effort to avoid being caught and charged with a
    serious crime. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also made an error in concluding the disposal of the
    handgun in a public place was not “a weighty aggravating factor” in this case.
    The trial judge discounted the significance of that factor because the place
    where the gun was thrown was not “easily accessible to a passerby or innocents.”
    On the evidence, Mr. Morris threw the gun away in a public stairwell located in
    a parking lot of a grocery store. The stairwell was readily accessible by the
    public, even if it was not used a great deal. In any event, leaving a loaded
    firearm anywhere in a public space is clearly a significant aggravating factor.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><span lang=EN-CA>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Mitigation for the Breach of Mr. Morris’s <em>Charter</em> Rights</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[173]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge reduced the sentence by three months on account of
    the breach of Mr. Morris’s rights under ss. 7 and 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em>.
    Those breaches are described above (see paras. 28-32). The trial judge was
    particularly concerned with the breach of s. 7, which involved one of the plainclothes
    officers driving over Mr. Morris’s foot in his attempt to detain Mr. Morris. The
    trial judge did not invoke s. 24(1) of the <em>Charter</em>, but relied on the
    principle that state misconduct can mitigate sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>All parties agree that a trial judge can reduce a sentence to take
    into account state misconduct relating to the circumstances of the offence or
    the offender:<em> Nasogaluak</em>, at paras. 3, 47. Excessive use of force in
    the course of detaining or arresting an individual, even if the arrest or
    detention is for a different offence than the offence ultimately prosecuted, can
    constitute state misconduct relating to the circumstances of the offence or
    offender. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge was satisfied the officer’s excessive use of force
    was sufficiently serious to warrant a reduction in the sentence. In addressing
    the seriousness of the misconduct, the trial judge relied, not only on the
    physical consequences suffered by Mr. Morris, but on the negative impact the aggressive
    police conduct had on the perception of the police within the community. The
    trial judge concluded that some mitigation of the sentence would recognize the
    reality of that perception.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>As the trial judge acknowledged, the seriousness of Mr. Morris’s
    crimes required a significant term of imprisonment. The possession of a loaded,
    concealed handgun in a public place, the flight from the police, and the
    disposal of the loaded weapon in a public place were all aggravating factors. As
    indicated earlier, we see no reason to depart from the range fixed in cases
    like <em>Nur</em> and <em>Smickle</em>. In most cases, at the “true crime” end
    of the spectrum, a penitentiary sentence will be necessary for a s. 95 offence.
    In some cases, sentences at or near a maximum reformatory sentence will be
    appropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There are mitigating factors in this case favouring a sentence at
    the low end of the range. More importantly, Mr. Morris was a young first
    offender at the time of sentencing. He has strong emotional support from his
    mother and others who are close to him. As revealed in the Sibblis Report, Mr.
    Morris has many positive features, and rehabilitative potential. </span></p>

avoid'><span lang=EN-CA>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The moral blameworthiness of Mr. Morris’s
    conduct is mitigated by his mental and physical health issues, as well as his
    educational and economic disadvantages. All of those factors are influenced by
    the systemic anti-Black racism Mr. Morris has experienced. The factors can only
    properly be understood, for the purposes of determining the appropriate
    sentence, by having regard to that context. <strong><span style='font-weight:
normal'>The three-month deduction in the sentence to take account of state
    misconduct during the attempt to detain and arrest Mr. Morris can also be viewed

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Taking into account the mitigating and aggravating factors, we think
    the trial judge could have imposed a sentence ranging from a sentence at or
    near the maximum reformatory term, to a penitentiary sentence of three years.
    When the appropriate sentencing range includes sentences <strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>at or</span></strong> below the two-year mark, a
    sentencing judge must give careful consideration to the imposition of a
    conditional sentence. As outlined earlier, conditional sentences, properly
    used, can ameliorate the longstanding problem of the over-incarceration of
    young Black men. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Mr. Morris was in custody on other charges when sentenced on these
    charges. Understandably, given the positions of the parties, no one suggested Mr.
    Morris should receive a conditional sentence. We would observe, however, that
    all other factors being equal, had Mr. Morris been before the courts
    exclusively on these charges and had a conditional sentence, like that ordered
    in <em>Anderson (NSCA)</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> been
    available, the trial judge would have had to give that option serious
    consideration.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>We also agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that a term of
    probation was necessary. Probation provided for an extended period of
    supervision and access to culturally-sensitive counselling. Both had the
    potential to further Mr. Morris’s rehabilitation and provide added long-term
    safety for the community. As probation can only be imposed if a period of
    incarceration is no more than two years, the restraint principle favoured a
    sentence of two years or less: see <em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 731.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> </span>The court received fresh evidence indicating Mr. Morris had
    been charged with offences related to a home invasion robbery in April 2017
    while on bail on these charges. He was held in custody. Mr. Morris pled guilty
    to those charges and in June 2019 received a sentence of 3 years, 5 months and
    15 days after a credit of 32.5 months for pretrial custody. Mr. Morris was
    released on day parole in July 2020 and full parole in January 2021. He spent a
    total of approximately 3 years and 3 months in jail on these charges and the
    charges related to the home invasion. </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>It would appear from Mr. Morris’s affidavit filed as
    fresh evidence, that although he continues to have significant problems,
    particularly with his health, he has taken responsibility for his criminal
    actions and made several positive steps to better himself and avoid future
    contact with the criminal justice system.                                                                                                 </p>

lang=EN-CA> </span>In <em><span lang=EN-CA>Anderson (NSCA)</span></em>, at
    para. 159, the court indicates “the use of denunciation and deterrence to
    protect societal values should be informed by a recognition of society’s role
    in undermining the offender’s prospects as a pro-social and law-abiding citizen.”
    If this passage means that deterrence and denunciation take on less
    significance in sentencing for serious crimes if society is somehow complicit
    in the circumstances relevant to the commission of the offence, we must, with
    respect and for the reasons set out, disagree with that conclusion. </p>
