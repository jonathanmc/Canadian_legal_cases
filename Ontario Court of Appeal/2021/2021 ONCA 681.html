  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Feldman J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Gordon Dunk Farms Ltd., suffered
    a loss when its hog barn collapsed on May 6, 2014. The two principals of the
    appellant, Gordon Dunk and his son Floyd Dunk, are knowledgeable hog farmers,
    who had the barn constructed 1.5 years earlier by the three respondents. McNeil
    Engineering &amp; Construction Inc. (“McNeil”) designed the barn, HFH Inc. (“HFH”)
    oversaw its construction, and Franken Concrete Forming (2011) (“Franken”) undertook
    the concrete work. Floyd Dunk’s son and brother were in the barn when it
    collapsed and were lucky to survive.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant had insurance that covered part,
    but not all, of the loss. The insurer paid the appellant for the covered loss
    and retained a lawyer to sue the respondents to pursue the subrogated claim.
    The same lawyer was also retained to recover the balance of the loss on behalf
    of the appellant directly. That lawyer did not commence the action until May
    24, 2016. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>All parties brought motions for summary judgment
    to determine whether the action was brought within time or was statute barred.
    The issue before the motion judge was when the appellant knew or ought to have
    known that it had a claim against the respondents. Shortly after the barn
    collapsed, the insurance adjuster retained an expert to examine the barn and
    report on the cause of the collapse. The motion judge found that the principals
    knew they had a claim, within the meaning of the <em>Limitations Act</em><i>,
    2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched. B. (the “Act”), before they received the final
    expert report on May 21, 2014.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> The action was therefore statute barred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Background Facts</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2011, the appellant decided to build a new
    hog barn on its property. The principals engaged the respondent McNeil to
    prepare the design, and the respondent HFH as contractor to oversee the
    construction, based on the McNeil drawings. They also engaged the respondent Franken
    to do the concrete work. The barn was completed in 2013. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The barn was a rectangular one-story building
    300 feet long and 60 feet wide. The pigs lived on concrete floor panels above
    an eight-foot deep tank. Walls running the length of the tank supported the
    floor panels and formed channels referred to as “raceways”. The pigs’ manure
    fell through the floor panels and accumulated in the raceways. A propeller in
    the tank would agitate the manure and cause it to flow through the raceways
    toward an exit to be pumped out. During construction, Floyd Dunk, who is
    knowledgeable about barn construction, was aware that there was no lateral
    bracing between the raceway walls, but trusted the engineer with respect to
    what was required.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the barn collapsed, the appellant was aware
    that the raceway walls had collapsed. The insurance adjuster retained two
    engineering firms to prepare preliminary reports, R.J. Burnside &amp;
    Associates Limited (“Burnside”) and Brown &amp; Beattie Building Science
    Engineering (“Brown”). They both attended on May 8 and provided their preliminary
    reports that same day. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Burnside provided a preliminary view on
    causation, which was that agitation of the manure moved one raceway wall over,
    which generated a manure surge that toppled the adjacent walls in a cascading
    effect. Burnside subsequently discovered a conflict of interest and had no
    further involvement. Brown did not provide a causation opinion until its final
    report, delivered on May 21. Its “preliminary conclusion” in the May 21 report,
    based on the information available, was that manure agitation and pumping
    caused different levels of manure on either side of the raceway walls,
    resulting in uneven force on the walls, causing them to collapse.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In their cross-examinations, both Gordon and
    Floyd Dunk acknowledged that with their experience and understanding of barn
    construction and operation, they believed they understood or knew the cause of
    the barn collapse, but because they are not engineers, they were speculating
    regarding the cause of the collapse (my paraphrase). <a name="_Hlk83573908">Floyd
    Dunk testified that he did not see Brown’s final report of May 21, 2014 until shortly
    before his cross-examination on February 26, 2019.</a></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The action was commenced on May 24, 2016. The
    respondents delivered their statements of defence that included a limitations
    defence, and moved for summary judgment. The appellant resisted the
    respondents’ motions and brought its own cross-motion for summary judgment to
    determine the timeliness of the action.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Motion Judge’s findings </span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge dismissed the respondents’ summary
    judgment motions based on the record before him. He found the limitation issue
    to be a triable issue that could not be determined on summary judgment. He then
    adjourned the appellant’s summary judgment motion pending cross-examinations or
    a mini-trial. In dismissing the respondents’ motions, he came to the following
    conclusions:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I cannot find that the plaintiff knew all of
    the facts and was attempting to extend the limitation period by relying on an
    expert report. Rather, the documents are consistent with the affidavit evidence
    that, prior to the May 21 report, the plaintiff was unable to determine what
    had occurred at the bottom of the various walls. As can be seen from the
    highlighted sections of the documents, the information to that point was
    uncertain. The fact that those observations confirmed what was already
    suspected does not move the limitation period backwards. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The documents support that the plaintiff had
    hired an independent witness to, literally and figuratively, get to the bottom
    of the cause. Until the debris from the collapse was removed, the walls were
    observed, and the report was provided, the time could not begin to run. Until
    then, it appears that the cause could not be confirmed. The short period of
    time between the collapse and the report was reasonable in the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following the cross-examinations, the motion
    judge returned to consider whether he could now decide the limitation issue on
    the appellant’s motion. He found that he could, and that the additional evidence
    changed his mind about whether the Dunks knew the cause of the collapse before
    they received the May 21 Brown report. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Gordon Dunk testified that one side of the barn
    collapsed first, and then the walls fell like dominos, which indicated that the
    raceway wall between the empty raceway and the full one on one side had
    collapsed causing the full collapse of the barn. Floyd Dunk agreed that it was
    “probably obvious” that the cause of the collapse was the lack of lateral
    supports, but he had no proof. In a statement he gave to the insurance adjuster
    on May 13, his opinion was that “[h]ad the configuration of the walls been
    different this collapse would not have occurred.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge rejected the position that the
    principals of the appellant were speculating about the cause of the barn
    collapse. He found that either they were not telling the truth now, or they
    ought to have known the cause at the time. They were experienced in the building
    of “exactly this kind of barn.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Also, the barn was of simple construction, the collapse was not a complicated
    process, and the principals observed what occurred. Although they called it
    theories or speculation, “they certainly had all the information they needed to
    found their cause of action”, “the ‘what,’ the ‘who’ and the ‘how’ behind this
    claim.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge concluded that the directing
    minds of the appellant either ought to have known or did know the necessary
    facts by May 12, when they met with the insurance adjuster to discuss the
    situation. He also found that the May 21 Brown report contained no new
    information that the Dunks did not already know. Finally, he observed that
    while much time was spent on the knowledge of the appellant’s counsel, what the
    lawyer knew and when he knew it were not determinative; it is the knowledge of
    the appellant that is. The motion judge’s conclusion was that, by May 12, 2014,
    the appellant knew: </span></p>

    caused by the negligence or breach of contract of the respondents. It then
    pleaded nine specific failures by the respondent HFH, six specific failures by
    the respondent McNeil, and five specific failures by the respondent Franken. I
    will set out a few examples: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>HFH failed to construct the barn according to
    the design, failed to ensure the raceway walls were appropriately braced, and failed
    to ensure the barn was constructed to safely operate. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>McNeil failed to adequately design the barn,
    designed a manure storage system that it knew or ought to have known was unsafe,
    and failed to adequately inspect the ongoing construction. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Franken failed to construct the concrete
    portions of the barn safely, failed to use proper construction practices, and failed
    to provide adequate lateral bracing for the raceway walls.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant concedes that some of the claims
    it alleges are statute barred because it was clear from the cross-examinations
    that Gordon Dunk knew about the deficient lateral bracing and inadequate design
    of the raceway system days after the collapse. However, the appellant alleges there
    is no evidence that its principals knew about other deficiencies in the design,
    construction, and inspection of the construction by the respondents before
    receiving the May 21 Brown report, and therefore, the claims based on those
    failures by the respondents are not statute barred. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s position is that the report
    identified causal findings for the first time, including an issue with the
    height of the raceway walls, the fact that the concrete floor panels did not
    include any mechanical anchorage to the raceway walls, and that the raceway
    walls failed at their connection to the concrete floor slab. These facts gave
    rise to a number of separate claims by the appellant not tethered to the
    failure to brace the walls. The motion judge did not separately consider
    whether those claims were also statute barred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To summarize, the appellant submits that it
    required the May 21 Brown report in order to discover a number of the acts or
    omissions that each of the respondents committed that caused or contributed to
    the collapse of the barn, and that each of these acts or omissions constitutes
    the basis for a separate claim that requires a separate discoverability
    analysis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This issue was not raised before the motion
    judge. He did not address it in his reasons. The respondents HFH and McNeil
    submit that the court should therefore not entertain the argument on the
    appeal. While the court will not, in most cases, entertain an argument on
    appeal that was not raised at the original hearing, it can do so where the
    record is sufficient and the issue is one of law: <em>Becker v. Toronto (City)</em>,
    2020 ONCA 607, 452 D.L.R. (4th) 679, at paras. 39-40; <em>Svia Homes Limited v.
    Northbridge General Insurance Corporation</em>, 2020 ONCA 684, 7 C.C.L.I. (6th)
    1, at paras. 23-28. In this case, the issue is the proper interpretation and
    application of the Act, and the record below is complete. In these
    circumstances, in my view, it is appropriate to address the issue on this
    appeal.</span></p>

    247, and confirmed most recently by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Grant

    Brunswick <em>Limitation of Actions Act</em>, S.N.B. 2009, c. L-8.5 (the “N.B.
    Act”). In <em>Kaynes</em>, the court explained that while the Act no longer
    refers specifically to a cause of action, instead it sets out universal
    criteria for the commencement of the limitation period in respect of a claim:
    at paras. 50-58. A claim is pursued in a court proceeding to obtain a remedy
    for a loss that the defendant caused the plaintiff to suffer by its act or
    omission. To obtain a remedy in a court proceeding, a person must assert a
    cause of action. </span></p>

    the argument that there was a meaningful distinction between “claim” and “cause
    of action” in the context of the N.B. Act (which is similar but not identical
    to the Ontario Act), stating at para. 37:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I recognize that the distinction between
    “claim” and “cause of action” could be meaningful in some circumstances; but in
    my view, it is not so here. In fact, the <i>LAA</i>’s own wording<i>&nbsp;</i>shows
    that the use of “claim” does not rule out a shared meaning with “cause of
    action”. Section 1(1) defines a claim as a “claim to remedy the injury, loss or
    damage that occurred as a result of an act or omission”. In short, s. 1(1)
    indicates that the legislature’s use of the term “claim” focuses on a set of
    facts giving rise to a remedy, which is the same meaning that Grant Thornton attributes
    to the term “cause of action”.</span></p>

    proceeding, one can have a claim for the same remedy based on one or more acts
    or omissions that may have caused the loss. In pleading parlance, different

    as defined, is for the remedy itself – in this case, damages for negligence and
    breach of contract.</span></p>

    whether a plaintiff with a negligence claim must have discovered every
    constituent element of that claim, including knowledge of a duty of care and a
    breach of the standard of care, before the limitation period would begin to run.
    In rejecting that position, Moldaver J. articulated the test for the degree of
    knowledge required under the N.B. Act to trigger the commencement of the
    limitation period, at para. 42:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[A] claim is discovered when a plaintiff has

    Of course, one will not know for certain if a defendant is liable for a loss until
    the verdict is delivered following a trial or summary judgment motion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue that the appellant raises here is:
    what is the significance of the “act or omission” that is referred to in ss. 5(1)(a)(ii)
    and (iii) of the Act? Is the appellant correct that a separate limitation
    period begins to run in respect of each act or omission committed by the
    defendant as part of its negligent conduct contributing to the loss, thereby
    requiring a separate discoverability analysis for each such act or omission? Or
    does the plaintiff only have to know that the defendant’s involvement in the
    loss means that it must have committed one or more negligent acts or omissions
    that caused or contributed to the loss?</span></p>

    omission by the defendant that caused the loss in order to start the limitation
    period running. What it needs to know is that an incident occurred that
    resulted in a loss (s. 5(1)(a)(i)), that the defendant did or failed to do something
    to cause that loss (s. 5(1)(a)(ii) and (iii)), and that, having regard to the
    nature of the injury, loss, or damage, a court proceeding is an appropriate
    means to seek a remedy (s. 5(1)(a)(iv)).</span></p>

    provide an instructive example. The defendant’s car slams into the plaintiff’s
    car. The plaintiff knows the defendant was driving, but may not know whether
    the defendant fell asleep at the wheel, neglected to get the brakes of the car
    serviced, was distracted by a phone call, was drunk, or was just careless. The
    plaintiff will plead all of those allegations as part of its negligence claim. In
    discovery, the true facts will likely be disclosed. It is also possible that
    the actual cause or causes of the accident may not be revealed until trial. But
    the action must be commenced within two years of when the plaintiff knows or
    ought to know that the defendant committed some act or omission that caused the
    loss or damage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>And what is meant by “knows” is that the
    plaintiff has the evidentiary basis to believe that the defendant did an act or
    made an omission that caused a loss for which a court proceeding is appropriate
    to obtain a remedy – the basis of a plausible inference of liability, in the
    words of Moldaver J. Of course, at trial, it may turn out that the defendant was
    not responsible for the loss, either because they owed no duty of care, they
    met the standard of care, or they did not commit the act or omission that was
    alleged. </span></p>

    apparent from the circumstances of the loss and that gives rise to a new claim.
    That is what occurred in <em>Kaynes</em>, where the investor knew early on that
    the company’s financial disclosure was misleading and negligent, and therefore
    had to commence its negligent misrepresentation action. But it only learned
    much later that the company had knowingly and fraudulently made the misleading
    claims, and therefore the investor had more time to allege fraud. </span></p>

    separate acts or omissions come under three categories: faulty design, faulty
    construction, and faulty inspection during construction. The pleading describes
    particulars or details of failures within each of those categories of
    responsibility. The motion judge found, based on the record, that Gordon and Floyd
    Dunk knew shortly after the collapse that the three respondents were
    responsible for these aspects of the development and delivery of the barn, and
    that the barn collapsed because of the failure of one or more of those aspects
    of the planning and erection of the barn. That finding is sufficient to meet
