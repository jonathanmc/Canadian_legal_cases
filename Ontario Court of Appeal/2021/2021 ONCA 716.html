  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on May 6, 2019 by
    Justice E. B. Minden of the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a trial before a judge of the Superior Court of Justice sitting
    without a jury, the appellant was found guilty of sexual assault and sexual
    interference. A conviction was entered on the count of sexual interference. A
    stay on the sexual assault. The trial judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment
    of six and one-half years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Background Facts</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is the biological father of the complainant. For the first
    eight years of the complainant’s life, no real contact between the appellant and
    the complainant occurred despite an agreement that permitted the appellant
    access on weekends.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During a period of about eighteen months after the complainant turned
    eight, the appellant exercised his right of access. In large measure, this meant
    that the complainant spent several weekends at the home in which the appellant
    lived with his wife and daughter. Their home was some distance away from where
    the complainant resided with his mother, the appellant’s former partner.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant gave evidence of three discrete occasions on which he
    was sexually assaulted by the appellant. Two occurred in the appellant’s home
    and the third in the appellant’s truck. The assaults continued until the
    complainant’s tenth birthday when the access visits terminated. The reasons for
    the cessation of the visits varied. The complainant gave evidence that on the
    ride home with the appellant on the weekend of his tenth birthday, he warned
    the appellant that if the abuse did not stop, he would tell somebody about that
    abuse. The appellant claimed that the visits concluded because of the constant
    bickering between the complainant’s mother and himself.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant first disclosed the abuse to a close friend when he was
    in grade nine, then to his girlfriend the summer after he had completed grade
    ten. In 2016, at the suggestion of his close friend to whom he had first
    disclosed, he told his grandmother who relayed what he said to the
    complainant’s mother. The complainant’s mother contacted the police and the
    investigation began, leading to the charges on which the appellant was tried.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Grounds of Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant advances three grounds of appeal. He submits that the trial
    judge erred:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by making impermissible use of the complainant’s prior consistent
    statements to confirm the truth of the complainant’s sworn allegations;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by misapprehending the evidence of the complainant concerning the
    disclosure of his allegation to a high school counsellor; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by applying an uneven standard of scrutiny to the evidence of the
    complainant, on one hand, and the appellant, on the other.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view none of these grounds can prevail.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Prior Consistent Statements</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, prior consistent statements.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the Crown adduced evidence of three separate disclosures by
    the complainant. The sources of this evidence were:</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the complainant himself;</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a close friend and fellow student of the complainant.</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the complainant’s grandmother; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='
line-height:200%'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iv.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the complainant’s former girlfriend, as well as fellow student.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The questions asked and answers given by the complainant, his close friend
    and fellow grade-nine student, and his grandmother were focussed upon the fact
    of and circumstances surrounding the disclosure, not the content of what was
    disclosed. The former girlfriend did not testify. A transcript of her police
    statement was entered on consent as an exhibit at trial. There, she confirmed
    the timing and circumstances of the disclosure and made one brief reference to
    the nature of the conduct alleged, but not the details of where and when it
    occurred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial Crown made it clear in examination of the disclosure witnesses
    that they did not seek any details of the nature of the abuse, only the
    circumstances of the disclosure.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant does not suggest, nor could he, that this disclosure
    evidence was inadmissible at trial. His complaint is that the trial judge made
    improper use of the evidence to confirm the complainant’s account of relevant
    events and, by reason of consistency, enhance the reliability of his evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal fails for essentially three reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his comprehensive reasons for judgment, the trial judge correctly
    articulated the rule governing the admissibility of evidence of prior
    consistent statements, their exceptions, and the limited use, as a trier of
    fact, he could make of that evidence. The trial judge made it clear that the
    statements could not be used to prove the truth of their contents. or to
    enhance the credibility of the complainant or the reliability of his testimony.
    Said differently, the trial judge approached this evidence on the basis of the
    proper legal principles.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons reveals no departure from
    these applicable legal principles. Nothing said or left unsaid by the trial
    judge displays any improper use of this evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, unlike some cases involving disclosure of allegations of sexual
    misconduct, this was not a case in which the details of the disclosure were
    elicited in evidence. In such cases, especially with a lay trier of fact, left
    untutored about limitations on the use of this evidence, the risk of misuse may
    be enhanced. Not so here with a trier of fact schooled in permitted and
    prohibited uses and faithful to precedent.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Misapprehension of Evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second ground of appeal alleges that the trial judge misapprehended
    the complainant’s evidence about whether he disclosed the sexual assault by the
    appellant to a counsellor at school. There were no school records of any such
    disclosure. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the preliminary inquiry, the complainant testified that he had spoken
    to a counsellor at school about being sexually abused. In cross-examination at
    trial, his answer was that he thought he had spoken to a counsellor “for a
    brief little time” at school. Cross-examining counsel then suggested that the
    complainant made no such complaint. The complainant explained: “um, like I said
    I can’t tell you at this point, but I stand by what I said in this - in the
    transcript here, so I would have, yes.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge concluded that the
    complainant provided his then best current memory on the disclosure issue at
    the preliminary inquiry, but that at trial he was no longer certain about the
    issue. The trial judge then went on to say, that even if the complainant did
    speak to a counsellor at school, the absence of such records did not give rise
    to any credibility or reliability concerns.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not satisfied, that read in their entirety, the reasons of the
    trial judge reflect any misapprehension of evidence. At trial, the complainant
    could not recall whether he had told a school counsellor about the abuse. That
    was his memory at trial. He accepted that he had said at the preliminary inquiry
    that he had spoken to a counsellor. But at trial he could not recall one way or
    the other whether he had, in fact, done so. The trial judge’s conclusion on
    this issue involved no misapprehension of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the trial judge went on to determine whether the absence
    of a record of any disclosure to a counsellor, contrary to the complainant’s
    recollection of disclosure at the preliminary inquiry, would have any impact on
    the credibility of the complainant or the reliability of his evidence. The
    trial judge concluded that it had no such effect on his assessment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal fails.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Uneven Scrutiny</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final ground of appeal alleges that the trial judge applied a higher
    or stricter level of scrutiny to the evidence of the defence than he applied to
    the evidence adduced by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this court has frequently pointed out, this is an argument that is
    difficult to advance successfully. It is not established by the simple fact
    that the judge accepted the evidence of some witnesses, but not the testimony
    of others. Or made some findings of fact, but not others. Or could have made
    different findings of fact or drawn different inferences. It is often, as here,
    little more than a thinly veiled attempt to relitigate factual determinations
    made at trial in the absence of any errors in principle, palpable and
    overriding errors in findings of fact, or misapprehensions of evidence. The thorough
    reasons of the trial judge afford no basis for any claim of uneven scrutiny.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument, the appellant alleged that the trial judge erred in
    characterizing the appellant’s testimony in the following terms: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>For much of his testimony I found
    S.F. to be a scripted, stubborn, intransigent and unimpressive witness. At
    times he was careless, if not reckless, with the truth. It seemed to me, that
    he repeatedly attempted to act as an advocate in his own cause rather than as a
    witness sincerely trying to be accurate and honest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant specifically objects to the trial judge’s reference to him
    as behaving in the witness stand as an “advocate in his own cause”. It is the
    obligation of a trial judge to consider, among other things, the manner in
    which witnesses, including the accused, give their evidence. We read the
    reasons of the trial judge as indicating that he viewed the appellant as more
    interested in advancing his own position than answering the questions put
    accurately and honestly. There is nothing wrong with what the trial judge said. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
