  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a<span lang=EN-US> judge alone trial, the appellant was
    convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. He
    appeals against conviction.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant and the appellant are distant
    relatives but were not well acquainted in April 2018 when the events giving
    rise to the charge took place. The complainant was 19 at the time; the
    appellant was 48.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following <span lang=EN-US>several hours of socializing during
    which both consumed alcohol and marijuana, the two went for a drive. After the
    appellant's truck became stuck on a muddy road, the complainant tried to push
    the truck from the mud on her own and lost her shoes in the process. The
    appellant went for help, leaving the complainant on her own in the truck
    without the keys for about 45 minutes to an hour.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <span lang=EN-US>trial judge accepted the complainant's
    evidence that she fell asleep following the appellant's departure and later
    awoke to find him having sexual intercourse with her. Further, the trial judge
    rejected the appellant's evidence that he first performed oral sex on the
    complainant's implicit invitation before engaging in sexual intercourse with
    her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Among other things, the trial judge found as a
    fact that, on the morning following the events, the appellant’s initial
    interaction with a cousin amounted to an admission of having committed a sexual
    assault. In the trial judge's view, the appellant subsequently modified his
    position to being an acknowledgment that consensual sex should not have
    occurred in all the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In any event, <span lang=EN-US>the trial judge was satisfied that
    the complainant fell asleep as a result of drinking and consuming drugs while
    the appellant went for help. Accordingly, the complainant was not capable of
    consenting to sexual intercourse.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, <span lang=EN-US>even on the appellant's own version of events,
    the trial judge was satisfied that the complainant said nothing that would
    constitute consent to intercourse following oral sex.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge was satisfied that even on his own version of
    events, the appellant did not have an honest but mistaken belief in consent as
    he had not taken reasonable steps to ascertain that the complainant was
    consenting taking account of the following factors:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-US>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the <span lang=EN-US>complainant had been drinking and smoking
    pot over several hours;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-US>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the <span lang=EN-US>complainant's behaviour, in trying to push
    the truck out of the mud on her own was bizarre; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>neither had previously expressed any sexual interest in the other.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>the trial judge's view, on
    the appellant's own evidence, the appellant was reckless or wilfully blind to
    the lack of consent.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The appellant’s position on appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On <span lang=EN-US>appeal, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge misapprehended the evidence concerning the appellant’s after-the-fact
    conduct; failed to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable
    doubt in accordance with </span><em>W.(D.)</em><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=EN-US>; and
    failed to properly consider the reasonable possibility arising from the
    circumstantial evidence that the sexual contact had been consensual.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Discussion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We <span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>do not accept these
    submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    misapprehension of evidence issue</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>complainant's cousin gave
    evidence that included the following. On the morning after these events, the
    appellant had a concerning look on his face and asked to speak to her. He just
    started saying, “I fucked up. I fucked up. I fucked up. Can you find it in your
    heart to forgive me?” The appellant appeared hysterical and started talking
    about himself and the complainant. After he calmed down, the appellant said he
    had sex with the complainant because she asked him to keep her occupied.
    However, he said was taken aback when, afterwards, the complainant was upset.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <span lang=EN-US>our view, it was open to the trial judge, on
    the basis of this evidence, to conclude that the appellant's initial statements
    to the complainant's cousin amounted to an acknowledgment of having committed a
    sexual assault and that the appellant modified this acknowledgment as time went
    along. It was the trial judge’s function, as the trier of fact, to determine
    what, if any, significance should be attributed to this evidence. Given the
    witness’s description of the appellant’s statements and demeanour, we see
    nothing unreasonable about the trial judge’s conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,<span style='line-height:100%'> <span lang=EN-US>we are not
    satisfied that the trial judge misunderstood the evidence concerning whether
    the complainant complained to her grandmother prior to this discussion. The
    trial judge gave his reasons orally the day after the evidence and submissions
    were completed. Although in his initial summary of his assessment of the
    evidence, the trial judge said the complainant complained to her grandmother
    immediately upon arriving back at her grandmother’s residence, the trial judge
    later clarified when reviewing the evidence that the complainant disclosed the
    events after she had had a rest.</span></span><span lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, <span lang=EN-US>even assuming the trial judge’s
    reference to an &quot;official complaint&quot; means he thought the appellant
    spoke to the complainant's cousin after the complainant complained to her
    grandmother, we reject the appellant's submission that this somehow taints the
    trial judge’s finding that the appellant made an admission of guilt. The trial
    judge made his finding based on what was said, not based on the timing of the
    events. The appellant's submissions about the complainant's cousin's subsequent
    text to the complainant giving rise to a motive to fabricate were not raised at
    trial. In any event, the text did not refer to the appellant's statements about
    he and the complainant having sex.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>W.(D.)</em> issue and the circumstantial evidence issue</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span lang=EN-US>our view, the appellant's submissions about the
    manner in which the trial judge weighed the evidence and the inferences arising
    from the circumstantial evidence are nothing more than a request that we retry
    the case. That is not our function.</span></p>
