  <p align=center style='
text-align:center'>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a trial in the Ontario Court of Justice, the applicant was
    convicted of sexual assault (<em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s.
    271), uttering death threats (s. 264.1), and breaching a release order (s.
    145). He was sentenced to three and a half years’ imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant seeks bail pending appeal. For the following reasons, the
    application is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant was found guilty of sexually assaulting his former
    intimate partner. Although they had broken off their relationship, they
    remained in contact. They shared the same bed when the offences took place. The
    victim said that she awoke to find the appellant penetrating her vagina. The
    appellant then moved himself towards the victim’s face and ejaculated in her
    mouth.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next day, the victim was on the phone with a male friend. The
    applicant was angry because a bail condition prohibited him from having a
    phone. When the victim said, “It’s not my fault … that you’re not allowed a
    phone”, he became angry and started punching himself in the temple area. He
    told the victim that he would tie up his mother and step-father and slit their
    throats; he also said he would slit the victim’s throat. At the time, the
    applicant was on bail while awaiting trial on charges of uttering threats,
    distributing intimate messages, and criminal harassment.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Applicant</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant is 38 years old. He has an extensive criminal record.
    Excluding the offences for which he now seeks bail, the applicant has approximately
    40 convictions, including entries for sexual assault (x 1), uttering threats (x
    3), and criminal harassment (x 2). Most notably for bail purposes, he has 19
    convictions for breaching various types of court orders – release orders,
    probation orders, and a conditional sentence order.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Release Plan</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant proposes a single surety – his new intimate partner. They
    have been together for over two years. The proposed surety is aware of the
    applicant’s most recent convictions. Although she was not his surety with
    respect to these offences, she swears that the applicant abided by all of his
    bail conditions when they were together. She also said: “I have no concerns
    that if this court sees fit to release him, he will comply with all conditions
    imposed upon his release this time. I will be there to support him and to
    ensure that he complies with his conditions.”</p>
  <p class=Heading>Grounds of Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant submits that the trial judge erred by admitting a
    statement the appellant gave to the police. The trial judge rejected the
    submission that the police breached the applicant’s rights under s. 10(b) of
    the <em>Charter</em> by denying him access to his counsel of choice. He submits
    that he should not have been forced into consulting with duty counsel when he
    had his own lawyer. The police should have allowed him more time to consult his
    counsel of choice.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Discussion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The criteria for bail pending appeal of a
    conviction are set out in s. 679(3) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
lang=EN-GB>. An applicant must establish that: (a) the appeal is not frivolous;
    (b) he will surrender into custody in accordance with the terms of any bail
    order; and (c) detention is not necessary “in the public interest.”</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-GB>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Not Frivolous (s. 679(3)(a))</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>In </span><em>R. v. Oland</em><span lang=EN-GB>, 2017
    SCC 17, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 250, at para. 20, Moldaver J. said that the “not
    frivolous” test “is widely recognized as being a very low bar.” The Crown does
    not assert that the proposed ground of appeal is frivolous; instead, he submits
    that it is weak and, in any event, overcome by enforceability considerations in
    the public interest equation (s. 679(3)(c)). I agree that the appeal is not
    frivolous.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-GB>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Surrender into Custody (s. 679(3)(b))</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the applicant’s many breaches of court orders, absconding does not appear to be
    a problem. The Crown does not submit otherwise. The applicant has met his onus
    on this criterion.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Public Interest (s. 679(3)(c))</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two components to public interest branch under s. 679(3)(c) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> – public safety and public confidence in the administration of
    justice. This bail application fails on public safety considerations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted already, the applicant’s criminal record is extensive. The applicant has convictions
    for sexual assault and criminal harassment in relation to former intimate
    partners. This must be seen in the light of his track record for breaching
    court orders of various kinds. This is an important factor in gauging how the
    applicant can be expected to perform if released on bail pending appeal: see <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;S.H.</em>,
    2020 ONSC 4041, at para. 33. So too is the fact that the applicant was on bail
    when he committed the sexual assault in this case: see <em>R. v. Le</em>, 2006
    MBCA 68, 240 C.C.C. (3d) 130, at paras. 34-35.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Set
    against the applicant’s criminal history is the evidence of his proposed
    surety, being his new intimate partner. She observed no breaches during his
    time on bail, a factor that weighs in the applicant’s favour on this ground: <em>R.
    v. Walters</em>, 2020 ONCA 825, at para. 11.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the proposed surety has not witnessed any compliance problems, she was not his
    surety at the time. Like many good people willing to assume the important role
    of a surety, she has no track record in actually supervising the applicant. Her
    chances of success are considerably weakened by the applicant’s proven
    unwillingness or inability to comply with court orders.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    all of the circumstances, the applicant has failed to discharge his onus on
    this aspect of s. 679(3)(c). Given my finding on the public safety component of
    this ground, it is not strictly necessary to address public confidence
    considerations. However, I make the following observations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded that reviewability interests ought to trump enforceability
    considerations in this case. The offence was serious. The trial judge’s
    thorough reasons for judgment demonstrate that, although there were
    inconsistencies between the applicant’s statement and his testimony, there were
    significant internal testimonial inconsistencies. The prospect of overturning
    his conviction on this basis seems doubtful.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the applicant could establish a favourable balance between reviewability and
    enforceability considerations under s. 679(3)(c), this is one of those cases
    where “residual public safety concerns” prevent release: <em>Oland</em>, at
    para. 27.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Conclusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application is dismissed.</p>
