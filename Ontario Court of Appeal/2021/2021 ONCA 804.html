  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence
    when he concluded that the appellant had sexually assaulted the complainant
    when she was between 11 and 13 years old, between 1995 and 1999. We are not
    persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence and dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that she first met the appellant when she was
    in grade six, in the fall of 1995, when he was dating her mother. In the years
    that followed, the complainant and her mother lived at three different
    addresses. The appellant moved in with the complainant’s family at the second
    of those addresses and continued living with them at the third address. The
    complainant was an adult at the time of trial and was testifying to events that
    had occurred 22 years earlier, when she was a child. She said the assaults
    occurred before the appellant moved in with them and continued until he moved
    out of the third address. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were problems in her evidence as to the timing and the place of
    the assaults. For example, she testified that the assaults first began at the
    appellant’s home on Navy Street, but the appellant did not move into that home
    until 1997, after he broke up with the complainant’s mother. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge noted that a “crucial point of evidence for the Crown
    and the defence” is that the appellant has the words “fuck you” inscribed on
    his penis. The complainant testified that she saw those words and that tattoo
    every time she saw the appellant nude, and that she saw him nude many times
    over several years that the assaults continued. The trial judge accepted that
    the appellant acquired the tattoo after he broke up with the complainant’s
    mother and moved out of her home in August 1996. The complainant also testified
    that the abuse stopped after he moved out. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence by
    concluding that the abuse must have continued after he moved out of the home,
    when there was no evidence that the assaults continued after that point. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the complainant was mistaken about the
    precise location and times when the assaults occurred but was convinced that
    invasive sexual assaults described by her had in fact occurred. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He observed,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>But this is one of those occasions
    when I have to consider that [the complainant], an adult woman, is testifying
    with the memories and the observations essentially of an 11- and 12-year-old
    girl. The tattoo would be very startling and very unusual, and certainly very
    memorable. It would not surprise me if 22 years later the fact of the tattoo is
    more memorable than when it was acquired. I find that her recollection that the
    tattoo was always there is an inconsistency with the evidence but does not in
    my view undermine [the complainant’s] credibility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was convinced that the complainant had accurately
    described the ongoing course of numerous repeated sexual assaults in their
    essential nature. Her evidence about the conduct she ascribed to the appellant
    was detailed and persuasive. There was no suggestion that she was deliberately
    fabricating the allegations. The issue was the reliability of her evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was alive to the inconsistencies the defence argued made
    the complainant’s evidence unreliable. It was open to the trial judge to
    reconcile those differences by accepting some parts of the complainant’s
    evidence and rejecting other parts. The trial judge noted that her memory was
    unreliable as to “where the events happened but not about what happened.” The
    trial judge implicitly came to the same conclusion about when the assaults
    occurred. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    inferences were reasonably available to the trial judge. There was no
    misapprehension of the evidence, and the appeal is accordingly dismissed. </p>
