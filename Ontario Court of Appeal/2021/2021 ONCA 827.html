lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of several sexual
    offences. At his trial, the appellant testified. During his testimony, the Crown
    proposed to ask him questions about prior sexual activity. Defence counsel
    objected. The Crown suggested that the appellant should be excluded from the
    courtroom while the objection was being discussed. The trial judge agreed.
    Defence counsel did not object. The trial judge ordered the appellant to leave
    the courtroom. After very brief submissions (probably a minute at most), the
    trial judge made a brief ruling (one paragraph) prohibiting the proposed line of
    questions. The trial continued. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties agree that the exclusion of the
    appellant during a portion of his trial was a clear violation of s. 650(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> which provides, in relevant parts, “an accused … shall
    be present in court during the whole of his or her trial.”</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent Crown seeks to save the
    conviction on the basis of the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. The appellant resists this argument on the merits. In the
    alternative, the appellant contends that this should not be considered under
    the proviso rubric; rather, relying on a fairly recent decision of the New
    Brunswick Court of Appeal, the appellant contends that the proper analytical
    framework for this and similar cases should be a combination of sections 7, 11(d)
    and 24(1) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  </span></p>

    sexual assault, sexual interference, and invitation to sexual touching. The
    appellant was in high school at the time of the alleged incidents and was
    around 16 or 17 years old. The complainant was about 10 to 12 years old at the same
    time. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant’s testimony at trial was that the
    appellant told him about a “game of truth or dare” that he played with some of
    his teenage friends. The appellant used this game as a basis for suggesting to
    the complainant that they engage in various sexual activities. According to the
    complainant, sexual activities included the complainant stroking the appellant’s
    erect penis and putting his mouth on it. The complainant also testified that
    the appellant would perform oral sex on him. These activities took place in
    several locations throughout the house, including a living room chair, the
    basement, a bathtub, and the complainant's bedroom. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified that the appellant was
    never violent or abusive; he was simply a nice and pleasant guy. The
    complainant felt he had no choice but to participate. Aside from mentioning one
    incident to the appellant’s brother, the complainant did not tell anyone about
    the sexual incidents until 21 years later. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified at trial. He strongly
    denied all of the complainant’s allegations. During his cross-examination, the
    Crown introduced the topic of the appellant’s prior sexual history when he was a
    younger teenager and even pre-teen. This led to an objection by defence
    counsel, a request by the Crown, and a ruling by the trial judge. All of this
    took place in about two or three minutes and is recorded in two pages of trial
    transcript, which I set out as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q.      Were you ever sexually active with
    her? [a previous elementary school girlfriend]</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A.      I mean, we were very young so to say
    sexually active, I mean, we kissed, we held hands. Very light petting.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q.      What's – what is &quot;petting&quot;
    mean?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Defence counsel]:          I don't know – I
    don't know how relevant all of this is, Your Honour; where my... </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>THE COURT:        [Crown]?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Defence counsel]:          ...friend is going
    with this.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Crown]:       It's – well, perhaps we can ask
    the witness to step out.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>THE COURT:        All right.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Defence counsel]:          Well, these.....</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>THE COURT:        [D.Q.], perhaps you can just
    step outside the courtroom. Don’t go far away.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A.      Okay.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>THE COURT:        We'll have a discussion and
    we'll get you back in.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>...WITNESS IS EXCUSED</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Crown]:       Your Honour, I think [D.Q.]’s
    sexual history, particularly as a young child, a teen, preteen, a teenager, is
    relevant to whether or not he would be sexually active at 17 – at 18 years old,
    for instance, when these allegations were made. So I just want to know if he is
    – was sexually active throughout his younger years. The allegations are that he
    was having oral sex and masturbating the complainant. I think it's relevant to
    know when he became sexual active. And if he was, when he was babysitting or
    during the time period he was babysitting the – the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Defence counsel]:          Does my friend
    suggest if he was an active sexual teenage boy, that he's more likely to have
    sexually assaulted a young boy?        I mean, that – there's no connection to
    that. I mean, if he's a teenager where he's sexually active, does that make him
    more likely to have committed this offence? There's no correlation, in my
    respectful submission.</span></p>

    or 17, has said that he had a relationship most of his high school years and
    prior to that had another relationship during elementary school. When he became
    sexual active, it seems to me, is of very minimal, if any, relevance to this inquiry.
    It would not be surprising that any 16 or 17 year old boy in high school with a
    relationship with another individual is engaged in some form of sexual
    activity. I'm not suggesting intimate sexual activity. That's just the way it goes.
    And I think I can take judicial notice of that. When or whether that
    relationship existed with another person in elementary school, I think has no
    bearing on this inquiry.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> (1982), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 510 (Ont. C.A.), a case involving a trial
    judge interviewing, without the accused being present, two jurors about two
    anonymous telephone calls one of them had received the day before. Martin J.A.
    eloquently described the underlying rationale for s. 577, the predecessor
    section to the present s. 650 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at para. 81:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The essential reason the accused is entitled
    to be present at his trial is that he may hear the case made out against him,
    and, having heard it, have the opportunity of answering it. … The right of the
    accused to be present at his trial, however, also gives effect to another
    principle. Fairness and openness are fundamental values in our criminal justice
    system. The presence of the accused at all stages of his trial affords him the opportunity
    of acquiring first-hand knowledge of the proceedings leading to the eventual
    result of the trial. The denial of that opportunity to an accused may well
    leave him with a justifiable sense of injustice.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is important for the accused to see and
    hear the entire process by which he or she is tried so that he or she sees that
    the trial is fair. … The public perception of the fairness of the trial process

lang=EN-CA>, 2010 ONCA 754, in a second degree murder trial, the trial judge
    discussed his proposed jury instructions in chambers with counsel but without

lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Watt J.A. determined that the chambers
    discussion was part of the trial; he said, at para. 109:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>To determine whether something that happened
    in the course of a trial was part of the “trial” for the purposes of s. 650(1)
    requires an examination of whether what occurred affected the “vital interests”
    of the accused.&nbsp;No one can gainsay that what was discussed here, the
    contents of final jury instructions, affected the vital interests of the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Turning to the potential application of the
    proviso, Watt J.A. said, at paras. 118-19:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Where something takes place in the absence of
    the accused that is part of the “trial” for s. 650(1) purposes, it does not
    inevitably follow that a new trial must be ordered if the accused is
    convicted.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Section 686(1)(b)(iv) of the&nbsp;<em>Criminal
    Code</em>&nbsp;came into force on December 4, 1985. Its real focus seems to
    have been to inter the jurisprudence that regarded procedural errors that
    caused trial courts to lose jurisdiction as incurable, even on appeal:&nbsp;<em>R.
    v. Khan</em>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 12. Its embrace includes but is not
    limited to the procedural irregularity caused by the absence of the accused
    during his or her trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Watt J.A. continued by articulating a test that
    could be applied when considering whether the proviso should be applied in a
    case where s. 650 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> has been breached. He said, at para. 123:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>To determine whether a breach of s. 650(1) may
    be salvaged by the application of the proviso in s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iv) requires
    a consideration of all the circumstances surrounding the violation. Relevant
    factors may include, but are not limited to: (i) the nature and extent of the
    exclusion, including whether it was inadvertent or deliberate; (ii) the role or
    position of the defence counsel in initiating or concurring in the exclusion;
    (iii) whether any subjects discussed during the exclusion were repeated on the
    record or otherwise reported to the accused; (iv) whether any discussions in
    the accused’s absence were preliminary in nature or involved decisions about
    procedural, evidentiary or substantive matters; (v) the effect, if any, of the
    discussions on the apparent fairness of trial proceedings; and (vi) the effect,
    if any, of the discussions on decisions about the conduct of the defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the second Ontario case</span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>, R. v. E. (F.E.)</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2011 ONCA 783, the
    accused was excluded during the entire pre-jury charge conference in the trial
    judge’s chambers. He was also excluded during a brief period (about nine
    minutes) regarding discussions about a potential question being put to him
    during cross-examination.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the broader issue, Watt J.A. spoke bluntly
    and ordered a new trial. He said, at para. 52:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Final instructions to a jury in a criminal
    case are of the utmost importance to the person whose liberty is at stake.
    Those instructions explain the basis upon which the accused’s liability will be
    decided and his or her defence assessed.&nbsp;An accused is entitled to hear
    why some instructions are included and others are omitted from the charge –
    first-hand, the complete version and not a synopsis after the fact. The
    exclusion of an accused from the entire pre-charge conference undermines both
    the appearance and the reality of the due administration of justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the narrower issue, which is very similar to
    the issue on this appeal, the court reached a different conclusion. Watt J.A.
    said, at para. 44:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>What happened here was that the intentional
    and understandable exclusion of a witness resulted in the exclusion of the
    appellant and a breach of s. 650(1) of the&nbsp;</span><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-style:normal'>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. This
    should not have occurred.&nbsp;An accused has the right to be present
    throughout the entirety of his or her trial, including during discussions
    pertaining to cross-examination.&nbsp;Nonetheless, in the circumstances of this
    case as I have described them, if this nine-minute exclusion stood alone, I
    would apply s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iv) to the procedural irregularity and preserve
    the finding of guilt on the ground that the appellant suffered no prejudice
    from it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the third Ontario case, </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. D.B.</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2012 ONCA 301, as in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>E. (F.E.) </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>the accused was excluded from
    the courtroom during his cross-examination by the Crown while counsel made
    submissions about certain questions the Crown proposed to put to him. The trial
    judge permitted some of the questions to be asked. Later, the Crown brought the
    improper exclusion of the accused to the attention of the court. Defence counsel
    did not seek a mistrial or any other remedy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, the Crown conceded that the accused
    should not have been asked to leave the courtroom. However, the court applied
    the proviso. Doherty J.A. said, at para. 17, that the questions asked after the
    accused returned to the stand were “inconsequential to the result of the trial”.
    He applied </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>E. (F.E.)</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> and concluded, at para. 19, that “the appellant was not in any way prejudiced
    by his relatively brief absence from the courtroom during the trial.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Against this backdrop of relevant case law over
    an extended period, I turn to the application of the governing principles to
    the facts of this case. In my view, the best path forward is to apply the six
    factors identified by Watt J.A. in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Simon</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first factor – whether the exclusion of the
    accused was inadvertent or deliberate – favours the Crown. The exclusion was
    surely inadvertent in the sense that all three of the trial judge, Crown
    counsel and defence counsel simply forgot about s. 650 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. If any one of them had
    remembered s. 650, the exclusion of the appellant would not have happened. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second factor favours the Crown. Defence
    counsel did not object to the brief exclusion of his client during his
    cross-examination. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The third factor favours the appellant. It
    appears that when he returned to the stand after his brief departure, nothing
    about the subject discussed during his absence was put on the record or reported
    to him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fourth factor favours the appellant. The
    discussion in the absence of the accused related to an evidentiary matter –
    namely, would the Crown be allowed to ask him questions about possible sexual
    activity in his elementary school years.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fifth factor overwhelmingly favours the
    Crown. The accused was out of the courtroom for about two minutes. The trial
    judge’s ruling was 100 percent in his favour; the Crown was prohibited from
    asking questions of the accused in the category he proposed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sixth factor also strongly favours the
    Crown. The very brief discussion in the courtroom in the absence of the accused
    and the trial judge’s ruling entirely in his favour had no effect on the
    conduct of the defence. Indeed, the trial judge’s ruling helped the defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Stepping back and considering these factors
    together, I conclude that they strongly support application of the proviso in
    this case. In the words of the sports community, “No harm, no foul”. Or, as
    expressed more elegantly by Hall J.A. in a leading case dealing with the
    proviso in British Columbia, </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Bagadiong</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, 2013 BCCA 538, at para. 40: “a refusal to apply the curative
    provision in the present case would be a triumph of form over substance.”</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> is well-established and appropriate. For more than 30 years, courts
    from across the country, including the Supreme Court of Canada, this court, and
    other appellate courts, have considered the issue of a breach of s. 650 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> under the rubric of the
    proviso in s. 686 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Code</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>: see </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA>Barrow </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>(1987), </span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Simon </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>(2010), </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA>E. (F.E.)</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-style:normal'> (2011), </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA>D.B. </span></em><em><span

lang=EN-CA>Bagadiong </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>(2013)</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. Resort to the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> is, therefore, not necessary to fashion a remedy in appropriate
    cases.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, I observe that in the only case that
    applies a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>ss.
    7, 11(d) and 24(1) analysis, </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Dedam</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, the language used to lead to a s. 24(1) result was anchored in
    observations such as: “The egregious nature of some of the incidents where Mr.
    Dedam was excluded … raises the violations of s. 650(1) to the level of </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> breaches”; “Dedam’s repeated
    exclusions in the circumstances described above were egregious”. Obviously,
    there was nothing egregious about the single brief mistake that was made during
    the appellant’s trial. Accordingly, it is not necessary to consider what might constitute
    a s. 7 or 11(d) breach and a s. 24(1) remedy in a different case. </span></p>
