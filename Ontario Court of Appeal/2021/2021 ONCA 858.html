    from the conviction entered on September 28, 2017, and the sentence imposed on February
    20, 2018 by Justice Ian F. Leach of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with
    a jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of human trafficking, procuring, and
    receiving a material benefit from someone under 18. He received a global
    sentence of six years. He appeals the convictions, alleging that the judge’s
    charge to the jury was unfair and was in error with respect to the instructions
    on each count. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Brief background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown alleged that the appellant recruited the complainant, a
    15-year-old homeless girl who was addicted to crystal meth, to engage in sex
    work for his profit. The Crown relied on a series of messages between the
    appellant and the complainant’s boyfriend which discussed making money from the
    complainant’s sex work. In these messages, the appellant came up with a fee
    structure and discussed his “cut”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant brought the complainant to a hotel room where two other
    men (the co-accused at trial) were present. The appellant told her that
    performing sex acts was the only way she could get more drugs for her
    addiction. One of the men was known by the appellant to be a pimp. When the
    appellant left the hotel room, the other two men refused to let her leave, sexually
    assaulted her, and trafficked her for sex. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified at trial. The appellant did not testify and
    called no evidence. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The jury charge</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the jury charge was both unfair and wrong in
    law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The unfairness arose, according to the appellant, because the trial
    judge editorialized the evidence, did not adequately explain the appellant’s defence,
    made references to there being “no evidence” to contradict portions of the
    Crown’s case, and did not emphasize the inconsistencies in the complainant’s
    evidence. The appellant submits that, in the result, there was a burden on him
    to provide evidence in violation of the presumption of innocence, and that the
    jury must have been aware that the trial judge viewed the appellant as guilty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial was not unfair, and the burden of proof was not reversed. The
    trial judge gave multiple instructions: (i) confirming that the jurors were the
    judges of fact and when he spoke about the evidence, they were free to
    disagree; and (ii) that the burden of proof was on the Crown and that never
    changed. The trial judge also gave an extensive review of the inconsistencies
    in the complainant’s evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant further submits that the trial judge made legal errors
    with respect to each count. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Human trafficking</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant sections of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46</span></em> provide:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>279.011
    (1)&nbsp;Every person who recruits, transports, transfers, receives, holds,
    conceals or harbours a person under the age of eighteen years, or exercises
    control, direction or influence over the movements of a person under the age of
    eighteen years, <span class=Underline>for the purpose of exploiting</span> <u>them
    or facilitating their exploitation</u> is guilty of an indictable offence… [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>279.04(1)
    For the purpose of sections 279.01 to 279.03, a person exploits another person
    if they cause them to provide, or offer to provide, labour or a service by
    engaging in conduct that, in all the circumstances, could reasonably be
    expected to cause the other person to believe that their safety or the safety
    of another person known to them would be threatened if they failed to provide, or
    offer to provide, the labour or service. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the judge erred in relation to “the purpose” element of
    the section. The appellant submits that the judge erred by instructing the jury
    that the actual exploitation of the complainant (which was not in dispute)
    could lead the jury to infer that the appellant intended to exploit her. In
    other words, the trial judge concentrated on the <em><span lang=EN-CA>actus
    reus</span></em> and ignored the <em><span lang=EN-CA>mens rea</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>.</span> The appellant says that there was no evidence of his state
    of mind in relation to the exploitation. In particular, he submits that there
    was no evidence that he was aware of what was happening in the hotel room when
    he was not there, and that he did not witness the coercive conduct of the other
    two men. Consequently, it was wrong for the jury to infer that his purpose was
    to exploit or facilitate the exploitation of the complainant because there was
    insufficient evidence of knowledge on his part. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this submission. The trial judge referred the jury to the communications
    before the appellant brought the complainant to the hotel room. The evidence also
    included that the appellant left the complainant to work for a known pimp, returned
    to the hotel room after the complainant had been assaulted and trafficked, and again
    left her in the control of the known pimp. It was open to the jury to infer, based
    on the evidence, that the appellant’s actions were for the purpose of exploiting
    the complainant or facilitating her exploitation. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Procuring a person under the age of 18</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span

    Everyone who procures a person under the age of 18 years to offer or provide
    sexual services for consideration or, for the purpose of facilitating an

    person under the age of 18 who offers or provides sexual services for
    consideration, or exercises control, direction or influence over the movements
    of that person, is guilty of an indictable offence…</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court’s decision in <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Gallone</span></em>,
    2019 ONCA 663, 147 O.R. (3d) 225, at para. 59 provides that there are <span
lang=EN-CA>two modes of committing the&nbsp;<em>actus reus</em>&nbsp;of the
    procuring offence: (i)</span> the<span lang=EN-CA> accused “procures a person
    to offer or provide sexual services for consideration”; or (ii) the accused
    “recruits, holds, conceals or harbours a person who offers or provides sexual

    charged only referred to the first mode, not the second. The trial judge, who
    did not have the benefit of <em>Gallone</em>, went beyond the first mode to

    states required for each, the appellant alleges that the charge included a

    reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the trial judge repeated, at least five
    times, that the fault requirement for procuring is satisfied if the accused
    intentionally caused or induced the person to provide sexual services for
    consideration. The charge also repeated the requirement of intent to procure.
    The jury was clearly instructed on the fault element for the first mode of
    committing the procuring offence.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, there is no prejudice to the appellant. He
    was convicted of human trafficking, the elements of which include the second
    mode of committing the <em>actus reus</em> of the procuring offence. In that
    regard, the trial judge instructed many times that the jury must be satisfied
    that the appellant intentionally recruited, held, concealed, harbored, or
    intentionally exercised control, direction, or influence over the movements of
    the complainant. In the context of the charge as a whole, we are satisfied that
    the trial judge effectively charged the jury on the <em>mens rea</em> for the
    second mode of the procuring offence. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Material benefit from human trafficking</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The <em>Criminal Code</em> provides:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>279.02(2)&nbsp;Everyone
    who receives a financial or other material benefit, knowing that it is obtained
    by or derived directly or indirectly from the commission of an offence under
    subsection 279.011(1), is guilty of an indictable offence…</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the verdict was unreasonable because there was no
    evidence that he received a benefit from the complainant’s sex work. He further
    submits that, if the jury was to rely solely on circumstantial evidence, a <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Villaroman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span>instruction should
    have been given confirming that his guilt was the only reasonable inference:
    see <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Villaroman</span></em>, 2016 SCC 33, [2016]
    S.C.R. 1000. </p>

    to <em>R. v. Fleet</em> (1997), 26 O.R. (3d) 542 (C.A.), </span>and at paras.
    20 and 30 rejects the necessity for any formula of words to be used in the case
    of circumstantial evidence. According to <em><span lang=EN-CA>Fleet</span></em>,
    as cited in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Villaroman</span></em>, at para. 20, the
    object may be achieved by charging the jury:</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>in
    accordance with that language and pointing out to the jury the other inferences
    that the defence says should be drawn from the evidence and the necessity to
    acquit the accused if any of those inferences raises a reasonable doubt; or</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reminded the jury that there was no direct evidence that the
    appellant had received a benefit. When he re-instructed the jury in response to
    a question, he emphasized that the Crown must prove the receipt of a material
    benefit beyond a reasonable doubt. He further said that any reasonable doubt in
    this regard must result in an acquittal.  </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence was clear that the appellant had a financial motive for recruiting the
    complainant. The complainant was given none of the money paid for her services.
    She was given only drugs. The appellant had earlier communicated his cut. It
    was open to the jury to conclude that the appellant received a material
    benefit. </p>
