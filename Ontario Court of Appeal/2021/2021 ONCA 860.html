  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Timothy Massey-Patel, was working
    as a dancer at a male strip club. The complainant, who was attending a
    bachelorette party, hired the appellant for a private dance in a small room in
    the V.I.P. area of the club. Shortly after leaving the V.I.P. area, the
    complainant made allegations that led to a sexual assault charge against the
    appellant. The appellant was tried and convicted on that charge before the
    Ontario Court of Justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the trial the complainant testified that the
    appellant touched her sexually and inserted his finger into her vagina without
    her consent. She also testified that the appellant briefly inserted his penis
    into her vagina, again without her consent. She said that she did not call out
    for help or vocalize her lack of consent to any of this touching because she was
    frozen in shock and felt powerless. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant did not testify. In a police
    statement that was admitted into evidence the appellant initially denied that
    the alleged sexual contact took place. He ultimately admitted to the police
    that he had in fact digitally penetrated the complainant but described her as
    an enthusiastic participant and he gave details of her active participation. He
    denied penetrating the complainant’s vagina with his penis but acknowledged
    that his penis may have been in the general area of the complainant’s vagina. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge did not believe the appellant’s testimony
    about the complainant’s consent and was not left in reasonable doubt by that
    testimony. She believed beyond a reasonable doubt the complainant’s testimony that
    she had not consented to the sexual activity with the appellant. Although she had
    a reasonable doubt about whether the appellant penetrated the complainant with
    his penis, the trial judge found beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual
    touching and digital penetration occurred. Although it was not argued before
    her, the trial judge noted that a belief in consent defence was not available
    to the appellant because he had not taken reasonable steps to confirm that the
    complainant was communicating consent. Accordingly, she found the appellant
    guilty of one count of sexual assault. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals that conviction. At the
    end of the oral argument, we dismissed the appeal for reasons to follow. These
    are our reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The verdict was not unreasonable</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argued that, given her reasonable
    doubt about whether the appellant penetrated the complainant with his penis, it
    was unreasonable for the trial judge to have found the appellant guilty of
    sexually assaulting the complainant by touching and digitally penetrating her
    without consent. The appellant submits that these outcomes are irreconcilable.
    We disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the trial judge’s decision is read as a
    whole, it is clear that her reasonable doubt about whether the appellant
    penetrated the complainant with his penis did not arise from credibility
    concerns about the complainant, whose evidence she believed. Instead, the trial
    judge’s reasonable doubt relating to whether the appellant penetrated the
    complainant with his penis arose from reliability concerns that in no way
    impugned the credibility of the complainant’s testimony. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the trial judge explained, her reasonable
    doubt about the alleged penile penetration arose from “the totality of the
    evidence”. That evidence included testimony by the complainant that she was in
    shock, an admission made by the appellant to the police that his erect penis
    was near her vaginal area, and the complainant’s uncertainty about whether the
    appellant ejaculated. In these circumstances it was reasonable for the trial
    judge to have been left in reasonable doubt by the appellant’s denial that he
    had penetrated the complainant with his penis, while at the same time accepting
    both the appellant’s admission that he had digitally penetrated the complainant
    and the complainant’s testimony that she did not consent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor was it unreasonable for the trial judge to
    have rejected the appellant’s police statement that the complainant was an
    active participant in the sexual contact that occurred. The appellant’s account
    was discredited by the fact that, during the course of that statement, his
    version of events moved from “indignant denial” of sexual contact to admitting
    digital penetration. Quite simply, he lied about the core allegation. Moreover,
    the appellant told the police that when he touches his clients, he stops if
    they say no. The trial judge was entitled to rely on this admission as
    discrediting his account of the conversations he claimed to have had with the
    complainant about her consent. The trial judge was also entitled to find that
    the appellant offered a self-serving and exaggerated account of how visible the
    inside of the booth was to those in the area. Moreover, the trial judge was
    entitled to rely on the complainant’s abrupt departure from the V.I.P. booth,
    and testimony from her and her friends about her distraught condition, as
    supportive of her account.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Simply put, we see no merit in the unreasonable
    verdict appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge did not err in her assessment
    of the evidence of the cashier and the club manager</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge accepted evidence that when she
    left the V.I.P. area the complainant remarked something to the effect of, “what
    was supposed to happen in there”, and that she was distraught as she approached
    her friends. The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in accepting this
    evidence in the face of the testimony of the cashier to the contrary. We
    disagree. There was evidence before the trial judge that the cashier was
    distracted by other patrons, and that the club was noisy. In these
    circumstances, the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the cashier failed
    to hear the statement and was not in a position to observe the complainant’s distraught
    condition described by the complainant and her friends. The trial judge was
    also entitled to find that the cashier did not have a complete memory of
    events, given that his testimony that the complainant did not pay any money
    before leaving the V.I.P. area was contradicted by other witnesses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge was also entitled to reject the
    testimony of the club manager that the complainant did not become upset until
    she failed to pay the required fee, at which point, he said, she decided to
    begin the “waterworks&quot;. The trial judge found the club manager to be
    partial against the complainant, dismissive of her demeanour and her complaint,
    and disinterested in inquiring into what happened. As explained immediately below,
    the trial judge also found that he gave misleading evidence about the limits of
    appropriate conduct within the club. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We are not persuaded that the trial judge erred
    in assessing the evidence of the cashier and the club manager.</span></p>

    engaged in impermissible stereotypical reasoning. None of the inferences drawn by
    the trial judge were inappropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Specifically, the trial judge relied on her
    observations about the sexualized culture of the club in discounting the
    manager’s testimony that the kind of sexual activity complained of would not be
    tolerated. She commented on the “parade” of men in various states of dress and undress
    to explain the complainant’s apparent confusion about how the appellant was
    dressed. And she referred to the complainant’s accurate observation of the
    “copious amounts of condoms within the V.I.P. area” as an illustration of the
    complainant’s capacity to observe matters of detail despite her alcohol
    consumption. Simply put, there is no basis for concluding that the trial judge
    relied on the sexualized atmosphere of the club as proof that the sexual
    assault occurred, or to support the improper inference that those who would
    work in such a place are less worthy of belief.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, there is no basis for concluding that
    the trial judge relied on the appellant’s general routine during private dances
    to draw impermissible propensity inferences or to find that he is not of
    credible character. She referred to the appellant’s general routine during private
    dances because the appellant relied upon that routine in recounting his version
    of events, and because his description of his routine included his admission
    that he would determine whether a client was consenting by touching her and
    gauging her reaction. There is simply no basis for concluding that the trial
    judge inferred that as a sex worker, the appellant is less worthy of belief, or
    more likely to commit sexual offences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor is there any basis for concluding that the
    trial judge relied on the stereotype of the sexually naïve woman to bolster the
    complainant’s credibility or to undermine the appellant’s credibility. Instead,
    the trial judge accepted the complainant’s direct testimony that she was
    shocked at what was taking place, and that based on her one prior visit to a
    strip club where she had gone for a private dance, she was not expecting the
    kind of sexual contact that she alleged. These were findings the trial judge
    was entitled to make.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We also reject the appellant’s contention that
    the trial judge disregarded evidence about the complainant’s conduct leading up
    to the alleged assault. The trial judge was acutely aware that while attending
    a bachelorette party at a strip club, and after seeing fully naked men, the complainant
    purchased a lap dance and voluntarily entered a private booth with the
    appellant. The trial judge recounted all of this in her reasons for judgment. Although
    a trial judge must consider the factual context within which allegations are
    made, as the appellant conceded in oral argument, none of these circumstances
    required the trial judge to have a reasonable doubt relating to the complainant’s
    denial of consent. The complainant described her state of mind and the trial
    judge believed her. No issues of stereotype or double standards arise.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, there is no merit in the appellant’s
    claim that the trial judge evoked the stereotype that sexual activity with a
    sex worker is “naughty” and something to be ashamed of. It was the appellant who
    advanced this theory by suggesting that the complainant concocted the sexual
    assault allegation because she regretted having let things go so far and had “bride’s
    remorse”. The trial judge’s conclusion that if the complainant had indeed been remorseful,
    she could easily have kept her conduct secret by saying nothing as the events
    took place in a private area, was a reasoned and appropriate basis for
    rejecting the defence theory as implausible.</span></p>

    judge applied uneven scrutiny to the evidence. As we have explained, she gave
    cogent and compelling reasons for rejecting the credibility of the exculpatory
    claims the appellant made in his police statement. We can find no basis for
    concluding that the trial judge applied a different standard in finding that
    the comparatively minor imperfections in the complainant’s evidence did not
    undermine her credibility. </span></p>
