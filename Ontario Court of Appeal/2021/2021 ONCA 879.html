    appeal from the acquittals entered by Justice of the Peace B.I. Leaman, dated
    September 18, 2017.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Trotter J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal arises from a workplace accident
    that injured two individuals.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Miller Group Inc. (hereafter “Miller”) was contracted
    to pave a road in Northern Ontario. Mr. Fernandes, an employee of Miller,
    supervised the job. A piece of heavy equipment, a rubber tire roller, was used in
    the paving project. The roller went out of control and it ended up in a ditch.
    The operator of the roller was hospitalized for 11 days; another employee, who
    was able to jump out of the way, suffered less serious injuries.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The incident was reported to the Ministry of
    Labour (“MOL”).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Investigators attended at the scene and seized the roller under the <em>Occupational
    Health and Safety Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1 (“<i>OHSA</i>”). Before the
    roller was inspected, a lawyer for Miller wrote to the MOL inspectors and
    alleged that the machinery had been unlawfully seized. He further directed that
    no inspection could be performed unless his client consented.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Despite the lawyer’s letter, the inspection
    proceeded. This involved disassembling the roller. Before releasing the roller
    back to Miller, the inspectors offered to re-assemble it. Miller declined the
    offer and gave the roller away as scrap without conducting any testing of its
    own.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Miller (as an employer) and Mr. Fernandes (as a
    supervisor) were charged with workplace safety offences under ss. 25(1) and
    27(1)(a) of the <em>OSHA</em>, respectively. Miller brought a pre-trial <em>Charter</em> application alleging infringements of its rights under ss. 8 and 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Justice of the Peace dismissed the s. 8
    claim, but found that the conduct of the inspectors infringed s. 11(d) because:
    (a) they should have halted their inspection in light of the lawyer’s letter;
    (b) they failed to keep proper notes; (c)&nbsp;they did not follow internal
    policy manuals; and (d) their testimony was conflicting. The Justice of the
    Peace excluded the results of the inspection under either ss. 24(1) or (2) of
    the <em>Charter</em>, the precise basis being unclear. The Crown called no further
    evidence and the charges were dismissed against Miller and Mr. Fernandes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s appeal to a judge of the Ontario
    Court of Justice (“the appeal judge”) was dismissed. She found that the Justice
    of the Peace made no legal errors in excluding the evidence as a remedy for the
    breach of s. 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. She determined that it was
    unnecessary to address the submissions of Miller and Mr. Fernandes that there
    was also a breach s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nordheimer J.A. granted the Crown’s application
    for leave to appeal under s. 131 of the <em>Provincial Offences Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 33.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    Crown’s appeal and order a new trial. The Justice of the Peace erred in finding
    that the lawyer’s letter required the inspectors to only conduct an examination
    of the machine in the presence of the representative(s) of Miller. Neither
    Miller nor Mr. Fernandes had any right to direct the investigation into
    offences under the <em>OHSA</em>. This made inconsistencies in the evidence of
    the inspectors irrelevant for <em>Charter</em> adjudication purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, the failure of the inspectors to
    observe internal policy guidelines could not amount to a violation of s. 11(d)
    of the <em>Charter</em>. Although deviations from these normative practices may
    impact on the value of the inspectors’ testimony on the trial proper, these
    documents had no force of law for constitutional purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Justice of the Peace also erred in finding an
    infringement of s. 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. He employed the wrong
    analytical framework in adjudicating what was essentially a lost or destroyed evidence
    claim. More fundamentally, neither Miller nor Mr. Fernandes established any
    prejudice flowing from the MOL’s handling or inspection of the roller. To the
    contrary, Miller gave the roller away as scrap, essentially precluding further
    testing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal judge erred in law by adopting the
    reasons of the Justice of the Peace and, without further analysis, simply
    endorsed his legal errors.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The accident occurred on August 18, 2015 on a
    roadway approximately 40 kilometers outside of Thunder Bay, Ontario. On the
    same day, MOL inspectors attended at the scene, which was considered to be a
    “workplace” within the meaning of the <em>OHSA</em>. Inspector Thomas Grant
    photographed the scene and interviewed some of the workers. He made notes and
    issued a Field Visit Report (“FVR”) in which he described the investigatory actions
    he had taken. Engineer Jeff Rivard also attended and observed a broken brake
    line on the roller which he thought had been broken before the incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Acting under the authority of s. 54 of the <em>OHSA</em>,

    disassembled and inspected.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Letter and the “Stand Down” Order</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 21, 2015, prior to the machine being
    inspected, a lawyer for Miller wrote to Mr. Grant to complain that the roller
    had been illegally seized. The letter also purported to direct the course of
    the investigation:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Our client intends to cooperate with the
    Ministry of Labour’s investigation of the above-noted incident. <u>In the
    spirit of mutual cooperation, and to ensure no spoilage of the equipment or
    evidence to be gathered, we request that no steps be taken by a Ministry of
    Labour Engineer or other technical expert without our clients’ knowledge and
    consent. Further, any steps taken to test the equipment involved in the
    incident, replace parts on the equipment, or any other technical aspect of the
    investigation should only be done with our clients’ knowledge and consent.</u></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Further to the above, we request that copies
    of any Field Visit Reports or Orders related to this matter be copied to me
    immediately upon issue. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was not until August 24, 2015 that Mr. Grant
    accessed the letter on his laptop computer. Not familiar with this type of
    request, he forwarded the letter to his acting manager, Cary Roy. In the
    meantime, he claimed to have given a “stand down” order to Mr. Holder and Mr.
    Rivard, who were involved in testing the roller that day. The evidence of MOL
    personnel, however, was contradictory on this point. The Justice of the Peace
    found that the note-taking of Mr. Grant was lacking in certain respects. Mr.
    Grant admitted that he did not follow MOL guidelines with respect to notetaking,
    what should be included in FVR’s, and when items are seized from a work site.
    Mr. Roy also received similar criticism by the Justice of the Peace.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Roy’s credibility was a matter of
    considerable importance to the Justice of the Peace, especially on the “stand
    down” issue. Phone records did not support his version of events. The Justice
    of the Peace found Mr. Roy to be “nervous, defensive and evasive when being
    questioned by Miller’s lawyer”. But it is unnecessary to go into further detail
    on this issue because, as discussed below, it did not matter at this stage of
    the proceedings. I assume for the sake of argument on this appeal that the
    evidence was inconsistent and contradictory.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Rivard, an engineer, was questioned about a
    document prepared by the Professional Engineers of Ontario (“PEO”) entitled
    “Forensic Engineering Investigations.” Among other things, the document reads:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If destructive inspection/testing is required,
    all interested parties should be provided an opportunity to review and comment
    on the inspection/testing protocol and hold points, and witness the
    inspection/testing. The aim should be to reach consensus as to the
    inspection/testing protocol. Even when all parties are present, any disassembly
    or inspection that changes the state of the evidence should be documented in
    detail for ease of future explanation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Despite the letter from the lawyer, the
    inspection proceeded without the consent of, and in the absence of, anyone
    representing Miller. Photographs and notes were taken during the inspection
    process.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following the inspection, the roller was
    returned to Miller. As noted, the MOL offered to reassemble the machine. The
    offer was refused. The roller was “taken out of service” and given to Gary
    Steele Haulage &amp; Grading Limited. At the time of the motion before the
    Justice of the Peace, the roller was still at this location; however, the
    engine, transmission, and wheels had been removed. There was no evidence that
    it was further inspected at the direction of Miller or Mr. Fernandes.</span></p>

    “troubling”. He explained:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Based on the inconsistent evidence among Mr.
    Grant, Mr. Roy and Mr. Rivard, when added to that of Mr.&nbsp;Holder, this
    Court is left in great doubt as to the credibility and reliability of each of

    the heart of the s. 11(d) motion made by Miller</u>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Justice of the Peace acknowledged that the <em>OHSA</em> did not require a representative of the employer to be present for the
    inspection of the roller. He nonetheless concluded that “fairness dictated that
    should have been so, especially in light of the lawyer’s letter.” He further
    found that Mr. Rivard’s failure to follow the PEO guidelines:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>contributed to the defendants being deprived
    of the opportunity to participate in the inspection of the seized machine to
    the extent that spoilation occurred. The machine, once inspected on August 24
    by disassembly of some of its components, was no longer in the state it was on
    August 18 when it was seized.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>This Court acknowledges that it <u>seems odd</u> that Miller, through Mr. Fernandes, when given the opportunity to have the
    machine put back together chose not to do so, nor did they have the machine
    tested or examined, especially the transmission since that component was a
    potential problem with it according to some of Miller’s employees at the work
    site. <u>However, in this Court’s view, those actions or inactions do not
    undermine the defendants’ rights under s. 11(d) of the </u><em>Charter</em>.

lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the issue of remedy, the Justice of the Peace
    refused to stay the proceedings. He said, “Again, the onus rests on the moving
    party to show on a balance of probabilities that the admission of the evidence
    would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, as noted in s. 24(2)
    of the <em>Charter</em>.” He relied on <em>Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. JR

    “[f]ollowing the <em>Grant</em> analysis”, the impact of the breach denied
    Miller and Mr. Fernandes the opportunity to make full answer and defence. He
    ultimately concluded that the admission of the evidence would bring the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Justice of the Peace erred in finding that
    the <em>Charter</em> rights of Miller and Mr. Fernandes were infringed by the
    manner in which the investigation was conducted. The appeal judge erred in law in
    upholding this decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The root of the problem stemmed from the
    lawyer’s letter and the effect given to it by the Justice of the Peace. This
    erroneous treatment of the letter spawned a cascade of further errors. For
    instance, testimonial inconsistencies associated with sharing the “stand down”
    order and the adequacy of the inspectors’ note-taking, while potentially
    relevant at trial, were not capable of supporting a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>violation.
    Nor could a failure to follow internal protocols sustain such an infringement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Most importantly, the courts below erred in
    granting (the Justice of the Peace) and upholding (the appeal judge) a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>remedy in the absence of evidence that Miller or Mr. Fernandes suffered any
    prejudice.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>No Right to Direct the Investigation</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted above, the lawyer’s letter insisted on
    the rights of knowledge and consent in the investigative process. Presumably
    based on the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Rivard’s failure to follow PEO guidelines, this
    assertion morphed into an insistence on the right to be present during the
    inspection. The lawyer’s letter never made such an extravagant claim.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the criminal law context, the right to make
    full answer and defence in s.&nbsp;11(d) of the <em>Charter</em> does not
    extend so far: <em>R. v. Darwish</em>, 2010 ONCA 124, 100 O.R. (3d) 579, at
    paras. 29-31. An accused person does not have a “constitutional right to direct
    the conduct of a police investigation of which she or he is the target”: <em>Spackman</em>,
    at para. 108. The police are not required to obtain the consent of the accused
    person before taking investigative steps. An accused person has no right to
    insist that further or other investigative steps be taken. Nor are the police
    required to permit the target of investigation to be present during the
    inspection or testing of physical evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I use as an example a case of dangerous operation
    of a conveyance (i.e., a motor vehicle) causing bodily harm (<em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 320.13(2)). The driver loses control of a vehicle and
    ends up in a ditch. The driver is seriously injured, but their passenger
    escapes with less serious injuries. Once the vehicle is lawfully seized, the
    police do not require the consent of the driver and/or owner of the vehicle to conduct
    a mechanical inspection of the vehicle. There is no entitlement to be present
    during the inspection of the vehicle. Instead, the obligation of the police is
    to preserve items so that they may be tested or examined by the accused: <em>R.
    v. La</em>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 680, at paras. 17 and 20. It should be no different
    with <em>OHSA</em> investigations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are strong policy reasons for this
    conclusion. Criminal investigations carry the potential for much more
    significant consequences than <em>OHSA</em> investigations. If the former does
    not attract such a right, no such right should exist in the latter context. It
    would be unreasonable to conclude that the subjects of <em>OHSA</em> investigations have <em>Charter</em> rights above and beyond those afforded to
    subjects of true criminal investigations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, as the Crown submits, a requirement of
    knowledge and consent, let alone presence, could thwart or stall timely
    investigations, potentially endangering the very people the <em>OHSA</em> is
    meant to protect (i.e. workers) and the public in general.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The reach of the <em>OHSA</em><i> </i>is broad.
    Section 1 of the Act defines a “workplace” as “any land, premises, location or
    thing at, upon, in or near which a worker works.” Investigators must be permitted
    to respond to workplace incidents swiftly and efficiently. As Nordheimer J.A.
    said in granting leave to appeal in this case, at para.&nbsp;16: “One can
    think, for example, of accidents involving collapsed cranes, collapsed
    scaffolding, elevator failures, and a host of other accidents that involved the
    operation of all sorts of pieces of equipment.” Serious disruption to the <em>OHSA</em> mandate could result if investigators were constitutionally required to
    accommodate the type of request made in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Consequently, the Justice of the Peace and the
    appeal judge erred in finding a constitutional right to participate in the
    examination of the roller. It did not amount to an infringement of s. 11(d) of
    the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Relatedly, the Justice of the Peace also
    identified his concerns with the credibility of MOL inspectors, related to
    their divergent evidence on whether a “stand down” order was made, and whether
    it was in fact communicated to those involved in the inspection of the roller. In
    the criminal context, the credibility of police officers is often relevant to
    the adjudication of <em>Charter</em> claims. The “who did what and why or why not”
    are essential to <em>Charter</em><i> </i>claims. In determining whether rights
    have been infringed, trial judges are often called upon to resolve credibility
    issues as between police officers, and between the police and the accused
    person. Failing to do so may amount to a fatal error. In <em>R. v. McCarthy</em> (1996), 91 O.A.C. 348 (C.A.), rev’d [1996] 2 S.C.R. 460, a new trial was
    ordered because the trial judge failed to resolve credibility issues on a s. 8 <em>Charter
    voir dire</em> on the issue of whether the search was conducted in a reasonable
    manner.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is not such a case. As discussed above, the
    question of whether the inspectors should have bowed to the lawyer’s letter was
    not a legitimate <em>Charter</em> claim. Accordingly, the credibility of the
    inspectors on this issue was immaterial at this stage of proceedings. It should
    not have factored into the decision on whether s. 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em> had been infringed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, the Justice of the Peace and the
    appeal judge were troubled by the failure of the MOL to follow its own manual
    or guidelines, as well as Mr. Rivard’s failure to follow PEO guidelines. Although
    these failings may be relevant to the credibility of these witnesses and their
    competence in conducting the inspection, these are issues to be considered by
    the trier of fact. The underlying manuals/documents that were seemingly ignored
    by the inspectors do not attain the status of legal authority upon which a <em>Charter</em> breach may be founded: see <em>R.&nbsp;v. Jageshur</em><i> </i>(2002), 169
    C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 50-53; <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Dallas</em>,
    2002 BCSC 760, at paras. 104-5.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both courts below erred in their methodological
    approach to the claim that the disassembly of the roller amounted to a breach
    of s. 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. Ultimately, this was a case of lost or
    destroyed evidence. The procedure for adjudicating these types of claims has
    long been established. Lost or destroyed evidence claims are governed by ss. 7
    and 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>, tied to an individual’s right to a fair
    trial and right to make full answer and defence. In this case, both courts
    below erred in finding a breach of s. 11(d) in the absence of a finding of
    prejudice. Moreover, the appeal judge further erred in relying on <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Harrer</em> as a route to exclude the evidence.</span></p>

    of the <em>Charter</em>, the Crown has a duty to preserve relevant evidence: <em>R.
    v. Egger</em>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451, at p. 472; <em>La</em>, at para. 17. When
    relevant evidence is lost or destroyed, the Crown must satisfy the court that
    it was not lost or destroyed as a result of unacceptable negligence: <em>La</em>,
    at para. 20; <em>R. v. Abreha</em>, 2019 ONCA 392, at para. 11; <em>R. v. Hersi</em>,

    1994 ABCA 113, 88 C.C.C. (3d) 557, aff’d [1995] 1 S.C.R. 754. If the Crown satisfies
    this threshold, s. 7 has not been breached; conversely, a failure to establish
    that the destruction was not due to unacceptable negligence will amount to an
    infringement of s. 7. Depending on the circumstances, it may also amount to an
    abuse of process: <em>La</em>, at para. 23.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In order to obtain a stay of proceedings, it

    were allowed to continue: <em>La,</em> at para. 24; <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Bero</em> (2000), 137 O.A.C. 336, 151 C.C.C. (3d) 545, at para. 42. However, “[a] stay of

    Generally speaking, a motion for a stay based on lost or destroyed evidence
    should not be brought at the outset of the trial. It should be brought at the
    end of trial. This was addressed in <em>Bero</em>, where the police
    relinquished control of a vehicle that was subsequently sold to and destroyed
    by an auto wrecker. The trial judge entertained a motion to stay proceedings as
    a pre-trial motion. As Doherty J.A. said, at para. 18:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge should not have ruled on the
    motion at the outset of the trial. This Court has repeatedly indicated that <u>except
    where the appropriateness of a stay is manifest at the outset of proceedings</u>,
    a trial judge should reserve on motions such as the motion brought in this case
    until after the evidence has been heard. <u>The trial judge can more

    not “manifest” at the outset of the proceedings for the simple reason that
    there was no evidence that the right to make full answer and defence had been

    establish any prejudice at all. Miller refused the offer to reassemble the

    request to inspect the vehicle and no prejudice was established in any event).
    This same approach has been applied in cases prosecuted under the <em>OHSA</em>.
    In <em>Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Lee Valley Tools Ltd.</em>, 2009 ONCA
    387, 264 O.A.C. 213, Lang J.A. said, at para. 32: “Actual prejudice cannot be

    case, the lawyer’s letter, albeit misguided, was a timely attempt to exert some

    not obtained in an unconstitutional manner; specifically, although there were
    no direct breaches of <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rights in testing the machine,
    “[t]he unfairness would result in allowing the evidence to be introduced at
    trial given the manner in which it was obtained and not affording the
    Respondent’s the ability to participate in the inspection.”</span></p>

    in this case. It amounted to a circumvention of the principles in <em>Darwish</em> and <em>Spackman</em>. As noted above, those cases held that there is no right
    of an accused person to direct an investigation. Purporting to apply <em>Harrer</em>,
    the appeal judge achieved the opposite result by justifying a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>remedy for this very reason.</span></p>

    applicable, Miller and Mr. Fernandes run into the same problem – there was no
    evidence of prejudice to their right to make full answer and defence. In <em>Spackman</em>,
    Watt J.A. held that, at para. 103: “The remedy of evidentiary exclusion under
    s. 24(1) is not for the asking. An accused who seeks this remedy must establish
    a breach of his or her <em>Charter</em> rights: the right to a fair trial in
    accordance with ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>.” Miller and Mr.
    Fernandes failed to do so. Any prejudice they suffered was self-inflicted –
    they declined the offer to have the roller reassembled and then they got rid of
    it. The Justice of the Peace found that this conduct seemed “odd.” In fact, it
    was fatal to any claim to <em>Charter</em> relief.</span></p>

    denied. As Moldaver J.A. (as he then was) said at para. 55:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is common ground that in the context of
    this Crown appeal, the respondents may raise additional alleged errors by the

    alleged additional errors insofar as they relate to conviction: see<i> <em>R.
