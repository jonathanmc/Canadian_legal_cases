    two other co-accused, was convicted of various offences related to the
    trafficking and sexual assault of a 15-year-old complainant. The appellant was
    sentenced to nine years in custody, along with a DNA order under ss. 487.04 and
    487.051(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, an order under s. 490.013(2.1) of the <em>Code</em> to comply with the <em>Sex Offender Information Registration Act</em> for life, restrictions on his internet use pursuant to s. 161 of the <em>Code</em>,<em> </em>as well as prohibitions against possessing weapons and contacting the

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified that <a

    assaulted and sexually assaulted her was an individual with the street name “Taffa”.
    The complainant eventually identified the appellant as Taffa.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals on the ground that the
    trial judge erred in his charge to the jury with respect to identification
    evidence and how he dealt with the evidence regarding the police’s failure to
    conduct a photo line-up.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant does not challenge that the
    complainant was 15 at the material time, or the jury findings about how she was
    deceptively recruited, exploited, and then abused for days before escaping from
    the hotel room where the offences occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, in particular, does not dispute
    the role played by the person referred to by the complainant as “Taffa” in the
    ordeal. The complainant alleged that Taffa physically blocked the door when the
    complainant sought to leave the hotel room, threatened her, assaulted her, and
    sexually assaulted her on several occasions. The complainant eventually managed
    to escape the hotel and contact police.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>She identified the profile picture of a person
    named “Stay Humble” as Taffa in a printed list of a co-accused’s Facebook
    friends. Eventually, with the assistance of further identification evidence
    from the complainant, the police linked Taffa to the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Almost six months after the offence, the
    appellant was arrested and charged with various offences relating to the
    complainant’s confinement, assault, sexual assault and trafficking.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the appellant’s Notice of Appeal raises
    issues with respect to both the conviction and sentence, counsel for the
    appellant clarified that the appellant now limits his appeal to the trial
    judge’s charge to the jury on identification evidence and the trial judge’s
    treatment of the evidence of the police’s failure to conduct a photo line-up.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Did the Trial Judge’s err in his charge to
    the jury on the identification evidence?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The review of a trial judge’s charge is a
    functional exercise. As this court stated in <em>R. v. Badgerow</em>, 2019 ONCA
    374, 146 O.R. (3d) 35, at para. 17:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Appellate review of the adequacy of a jury
    instruction requires a functional assessment. The court asks whether the
    charge, read as a whole in the context of the specific case, properly equipped
    the jury to decide the case based on the application of the applicable legal
    principles to the evidence. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his charge, the trial judge described the
    threshold for identification as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>For any particular accused to be found guilty
    of an offence, Crown Counsel must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    “someone” in question – that is, the person who engaged in certain conduct said
    to constitute an offence charged against that particular accused – was, in
    fact, the particular accused who is charged with the offence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in instructing the jury by conflating the two steps required in the
    identification process: first, it had to be established that Taffa was indeed
    the person involved in the alleged crimes, and second, that the appellant was
    Taffa. The appellant takes no issue with the jury’s finding with respect to the
    first step. However, the appellant argues that the trial judge failed to
    clarify for the jury what had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt at the
    second step.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the Crown, the jury drew inferences
    that were available to it from the record, including that the appellant’s phone
    number was the same as Taffa’s, and that the appellant conceded that an image
    of Taffa, captured in a still-shot from a music video, appeared to be an image
    of him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not accept the submission that the trial
    judge failed to instruct the jury on the importance of considering not simply
    the identification of Taffa as the alleged assailant but also that the
    appellant was Taffa. The trial judge made it clear that the identification of
    the appellant as Taffa had to be established beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury was repeatedly cautioned about general
    and specific frailties related to the identification evidence. For example, the
    trial judge explained:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>You must be very cautious about relying on
    eyewitness testimony to find a particular accused guilty of any criminal
    offence charged. In the past, there have been miscarriages of justice, and
    innocent persons have been wrongfully convicted, because eyewitnesses have made
    honest mistakes in identifying the person or persons whom they saw committing a
    crime or crimes. Eyewitness identification may seem more reliable than it
    actually is because it is given by a credible and convincing witness who
    honestly, but perhaps mistakenly, believes that the accused is the person whom
    he or she saw committing an offence in question.</span></p>

    identification evidence in relation to all the accused, but focused on the
    appellant. He stated, “[c]learly, I think, the most significant identity issues
    in this case relate to whether the perpetrator known and described principally
    as ‘Taffa’ was, in fact, the accused Mr. Hird.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This identification evidence consisted primarily
    of the complainant’s testimony. In his charge, the trial judge reviewed her
    testimony in detail, including her inconsistencies and memory lapses. He also
    reviewed the frailties with her evidence raised by the appellant at trial, namely
    that the complainant consumed drugs, including methamphetamine, during the
    period of the alleged crimes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a

    corroborated by other evidence. For example, the appellant’s phone number and the
    image of him in the music video.</span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Additionally, the draft jury charge was shared
    with defence counsel. Defence counsel did not object to the charge in relation
    to the identification evidence, aside from the issue of the police line-up,
    addressed below. While not determinative, the failure of the defence to object
    to the charge when they had an opportunity is relevant in assessing the
    adequacy of the jury charge: <em>R. v. Bailey</em>, 2016 ONCA 516, 339 C.C.C.
    (3d) 643, at para. 56.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the appellant argues that the trial
    judge should have raised the difficulties of cross-racial identification in his
    charge to the jury. There was no suggestion in this case that the complainant
    had any difficulty identifying the appellant as a result of race. Further,
    there is nothing in the record on the demographic make-up of the jury that
    would raise this as an issue. Absent specific evidence of cross-racial
    identification concerns, there is no basis as a general matter to conclude the
    jury would need to be instructed on the issue of cross-racial identification.</span></p>

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Did the trial judge err in how he dealt with

lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel wished to cross examine a police
    witness on the police’s failure to conduct a photo line-up containing a known
    image of the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police witness stated that a photo line-up
    was not used because the police had no doubt that the appellant was the
    individual identified by the complainant as Taffa.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The basis for the police witness’ confidence in
    the identification of the appellant was a statement made to the police by the
    appellant after his arrest. This statement was subsequently ruled inadmissible by
    the trial judge after a <em>voir dire </em>on voluntariness.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the Crown could not rely on the appellant’s
    statement, the trial judge accepted the Crown’s submission that it would be
    unfair to permit defence counsel to cross-examine the police witness on this
    point. Allowing the line of questioning could have undermined the integrity of
    the investigation even though police had grounds to conclude the investigation at
    that time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was significant discussion of this point
    between counsel and the trial judge. In the end, the trial judge permitted
    defence counsel to cross-examine the police witness on why the police had not
    conducted a photo line-up prior to the appellant’s arrest, but not with respect
    to the period after the statement by the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge provided a mid-trial jury
    instruction on this issue. He instructed the jury:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]o proceed on the basis that the police had
    reasons at the time for not employing the police photo lineup procedure, but
    you are not permitted to hear those reasons, speculate as to what those reasons

    that procedure after Mr. Hird’s arrest were sufficient or not.</span></p>
