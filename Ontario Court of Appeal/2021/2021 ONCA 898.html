lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal
    and set aside the dismissal order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A decision whether to set aside an
    administrative dismissal involves an exercise of discretion guided by certain
    principles. Relevant factors include whether there is an explanation for the
    delay, whether the dismissal arose due to inadvertence, whether the motion to
    re-instate the proceeding was brought promptly, and whether there is prejudice.
    These factors are not, however, to be viewed as a series of rigid hurdles for
    the moving party to meet. Rather, a contextual approach is to be taken. The
    overall question is whether it is just to uphold the dismissal in all of the
    circumstances, weighing two competing policy objectives: the objective that
    proceedings should be determined on their merits, and the objective that
    proceedings should be resolved in a timely and efficient manner to maintain
    public confidence in the administration of justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the motion judge made errors in
    principle which, in this case, justify appellate interference with her exercise
    of discretion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge properly found that there had
    been a delay in moving the application forward for which no adequate explanation
    was offered; however, she in essence treated that factor as a rigid unmet
    hurdle. Although she noted that the dismissal arose due to inadvertence of the appellant’s
    lawyer, and that the appellant’s motion to set aside the dismissal order was
    brought promptly, she failed to ascribe any significance to those factors, and erred
    in her analysis of prejudice. She failed to take the proper contextual approach
    and to consider the policy </span>favouring<span lang=EN-US> the resolution of this
    proceeding on its merits. Moreover, after recognizing that the absence of a
    limitation period for support claims meant that the appellant could start a new
    proceeding, she failed to consider how upholding the dismissal would actually advance
    the goal of timely and efficient resolution.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On a proper consideration of all the circumstances,
    the dismissal should have been set aside.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Steps in 2017-2018</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On October 23, 2017, the appellant commenced an
    application for spousal support against the respondent. She alleged that,
    although she and the respondent were not married, they had cohabited
    continuously between 2005 to 2016 and were therefore spouses with support
    entitlements and obligations under Part III of the <em>Family Law Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3</span></em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent filed an answer in December 2017.
    He disputed the appellant’s characterization of their relationship and that
    they had cohabited continuously for over three years (the relevant time period
    to trigger spousal status under Part III of the <i>Family Law Act</i>:<i> </i>s.
    29). Therefore, he denied that she had any entitlement to support from him, as
    she lacked the status of a spouse.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There was activity in the litigation in 2018.
    The parties attended a case conference in March 2018. The lawyer for the
    appellant arranged for questioning and cross-examination on financial
    statements to take place. The respondent’s questioning was, at his counsel’s
    request, scheduled to accommodate his travels outside of Canada, and was
    completed on October 29, 2018. The appellant’s questioning was completed on
    November 1, 2018.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In early November 2018, the lawyers for the
    parties exchanged correspondence. The appellant’s lawyer provided certain documents
    and indicated that the appellant was in the process of collecting other
    information and documents relating to undertakings given on her questioning. He
    also demanded certain productions from the respondent; when they were not
    forthcoming, he indicated he would bring a motion.</span></p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Deadline for
    Dismissal</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As the appellant’s case was not in the Family
    Court of the Superior Court of Justice, r. 41 of the <em>Family Law Rules</em> applied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> On October 26, 2018, a clerk of the Superior
    Court sent a notice of approaching dismissal under r. 41(5) of the <em>Family
    Law Rules</em>, as the case had not been settled, withdrawn, or scheduled for
    trial within 365 days of its commencement. The notice provided that the clerk
    would dismiss the case unless, within 60 days (that is, by December 27, 2018), one
    of the steps specified in r.&nbsp;41(6) of the <em>Family Law Rules</em> was
    taken. Those steps are: obtaining an order lengthening time, filing an
    agreement for a final order disposing of all issues and a notice of motion to
    carry out the agreement, serving a notice of withdrawal discontinuing the case,
    scheduling the case for trial, or arranging a case conference or settlement
    conference for the first available date.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One of those steps — obtaining an order lengthening
    time — was taken. The court made an order on December 6, 2018, on the consent
    of the parties, extending the “time for dismissal” that had been specified in
    the notice to October 25, 2019. In other words, October 25, 2019 became the new
    deadline by which one of the steps in r. 41(6) had to be taken to avoid
    dismissal of the application by the clerk.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Notwithstanding the importance of this deadline,
    the appellant’s lawyer did not diarize it, due to what the motion judge
    accepted was inadvertence.</span></p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>2019 and the
    Administrative Dismissal</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant gave evidence that she met with
    her lawyer in February 2019. He told her to prepare a list of witnesses who
    would have to meet with him and provide signed statements. She prepared such a
    list and was directed by her lawyer to contact witnesses and arrange
    appointments for them to meet with him. Some witnesses provided statements over
    the next several months, while others were unwilling to get involved. The
    appellant acknowledged that the compilation of a final witness list for a
    settlement conference was delayed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, the only communication between counsel
    in 2019, prior to the new dismissal date, was a letter dated July 6, 2019, in
    which counsel for the respondent wrote to the appellant’s lawyer, listing the
    undertakings given on the appellant’s questioning, and requesting answers by
    the end of the month.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That letter was not answered, and prior to
    October 25, 2019, none of the steps specified in r. 41(6) to prevent dismissal of
    the action were taken.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, on October 26, 2019, the court
    issued an order under r. 41(6) of the <em>Family Law Rules</em>, dismissing the
    appellant’s application.</span></p>
  <h3>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Motion to Set
    Aside</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s lawyer received the dismissal
    order in November 2019; shortly afterwards, there was a fire at his office
    building, delaying his access to files and equipment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant brought a motion to set aside the
    dismissal order under r.&nbsp;41(9) on February 27, 2020, returnable March 20,
    2020. As a result of the pandemic, the motion could not be heard until August
    14, 2020.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion was supported by an affidavit of the
    appellant which outlined the history described above, and stated that she had
    maintained her desire to proceed with her claim for support throughout, wished
    to proceed with it, and was “prepared to do what is necessary to expedite the
    hearing of a Settlement Conference and thereafter expedite the Trial in this
    matter.” Her lawyer’s assistant swore an affidavit that she had inadvertently
    failed to diarize the date for dismissal of October&nbsp;25, 2019, that her
    office had continued to “process the Application … to October 25<sup>th</sup>,
    2019”, and that at no time was she given any indication by the appellant or her
    lawyer that the appellant’s “claims were not being pursued”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent also swore an affidavit. Among
    other things, he swore that he was told by his lawyer of the dismissal order on
    November 4, 2019 and that the appellant had to move expeditiously to set it
    aside “if it came about inadvertently and she wished to continue with her
    Application.” <a name="_Hlk87622413">He also stated that “[a]s time passed,
    [he] came to believe that the matter was finished”, that the “Application has
    been a source of stress and aggravation for [him]”, and that he was “pleased
    and relieved when in late 2019 [he] came to believe that it was over”.</a></span></p>
  <h3>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Motion Judge’s
    Decision</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge referred to the onus on family
    law litigants to move cases forward in a timely manner, with the expectation
    set by rr. 41(5) and (6) that they will be resolved or scheduled for trial
    within a year. She noted that the timelines exist for a purpose, related to the
    invasive nature of family law litigation and the burden it often places on
    parties, and that the court should not rubber-stamp requests to set aside
    administrative dismissals. She referred to case law from this court, including <em>H.B.
    Fuller Company v. Rogers (Rogers Law Office)</em>, 2015&nbsp;ONCA&nbsp;173, 386
    D.L.R. (4th) 262, that set out the principles to be considered when deciding whether
    to set aside an administrative dismissal in civil cases under r. 48 of the <em>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194. She accepted that the civil approach
    should inform the approach to an administrative dismissal under the <em>Family
    Law Rules</em>, within the context of the primary objective of those rules, dealing

    the delay that led to the dismissal order, whether the deadline set out in the

    that the appellant had not provided an adequate explanation of the litigation
    delay that followed the extension, in late&nbsp;2018, of the deadline for dismissal.
    On the second, she accepted the evidence of the appellant’s lawyer’s legal
    assistant that she had inadvertently failed to diarize the dismissal date of
    October 26, 2019, and that the appellant had been in touch with her lawyer’s
    office up to that date and never indicated an intention to discontinue her
    proceeding. The motion judge considered that to be an explanation as to why the
    lawyer’s office did not deal with the case when the dismissal date was
    approaching, but not an explanation as to why no real steps were taken in the
    12 months prior to the dismissal date.</span></p>

  <p class=Heading>DISCUSSION</p>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The <em>Fuller</em> Principles Apply to Family Law Administrative Dismissals</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the motion judge that the
    principles derived in the context of civil cases, such as <em>Fuller</em>, are appropriate
    to inform the approach to motions under r.&nbsp;41(9) of the <em>Family Law
    Rules</em>. Although the motion judge went on to state that those principles must
    be considered in the context of the primary objective of the <em>Family Law
    Rules</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> as described in rr.
    2(2)-(4), I do not read the motion judge to have been suggesting that this
    justified a departure from the approach in <em>Fuller</em>. In any event, in my
    view, there is nothing inconsistent between the <em>Fuller</em> principles and
    the fulfillment of the primary objective of the <em>Family Law Rules</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, dealing with cases justly</span></em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-US>Fuller</span></em><span lang=EN-US> holds,
    at para. 20, that on a motion to set aside an administrative dismissal, the
    court should consider the <em>Reid</em> factors: the length of the delay and whether
    there is an explanation for it, whether the failure to meet mandated time
    limits was due to inadvertence, whether the motion to set aside the dismissal
    order was brought promptly, and whether delay has prejudiced the responding
    party.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But <em>Fuller</em> makes it clear that these
    factors are not to be treated as a rigid set of hurdles the moving party must
    meet. Instead, an overall contextual approach is required that takes into
    account those factors and all of the relevant circumstances, including the
    conduct of both parties. The goal is to reach a just result, bearing in mind
    two underlying principles that can be in tension: (i) that actions should be
    decided on their merits, and (ii) that actions should be resolved in a timely
    and efficient manner to maintain public confidence in the administration of
    justice: <em>Fuller</em>, at paras. 21-25.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-US>Fuller</span></em><span lang=EN-US> also
    explains that, in general, the court’s preference will be to decide matters on
    their merits. This preference will be “more pronounced” where delay results
    from an error of counsel, so as not to penalize a client for inadvertence of
    their lawyer. The rights of all parties must be considered, including whether
    the defendant has suffered non-compensable prejudice as a result of the delay,
    whether a fair trial is still possible, and whether the defendant placed
    justifiable reliance on the termination of the proceeding: <em>Fuller</em>, at
    paras. 25-28.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Giving effect to these principles is consistent
    with the primary objective of the <em>Family Law Rules</em>: that the court
    deal with cases justly. An administrative dismissal order is a result
    contemplated by the <em>Family Law Rules</em> and recognizes the policy that
    family law cases should be resolved in a timely and efficient manner to
    maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. But the<i> <em>Family
    Law Rules</em></i> also empower a judge to make an order setting aside an
    administrative dismissal, recognizing the policy that cases should be decided
    on their merits. Whether the primary objective is better served in a particular
    case by setting aside the dismissal order and allowing the case to be
    determined on its merits, or by leaving the dismissal order in effect because
    procedural rules were violated, is appropriately guided by the <em>Fuller</em> principles, which address exactly that question — whether upholding or setting
    aside the dismissal is just in all of the circumstances.</span></p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Motion Judge
    Erred in Applying the <em>Fuller</em> Principles</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the motion judge’s approach involved
    three interrelated errors in principle. First, she failed to contextually
    evaluate the <em>Reid</em> factors as <em>Fuller</em> requires, essentially
    treating one as a rigid hurdle and giving no effect to two others. Second, she
    gave erroneous treatment to the factor of prejudice. Third, she failed to
    properly consider whether upholding the dismissal order constituted a just
    result in all of the circumstances, by misapplying the policy </span>favouring<span
lang=EN-US> timely resolution of family law proceedings and not properly
    considering the policy that </span>favours<span lang=EN-US> proceedings being
    determined on their merits.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Motion Judge Ignored Two Factors Rather than Treating the Factors
    Contextually</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge was entitled to find that there
    was no adequate explanation for the lack of activity in moving the case forward
    after 2018. She was right to note that, prior to the administrative dismissal, answers
    to undertakings given at the appellant’s questioning were not provided, no
    response was made to the letter of respondent’s counsel seeking answers, and no
    motion was brought for production from the respondent as her lawyer had, in
    2018, indicated. However, <em>Fuller</em> is clear that the factor of delay
    without an adequate explanation is not to be approached as a rigid obstacle the
    appellant must meet, but rather a factor, among others, to be considered
    contextually.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One of the important contextual factors is
    whether a dismissal was the result of inadvertence. <a name="_Hlk87620180">Proper
    consideration of this factor may require separating the issue of overall delay
    from the precise reason a dismissal occurred.</a></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge accepted the evidence of the
    appellant’s lawyer’s assistant that she had inadvertently neglected to diarize
    the October 2019 dismissal date, and that this explained why the appellant’s lawyer
    did not deal with the case as the dismissal date was approaching. The appellant
    points out, and the respondent does not dispute, that the appellant’s lawyer
    could have dealt with the matter and prevented the dismissal from occurring at any
    time before the dismissal deadline simply by taking the step of arranging a
    case conference or settlement conference for the first available date, as
    contemplated by r. 41(6)(e). Family law conferences are intended to
    significantly move cases forward and are an essential part of the family law
    procedural regime aimed at attaining a just result. At a conference, a judge
    may make orders about disclosure, expert evidence, and time-tabling, as well as
    direct the parties towards out-of-court settlement of some or all issues: <em>Family
    Law Rules</em>, r. 17(8).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In other words, although there was a litigation
    delay, the effect of it could have been avoided at any time up to October 2019,
    but was not, due to lawyer’s inadvertence. This was significant, for two
    related reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, both the existence of a procedural step
    that could get an action back on track and avoid dismissal resulting from
    delay, and the reason why it was not taken, are relevant to whether it is just
    in the circumstances to uphold a dismissal, especially where such a procedural
    step is a codified option under the <em>Family Law Rules</em>. In <em>Fuller</em>,
    the plaintiffs’ action was not expeditiously pursued. A status notice warning the
    plaintiffs of impending dismissal was sent by the court to the wrong address.
    The action was administratively dismissed. The motion judge refused to set aside
    the dismissal, remarking that the plaintiffs, even if they had received the
    status notice and arranged a status hearing, would not have been able to meet
    the test at the status hearing of showing that the action should not be
    dismissed. This court held that the motion judge had erred in failing to
    consider that, because of the non-receipt of the status notice, the plaintiffs
    had lost an opportunity to prevent the action from being dismissed. This loss
    of opportunity had to be considered in assessing whether it was just to set
    aside the dismissal order: <em>Fuller</em>,<i> </i>at paras. 33-36.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the preference of the court for deciding
    matters on their merits, as opposed to terminating actions on procedural
    grounds, is “all the more pronounced” where an error of inadvertence of counsel
    is involved: <em>Fuller</em>, at paras.&nbsp;26-27 and 32.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge did not consider either of
    these points. After accepting that lawyer’s inadvertence was the explanation
    for why no step was taken to deal with the approaching dismissal, she did not
    refer to the loss of the opportunity the appellant had to avoid dismissal and
    get the application back on track by requesting a case or settlement conference.
    Nor did she refer to the significance of the lawyer’s inadvertence having made
    the court’s preference for the determination of the matter on its merits “more
    pronounced”. Instead, she immediately returned to the factor of litigation
    delay, concluding the lawyer’s explanation for why no step was taken to deal
    with the approaching dismissal deadline did not explain the delay that had
    occurred in the litigation during the prior year. In effect, she ignored the
    significance of the fact that the deadline was missed due to lawyer
    inadvertence and treated the prior delay as the only relevant factor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly, on the factor of whether a motion was
    brought promptly to set aside the dismissal order, the motion judge noted that
    the respondent “fairly concedes that this factor has been met.”<a href="#_ftn4"

&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[4]</span></span></span></a> But the motion judge did not
    further discuss what that signified or give it any weight. She did not consider
    this factor as one which bore on the justice of setting aside the dismissal
    order because, unlike the delay that preceded the dismissal, it was not </span>behaviour<span
lang=EN-US> which showed either inertia or a lack of interest in having the
    matter resolved on its merits. Nor did she consider its effect on the issue of
    prejudice, discussed below.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The
    Motion Judge Erred in Her Analysis of Prejudice</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue of prejudice to the respondent is an
    important one in deciding whether a dismissal order should be set aside or
    remain in place. <a name="_Hlk87877859">It is “a key, if not <em>the</em> key
    consideration”: <em>Chrisjohn v. Riley</em>, 2015 ONCA 713, 391 D.L.R. (4th)
    695,<i> </i>at para. 36 (emphasis in original). </a>The court should consider
    whether there is prejudice to the defendant’s ability to defend — that is, whether
    a fair trial is still possible — because of events or steps that occurred
    following the dismissal or that would result from restoring the action. The
    court will also consider whether delay in moving to set aside the dismissal was
    so great that the principle of finality and the defendant’s reliance on the
    dismissal should prevail: <em>Fuller</em>, at paras. 37-45.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Here, there was no evidence of actual prejudice
    affecting fair trial rights. The respondent led no evidence of any witness or
    document that had become unavailable. The motion judge stated that there “is no
    indication that evidence has been lost by the passage of time”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In a proper case, prejudice may be presumed, for
    example, because of the expiry of a limitation period or the death of a
    witness: <em>Fuller</em>, at para. 38. Neither circumstance was present here.
    The motion judge identified the only prejudice to be the passage of time. She
    appears to have considered this to support a presumption of prejudice because
    “it can be presumed that a witness’s recollections will be somewhat dimmed” by
    the passage of time, and because the existence of a family law case may mean that
    the parties are unable to move forward with their lives until it is completed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the motion judge erred in both
    respects. While in certain circumstances, the passage of significant time could
    result in prejudice, the motion judge did not relate her finding about the
    effect of the passage of time on witnesses’ memories to the period of
    approximately four months between the dismissal order and the filing of the motion
    to set it aside. She did not explain how witnesses’ memories would diminish during
    that period. In other words, she did not explain how the respondent would be
    worse off, from the standpoint of witnesses’ ability to recall, than he was
    before the dismissal. Nor did she make any finding that fair trial rights were
    affected. Accordingly, this finding of prejudice is tainted by legal error and
    cannot stand.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The finding of prejudice due to the nature of
    family law proceedings is also tainted by error. The motion judge’s comment to
    the effect that in some cases, the mere existence of a family law proceeding
    prevents parties from moving forward with their lives could not be applied to
    this case without evidence that the respondent had been so affected. Although
    he gave evidence that the proceeding was stressful and he was relieved that it
    was over, he gave no evidence that he was unable to move on with his life if it
    continued. Indeed, during the litigation, his counsel had taken the position
    that his net worth, as disclosed on his Financial Statement, was so significant
    that he could afford any amount of support that would be ordered, and the only
    issue was entitlement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a

    that the motion be brought promptly was met. She made no finding that the
    respondent was entitled to rely on the security of the dismissal order under
    the principle of finality, by reason of the appellant’s delay in moving to set
    aside the dismissal. </span></a><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the “oppressive”
    nature of family law proceedings (to use the motion judge’s term) is not a
    prejudice caused by the dismissal and subsequent restoration of the proceeding.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Additionally, the motion judge stated that since
    no limitation period had expired, the appellant could, if she chose, start
    another proceeding. But she failed to address the significance of that: if a
    new proceeding could be brought, upholding the dismissal order would not remedy
    either fading memories or lack of closure for the parties, the impacts the
    motion judge referred to as arising from the passage of time.</span></p>

    the circumstances of the case must be considered in order to arrive at a just
    result.” Although she expressed her conclusion including the term “the
    circumstances”, she did not appropriately consider the circumstances as noted
    above. Nor did she expressly advert, in reaching her conclusions, to the policy
    that actions should be decided on their merits: <em>Fuller</em>, at paras. 23-26.
    Instead, she stressed that the timelines in the <em>Family Law Rules</em> “are
    in place for a reason”, and that even though the only prejudice was the passage
    of time, the appellant’s delay could not be countenanced.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge was entitled to consider that
    the <em>Family Law Rules</em> are in place for a reason, and that there was
    unexplained delay. But she was also obligated to consider that the <em>Family
    Law Rules</em> contemplate the setting aside of dismissal orders where it is
    just to do so, and that the factors and policies implicated in such a decision
    go beyond these considerations. She failed, as described above, to take into
    account the appropriate factors contextually, and then failed to consider
    whether the preferred policy of allowing actions to be determined on their
    merits should <span class=Underline>in this particular case</span> bow to
    considerations of timely administration of justice in accordance with the <em>Family
    Law Rules</em>. Furthermore, she did not explain how upholding the administrative
    dismissal given the ability to start a new proceeding was consistent with the
    goal of saving time and expense in accordance with the primary objective of the <em>Family Law Rules</em>: r. 2(3)(b).</span></p>

    and the dismissal order was not adequately explained, the appellant had the
    opportunity to get the application back on track in a manner contemplated by
    the <em>Family Law Rules</em>, by arranging a case conference or settlement
    conference. She lost that opportunity due to her lawyer’s inadvertence. It
    would not be just to visit that loss of opportunity on her. She moved promptly
    enough to set aside the dismissal order that her right to proceed with her
    claim ought not, in the circumstances, yield to what under other circumstances
    might be the respondent’s right to rely on the finality of the dismissal. There
    is no prejudice to the respondent and no basis to conclude that his fair trial

    for a Settlement Conference … and ask the Settlement Conference judge to
    schedule the case for trial as quickly as possible.” For the reasons above and
    in light of that undertaking, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of
    the motion judge, and replace it with an order setting aside the dismissal
    order and directing that within 30 days of the release of these reasons, the

    appeal proposed by my colleagues. In my view, there is no basis to interfere
    with the motion judge’s dismissal of Ms. Mihoren’s motion to set aside the
    October 26, 2019 administrative dismissal order (the “Dismissal Order”) of her
    application for spousal support.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;G.F.</em>, 2021 SCC 20, 71
    C.R. (7th) 1, the majority of the Supreme Court recalled, for the benefit of
    intermediate appellate courts, the importance of a functional and contextual
    reading of a lower court’s reasons and directed appellate courts to resist the
    temptation to finely parse a judge’s reasons in search of error: at para. 69.
    In my respectful view, my colleagues have run afoul of that direction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As my colleagues note, the motion judge’s order
    was discretionary and entitled to deference on appeal. My colleagues
    acknowledge that the motion judge accurately stated the applicable principles
    of law as set out in <em>H.B. Fuller Company v. Rogers (Rogers Law Office)</em>,
    2015 ONCA 173, 386 D.L.R. (4th) 262, and </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Reid v.
    Dow Corning Corp.</span></em><span lang=EN-US> (2001), 11 C.P.C. (5th) 80 (Ont.
    S.C.), rev’d on other grounds (2002), 48 C.P.C. (5th) 93 (Ont. Div. Ct.). </span><span
lang=EN-US>Nevertheless, they justify interfering with her order on the basis
    that the motion judge erred in applying those principles and failed to give the
    same weight to certain considerations as my colleagues would.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading2a>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge recognized and applied the overarching “big picture”
    principles</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Two of the alleged errors in principle
    identified by my colleagues are that the motion judge failed to contextually
    evaluate the <em>Reid </em>factors and failed to properly consider whether
    upholding the Dismissal Order would constitute a just result in all the
    circumstances. Since both alleged errors concern the “big picture” framework
    within which the motion judge was required to perform her analysis, I will
    consider them together.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I see no such errors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To my eye, my colleagues’ disagreement with the
    motion judge essentially stems from their different view of the significance of
    the litigation obligation the appellant failed to meet in this case, which
    resulted in the dismissal of her application. My colleagues open their reasons
    by stating: “The appellant missed a deadline, that her lawyer had neglected to
    diarize, by which certain steps had to be taken.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect, much more was involved than
    missing a mere deadline “by which certain steps had to be taken.” On this
    point, I regard the motion judge’s reasons as more realistically assessing the
    significance of the appellant’s litigation failure.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <em>Family Law Rules, O. Reg. 114/99,</em> take a more aggressive approach to “in and out of court” times for cases than
    do the somewhat somnambulant <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em> under which an
    administrative dismissal of a civil action is not triggered until the fifth
    anniversary of its commencement: <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194, r.&nbsp;48.14(1). By contrast, r. 41(5) of the <em>Family Law
    Rules</em> directs the issuance of a notice of approaching dismissal if a
    family law case “has not been settled, withdrawn or scheduled or adjourned for
    trial before the 365th day after the date the case was started”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge was alive to the policy of
    quicker “in and out of court” times chosen by the <em>Family Law Rules</em>. As
    she noted, at para. 17:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Rule 41(5) and (6) [of the <em>Family Law Rules</em>] puts an
    onus on family law litigants to move their cases forward in a timely manner. <span
class=Underline>The expectation is that the case will be resolved or scheduled
    for trial within one year.</span> If the litigants do not move their cases
    forward, and do not obtain a court order extending the timeline, the case will
    be administratively dismissed. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <em>Family Law Rules’</em> aggressive “in
    and out of court” timeline policy informed the motion judge’s understanding of
    the context and the “justice of the case” in which to consider the appellant’s
    request to revive her dismissed application. As the motion judge stated, at
    para. 15:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Family law cases are, by their very nature, time sensitive.
    They frequently involve children and issues respecting child support and
    residency. They often deal with families in crisis. Family law litigation is
    invasive and outstanding family law litigation is a heavy burden on the
    litigants, both financially and emotionally. I suspect that was the reason for
    the timelines set out in the <em>Family Law Rules</em>, O. Reg. 114/99.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the appellant failed to meet the <em>Family
    Law Rules’</em> fundamental expectation about the amount of time a family law
    case may tarry in the court system. She did not meet the expectation
    established by r. 41(5) that a case must be settled or scheduled for trial
    within one year of its commencement. The appellant then used r. 41(6)’s
    mechanism to avoid the dismissal of her application by consenting to the
    December 6, 2018 order that granted her leave to extend the time for dismissal
    of her case to October 25, 2019 (the “Consent Extension Order”). Her consent to
    that order was tantamount to an undertaking to settle, withdraw or set down her
    application for trial by October 25, 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant did not fulfill her undertaking.
    Instead, the evidence showed that the appellant and her counsel essentially
    ignored the Consent Extension Order, without explanation. The administrative
    dismissal of her application followed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the motion judge properly recognized
    that the appellant’s litigation failure was not missing a mere deadline “by
    which certain steps had to be taken.” Instead, the appellant failed to complete
    her application within the time stipulated by the <em>Family Law Rules</em>, as
    extended by her undertaking in the Consent Extension Order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the motion judge did not fail to
    “contextually evaluate the <em>Reid</em> factors”. She did not lose sight of
    rendering “a just result in all of the circumstances”. The motion judge was
    alive to the “big picture” context in which to apply the analytical elements
    identified in <em>Fuller </em>and <em>Reid</em> to a family law proceeding that
    has been dismissed for delay.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>My colleagues’ reasons essentially downplay the
    significance of the obligation that rr. 41(5) and (6) impose on family law
    litigants. “In and out of court” timelines, their reasons suggest, are quite
    secondary to deciding a case on the merits. In support, they point to comments
    that originated in this court’s decision in <em>Hamilton (City) v. Svedas
    Koyanagi Architects Inc.</em>, 2010 ONCA 887, 104 O.R. (3d) 689, where, at
    para. 20, this court quoted with approval the lower court’s comment that “[a]
    court’s bias is in favour of deciding matters on their merits rather than
    terminating rights on procedural grounds.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Much water has flowed under the
    access-to-justice-bridge since 2010. Chronic delays and disproportionate legal
    costs are now seen as barriers to a just civil and family court system in
    Ontario. The decisions in <em>Hryniak&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Mauldin</em>, 2014 SCC 7,
    [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87&nbsp;and <em>R. v. Jordan</em>, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R.
    631 have forced Ontario courts to rethink their traditional </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>laissez-faire </span></em><span lang=EN-US>attitude toward the time
    it takes to move cases from their start to a final disposition on the merits.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <em>Jordan</em>, the Supreme Court decried
    the “culture of complacency towards delay” that had emerged in the criminal
    justice system: at para. 40. An equally virulent culture of complacency towards
    delay is deeply embedded in Ontario’s civil and family justice systems. The
    presumptive “in and out of court in one year” baseline for family law cases
    created by r. 41(5) of the <em>Family Law Rules</em>, coupled with the limited
    exceptions to that baseline enumerated in r. 41(6), represents an effort to
    root out that culture of complacency in the family law system. That presumptive
    one-year “in and out of court” timeline provides the overarching context in
    which any motion judge must consider an applicant’s request to revive an
    administratively dismissed family law proceeding and determine what order would
    be just in all the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge’s reasons disclose that she
    identified and applied that overarching “big picture” context when considering
    the appellant’s motion to revive her dismissed application. The starting point
    of her analysis was faithful to the legislative scheme for family law
    proceedings. She did not make the errors in principle attributed to her by my
    colleagues.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading2a>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge was entitled to emphasize the appellant’s unexplained

lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>My colleagues contend that the motion judge
    failed to properly consider the appellant’s explanation for her failure to
    fulfill the Consent Extension Order. Instead, “[i]n effect, she ignored the
    significance of the fact that the deadline was missed due to lawyer
    inadvertence and treated the prior delay as the only relevant factor”: at para.
    46.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While my colleagues focus their analysis on the
    consequences (if any) of the failure of the appellant’s lawyer to diarize the
    completion date set by the Consent Extension Order, the motion judge’s reasons
    disclose that she undertook a much broader review of the record. That broader
    review led her to conclude that the appellant had not provided an acceptable
    explanation for her delay. Specifically, the motion judge took into account
    that:</span></p>
  <p class=ListNumber1CxSpFirst><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant failed to comply with her undertakings in anything
    resembling a timely manner. The appellant was provided with a list of her
    undertakings on November 2, 2018, yet “[s]he took no steps to comply with those
    undertakings until July or August of 2020.” The motion judge noted that the
    undertakings were straightforward and should have been answered relatively
    easily within 60 days of the completed examinations, but “[t]hey were not, and
    there is no explanation for the delay”;</p>
  <p class=ListNumber1CxSpMiddle><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant never brought the motion for better income disclosure that

  <p class=ListNumber1CxSpMiddle>iii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After her counsel’s letter of November 2018, the appellant took “no
    steps” to advance the litigation “until after the administrative dismissal
    order dated October 26, 2019. The applicant had already been granted an
    extension, yet did nothing in the ten months following”;</p>
  <p class=ListNumber1CxSpMiddle>iv.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s evidence that she met with her counsel in February 2019
    to discuss the case left the motion judge with more questions than answers as
    it did not explain why certain litigation tasks the appellant referred to were
    never completed; and</p>

    repeating his request for answers to undertakings, but his letter was ignored
    by the appellant and her counsel. As the motion judge stated: “There is no
    explanation for the failure to respond to [respondent’s counsel’s]
    correspondence of July 6, 2019”.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
lang=EN-US>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Those numerous failures led the motion judge to

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Only then did the motion judge assess the effect
    of the failure by the appellant’s lawyer’s assistant to diarize the ultimate
    dismissal date of October 25, 2019 set by the Consent Extension Order. While
    she accepted the assistant’s explanation of “inadvertence”, the motion judge
    quite properly pointed out that there was more to consider because “[t]he
    assistant does not provide an explanation as to why <span class=Underline>no
    real steps were taken in the almost 12 months</span> prior to the dismissal
    date” (emphasis added).</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the motion judge’s reasons disclose
    that the appellant’s failure involved more than a legal assistant neglecting to
    diarize one date, the conduct upon which my colleagues focus their attention.
    There was a much larger history of litigation delay by the appellant herself,
    as well as by her counsel and, most significantly, an absence of explanation
    from either for that larger delay.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That larger delay led the motion judge to make a
    telling finding of fact: “I&nbsp;conclude that the applicant simply did not
    move forward with her claim after the first order was made extending the
    timelines. She displayed … inertia, at best, or a complete lack of interest, at
    worst.” My colleagues do not take issue with that finding. Indeed, they cannot;
    it is firmly anchored in the evidence. This finding of fact played a large role
    in the motion judge’s overall analysis. The reason why it did can be found at para.
    33 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Under the <em>Family Law Rules</em>, once a case has already
    been extended by court order to a specific date, a new notice of approaching
    dismissal is not provided to the parties. In other words, they get one notice –
    the first time their case is on the brink of being dismissed. <span
class=Underline>If an order is made extending the timelines, they do not get a
    second notice. The parties, or their counsel, are required to ensure that they
    deal with the case prior to its dismissal on the date set out in the order</span>.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By giving that finding of fact significant
    weight in her analysis, the motion judge did not fall into reversible error. On
    the contrary, she was entitled to place more weight on that finding because, in

    no indication that evidence had been lost during the period of the appellant’s
    unexplained delay, she did presume that the passage of time would “somewhat”
    dim the recollection of witnesses. That strikes me as a common-sense
    presumption. My colleagues think otherwise, in large part because they measure
    the relevant delay to be only four months: from the time of the Dismissal Order
    to the time the appellant filed her motion to set aside. With respect, I think
    the more appropriate calculation of delay is over two years – from the start of
    the application to the date the motion was filed.</span></p>

    respondent’s evidence about the impact of the litigation on him, which was
    accepted by the motion judge, should play any role in the analysis because the
    respondent “gave no evidence that he was unable to move on with his life”: at
    para. 52.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I regard those differences between the motion

lang=EN-US>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>From her reasons, it is apparent the motion
    judge thought that the appellant’s lengthy delay and display of “inertia, at
    best, or a complete lack of interest, at worst” outweighed other factors. It
    was open to the motion judge to weigh the factors in that way; it was her
    discretionary call to make. That my colleagues might have exercised their
    discretion to call a strike a ball is not a basis for appellate reversal.</span></p>

    suggestion that usually the mere passage of time cannot constitute prejudice
    that weighs against reviving a dismissed proceeding. On the contrary, it can.

    the Ontario public timely justice, it must.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue of whether the passage of time <em>per
    se</em> constitutes prejudice recently arose in the context of motions to
    strike out civil jury notices. As I observed in a Chambers decision in <em>Louis
    v. Poitras</em>, 2020 ONCA 815, 8 C.C.L.I. (6th) 163, at para. 33:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Delay in obtaining a date for a civil jury trial can, by
    itself, constitute prejudice and justify striking out a jury notice. This
    should not be a surprising proposition. Part of the “service guarantee” to the
    public made in r. 1.04(1) is that courts will work to provide the “most
    expeditious … determination of <span class=Underline>every</span> civil
    proceeding on its merits” (emphasis added). Delay in providing trial dates
    undermines that service guarantee. The late Willard Z. Estey, a former justice
    of the Supreme Court of Canada, captured the point well when he stated that
    “delay in the settlement or disposal of conflicting claims is … a primary enemy
    of justice and peace in the community”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The recognition of delay <em>per se</em> as
    causing prejudice was accepted in the subsequent panel decision in <em>Louis v.
    Poitras</em>, 2021 ONCA 49, 456 D.L.R. (4th) 164, where Hourigan J.A. wrote, at
    para. 22:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he motion judge found that “the real and substantial
    prejudice arises simply by reason of delay”: at para. 46. I agree with the
    statement of Brown J.A. in his decision on the stay motion that this was a
    legally permissible finding and that “delay&nbsp;in obtaining a date for a
    civil jury trial can, by itself, constitute prejudice and justify striking out
    a jury notice.” As Brown J.A. notes, the whole <em>raison d’être</em> of the
    civil justice system, as captured in r. 1.04(1), is that courts will work to
    provide the “most expeditious…determination of every civil proceeding on its
    merits”: <em>Louis v. Poitras</em>, 2020 ONCA 815, at para. 33.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The prejudice caused by the mere passage of time
    is more pronounced where the issue arises in the context of a litigant’s
    failure to meet her <em>Rules</em>-imposed obligation to move her case “in and
    out of court” within a stipulated period of time. Under the <em>Family Law
    Rules</em>, “saving expense and time” is a component of the primary objective
    of dealing with a case justly: r. 2(3). The ability of the <em>Rules</em>-imposed
    “in and out of court” time obligations to promote that objective turns on the
    willingness of courts to enforce them. If courts do not treat the passage of
    time as a legitimate factor to take into account when deciding whether to
    revive an action dismissed for the failure to comply with “in and out of court”
    timelines, then one might as well tear up rr. 41(5) and (6). To remove the
    passage of time from the table of legitimate considerations would have the
    effect of eviscerating the <em>Rules</em>-imposed timeline obligations, feed
    the “culture of complacency towards delay” decried by <em>Jordan</em>, and
    reward negligent lawyers by freeing them from the risk of a claim on their
    professional liability insurance.</span></p>

  <p class=Heading>CONCLUSION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge gave reasons that correctly
    identified the applicable principles of law and explained why she weighed the
    different factors in the way that she did. Her reasons disclose she never lost
    sight of the “big picture” principles that provide the necessary framework for
    her analysis. Removed as we are at Osgoode Hall from the reality of managing
    the volume of cases in the family law trenches, we might be tempted to weigh
    some factors differently. But that is not our job. The task of weighing factors
    falls to the motion judge. In this case, she performed that task well, within
    the governing legal framework.</span></p>

    order was upheld which the motion judge overlooked, because the motion judge
    assumed the appellant could start another proceeding. The appellant suggested
    that a new proceeding could be met with an argument that a change in
    circumstances was required, or that it was an abuse of process. The respondent
    eschewed any reliance on a change in circumstances requirement for a new
    proceeding. At the same time, he reserved the right to argue that a new
    proceeding would be an abuse of process. Here, however, the motion judge
    expressly premised her decision on the recognition that “without the passage of
    a limitation period, the [appellant], should she choose to, can issue a new
    claim.” This given, I have difficulty seeing how the respondent could take
    advantage of the dismissal order, but then proceed to argue that a new
