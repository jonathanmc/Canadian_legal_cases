    on August 27, 2013, and the sentence imposed on October 16, 2015, by Justice Thomas
    J. Carey of the Superior Court of Justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Bradley Priestap, appeals his convictions on
    multiple counts of voyeurism, break and enter to commit voyeurism, possession
    of instruments for break and enter, and prowling on property at night. The
    events that gave rise to the charges occurred during several nights in August
    and September 2012 in a student housing neighbourhood near the campus of
    Western University. At sentencing the appellant was declared <span lang=EN-CA>a
    long-term offender.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was sentenced to serve nine years in
    custody followed by a ten-</span>year supervision order. Although his notice of
    appeal seeks leave to appeal from his sentence, before us the appellant
    abandoned his sentence appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant advances three main grounds of appeal </span>in
    respect of his convictions: (i) the trial judge failed to provide adequate
    reasons that were supported by the evidence; (ii) the trial judge erred by summarily
    dismissing “any notion that an alternate suspect could have been responsible
    for the crime<span lang=EN-CA>[</span>s<span lang=EN-CA>]</span>”; and (iii)
    ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the appellant’s submissions, we advised that it was
    not necessary to hear from the respondent and dismissed the appeal, with
    reasons to follow. These are those reasons.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Adequacy of reasons</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s challenge to the adequacy of the trial judge’s reasons
    combines (a) disagreement with some specific findings of fact, such as the
    similarity of the type of duct tape on the appellant’s camera with that found
    in his car <span lang=EN-CA>– together with a bag containing a black toque,
    flashlight, and screw driver – with (b) a complaint that the trial judge did
    not provide detailed reasons for why he rejected the appellant’s explanation
    about his presence in the student housing as it “bordered on laughable.</span>”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As stated in <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Vuradin</span></em>, <span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>2013 SCC 38,</span><span lang=EN-CA> </span>[2013] <span lang=EN-CA>2 </span>S.C.R. 639, at para. 15, “The core question in
    determining whether the trial judge’s reasons are sufficient is the following:
    Do the reasons, read in context, show why the judge decided as he did on the
    counts relating to the complainant?” When reasons are alleged to be
    insufficient, an appellate court must perform a functional and contextual
    reading of a trial judge’s reasons to assess whether the reasons, read in
    context and as a whole, in light of the live issues at trial, explain what the
    trial judge decided and why they decided that way in a manner that permits
    effective appellate review: <em><span lang=EN-CA>R.&nbsp;v. G.F.</span></em>,
    2021 SCC 20, <span lang=EN-CA>71 C.R. (7th) 1,</span> at para. 69.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the trial judge’s reasons explain what he decided
    and why. The reasons reveal that the trial judge relied on an accumulation of
    evidence to convict the appellant: the pattern of travel of the appellant’s
    vehicle recorded by a warrant-approved tracking device attached to the car; the
    observations of the officers who conducted surveillance of the appellant in the
    student housing area on the night of September 28, 2012; the arrest of the
    appellant that evening in that area; the photographs of partially clad female
    students found in the appellant’s camera; the duct tape that covered the flash
    on the appellant’s camera; the contents of the black bag seized from the
    appellant’s car pursuant to a warrant; and the description given by a female
    student of the person who had entered into her room when she was asleep.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As well, the trial judge spent considerable time in his reasons
    describing and assessing the appellant’s explanation for moving amongst various
    houses in the student area at night: namely, that he was looking for a friend
    named Rob or Rocco who previously had used his camera and must have been the
    person who took the photographs of the female students. In his reasons, the
    trial explained why he found “many parts of Mr. Priestap’s story” to be
    “ridiculous and an affront to common sense and intelligence” and, therefore,
    rejected it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was for the trial judge to assess the appellant’s credibility and we
    see nothing unreasonable in the conclusion he reached. Nor are we persuaded
    that the trial judge’s factual findings were tainted by palpable and overriding
    error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Alternate suspect</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to provide trial counsel with an
    opportunity to present the evidence of a third<span lang=EN-CA>-party</span>,
    or alternate, suspect.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record does not support this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Evidence of the possible involvement of a third party in the
    commission of an offence is admissible if there is a significant connection
    between the third party and the crime: <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Grandinetti</span></em>, <span lang=EN-CA>2005 SCC 5, </span>[2005] 1 S.C.R. 27, at paras. 46<span
lang=EN-CA>-47.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>As the respondent Crown accurately notes, the trial judge did allow
    the appellant to call evidence with respect to two proposed third-party
    suspects but did not permit such evidence in respect of a third individual. The
    conduct of the third individual was described in an April 27, 2013 newspaper
    article that trial counsel put to one of the investigating officers, P.C.
    Lipskey, during cross-examination</span>. The article described the activity of
    a young man who drove a car on to the Western University campus, would stop and
    ask for directions from a female student, invite the student into his car to
    show him how to reach his destination, and then proposition the student for
    sexual favours.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Officer
    Lipskey testified he was not familiar with the investigation into the activities
    described in the article, which was published about half a year after the
    appellant’s arrest. When trial counsel continued her questioning, the trial
    judge interjected and the following exchange took place:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>THE COURT: I’ll let you ask him about the
    other</span><span lang=EN-CA> </span><span lang=EN-CA>ones, but this is – are
    you suggesting anything that involves anything possibly sexual and University
    students is relevant, any investigation is relevant to this investigation?
    You’re talking about somebody propositioning people in cars. This is an investigation
    into break and enters and also, trespass and prowling by night and voyeurism
    while people are sleeping. Am I supposed to think that, first of all, the fact
    that offences are happening while an accused person is in custody, is not
    remarkable? There’s going to be all sorts of things happening, maybe this kind

    because it is of a sexual nature. It is on the Western University region. It’s
    while Mr. Priestap is in custody. I expect he’ll provide evidence and this may
    tie into that.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>THE COURT: Well the Officer has said he
    doesn’t know any – he doesn’t agree with you that it’s related. I, I don’t

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the lack of connection between the conduct of the driver of a car on the
    Western University campus and the night-time prowling and break and enter
    activity for which the appellant was charged, we see no error in the trial
    judge suggesting to counsel that it would be a waste of time to pursue further
    questioning about the investigation into the car driver.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Ineffective assistance of counsel</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant filed a lengthy affidavit alleging numerous deficiencies in the
    legal assistance provided to him by trial counsel, in his factum he relies on
    two allegations of ineffective assistance: (i) his counsel did not properly
    prepare him for trial, specifically by failing to ask the appellant that he was
    aware of the police presence in the student area at all times and was in the
    area at other times; and (ii) his counsel failed to bring a <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em> application to exclude any and all police
    observations of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    accept the Crown’s submission that the appellant has failed to demonstrate that
    trial counsel’s alleged competence prejudiced the appellant’s right to a fair
    trial: <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Garofoli</span></em> (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d)
    97 (Ont. C.A.), at <span lang=EN-CA>p</span>. 15<span lang=EN-CA>2, rev’d on
    other grounds, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421</span>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of counsel’s alleged failure to ask the two questions, the appellant
    has not demonstrated how any answers he might have given would have impacted
    the result. We agree with the Crown that the trial judge’s strong finding against
    the appellant’s credibility casts a pall over his attempt before us, in effect,
    to reconstruct an innocent explanation for his presence in the student
    residence area on the nights in question.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of a <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em> application that was
    never brought, we accept the Crown’s submission that the appellant has not
    presented a proper record on this appeal to enable this court to evaluate his <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em> claims nor has he demonstrated that the result
    would have been different had such an application been litigated.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no merit in this ground of appeal.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
