  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After receiving an alert that on May 28, 2017
    child pornography had been transmitted from an identified Internet Protocol
    address (“IP address”) using a Skype file sharing program, Toronto Police
    obtained a search warrant for the residential address associated with that IP
    address. The residence was owned by JT’s parents. When the search warrant was
    executed on November 16, 2017, JT was discovered holding a computer tablet that
    belonged to him. A commercial movie was playing in full screen. A separate
    application containing child pornography was also opened on the computer
    tablet. Although the child pornography was not immediately visible on the
    screen, it could readily and easily be accessed because it was already opened.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Det. Cst. Kidd of the Sex Crimes Unit, who was
    present at the time of the search, determined that the IP address at the
    residence had changed since the May 28, 2017 transmission.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the days that followed, a forensic
    examination of the computer tablet was conducted with the aid of forensic
    software that categorizes and analyzes images and videos. The images of child
    pornography that had been transmitted on May&nbsp;28,&nbsp;2017 were found on
    the device. Additional images of child pornography were located in the
    downloaded document files. The downloaded document files also contained
    documents that could be linked circumstantially to JT, and his user account and
    his email address were linked to the computer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>JT was charged with several child pornography
    offences on a four count information. He was tried and convicted of possessing
    child pornography and making child pornography available. He appeals those
    convictions on two grounds, arguing: (1) that the trial judge erred by
    admitting expert evidence from Det. Cst. Kidd relating to the downloading of
    files without qualifying Det. Cst. Kidd as an expert (the “qualification
    error”); and (2) that the trial judge committed a <em>Sekhon </em>error,
    contrary to <em>R. v. Sekhon</em>, 2014 SCC 15, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 272, by
    admitting and relying on anecdotal evidence from Det. Cst. Kidd (the “<em>Sekhon </em>error”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the end of the oral hearing, we dismissed
    JT’s appeal for reasons to follow. These are our reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The alleged “qualification error” relates to the
    admission of testimony by Det.&nbsp;Cst. Kidd, who was not qualified as an
    expert witness, that an IP address will change if the computer is disconnected
    from and then reconnected to the computer network. We are not persuaded that
    this testimony required expertise. This was mundane factual evidence about the
    operation of internet services that did not require specialized knowledge to
    observe or understand. Moreover, the parties agreed that no issue was taken
    with Det. Cst. Kidd’s “ability to speak to the contents of the computer and the
    forensic analysis of the computer, as it pertains to the activities on their
    computer … as it relates to the child pornography”, and no objection was taken
    to the evidence. We therefore dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The alleged <em>Sekhon </em>error relates to the
    admission and use by the trial judge of testimony from Det. Cst. Kidd that in
    his experience he had never seen child pornography end up on a computer in an
    automatic fashion, without having been placed there by user action. The trial
    judge relied on this evidence in rejecting JT’s suggestion that some of the
    documents could have been placed automatically into the downloads folder on the
    tablet.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We are not persuaded that a <em>Sekhon </em>error
    occurred. Det. Cst. Kidd was not offering unnecessary and irrelevant anecdotal
    testimony about the guilt of other similarly situated offenders to support a
    finding that JT was also guilty of possessing or making available child
    pornography. When his impugned testimony is read in context, it is clear that
    Det. Cst. Kidd was simply relying on his experience to explain the technical
    operation of computers, specifically, that documents are not automatically
    downloaded by computers, but by human action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor did this evidence reverse the burden of
    proof by requiring JT to show that his state of mind or conduct was different
    than the state of mind or conduct of other alleged offenders. As indicated,
    Det. Cst. Kidd’s evidence related to the technical operation of computers and
    did not purport to speak directly to the elements of the offence, as was the
    case in <em>Sekhon</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor do we agree with the submission made on JT’s
    behalf that there would be no realistic way to counter this evidence other than
    by searching for and calling competing anecdotal evidence from an investigator
    who had experienced the automatic downloading of documents onto a computer. If
    it is true that Det. Cst. Kidd was incorrect and there are indeed ways that
    documents can automatically be downloaded onto a computer, any admissible
    technical evidence relating to the operation of computers could have been called
    to challenge his testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal is therefore dismissed.</span></p>
