    the applicant requested bail pending his application for leave to appeal; and second,
    in the alternative, he relied on s. 65.1 of the <em>Supreme Court Act</em><i> </i>and

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Section 679, when read in context of the <i>Code</i>s
    entire bail regime, is inapplicable to a person, such as the applicant, who is
    awaiting trial. Section 679, when read in context and given its plain
    grammatical meaning, applies to a person who has been convicted and allows this
    court to release them from custody pending the determination of an appeal of
    conviction and/or sentence. <u>Section 679(1)(c) does not provide a route to
    have a single judge of this court review a decision of this court made under s.

    decline to do so, as doing so would circumvent the statutory scheme of judicial
    release</u>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    7 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Courts of Justice Act</span></em>, <span
lang=EN-CA>R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43,</span> determines the composition of this

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span

lang=EN-CA>As discussed below, an order of a single judge of this court under
    s. 679(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is properly reviewable by a panel of
    the court under s. 680 of the <i>Code</i>, which the applicant has not invoked,
    rather than under the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>. But more fundamentally, s.
    679(1)(c) does not have any application in a case such as this, in which the
    applicant is seeking to be released on bail while he attempts to appeal to the
    Supreme Court of Canada from an order of this court that he be detained pending
    trial. Accordingly, the power in s. 7(5) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> is
    of no assistance to the applicant to the extent he founds his request for
    relief on s. 679(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>While s. 7(5) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act </i>gives this panel
    the power to review Juriansz J.A.s decision as it relates to a stay of the
    October 2020 Order, in our view there is no basis to set aside or vary his
    decision. <i> </i></span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Martin
    J.s order makes no reference to s. 679(1)(c). This is significant because, as
    part of his November 2020 Application before that Court, the applicant
    requested alternative relief  that the Court remand the case to this court to
    consider the applicability of s. 679(1)(c). Martin J. did not do so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    if the applicant were correct in his submission that Juriansz J.A. erred in
    finding that s. 679(1)(c) is inapplicable, his avenue of review would not fall
    under s. 7(5) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Courts of Justice Act</span></em>: it
    would fall under s. 680 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em>.
    Section 680 provides that orders made under s. 679 may be reviewed by a panel on
    the direction of the chief justice or acting chief justice of the court of
    appeal. This is the case even though Juriansz J.A. found that he had no
    jurisdiction to entertain the s. 679 application: see <em><span lang=EN-CA>R.
    v. Stoltz</span></em> (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 422 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 428. The prospect
    of this taking place  a panel review (under s. 680) of a single judges decision
    concerning bail pending leave to appeal (under s. 679(1)(c)) of a previous
    panels bail decision (under s. 680)  demonstrates the untenability of the
    applicants position that s. 679(1)(c) has any application in these
    circumstances.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> We
    agree with Juriansz J.A.s conclusion that s. 679(1)(c) does not apply in this
    case. The section provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>679(1) A judge of the court of appeal may, in accordance with
    this section, release an appellant from custody pending the determination of
    his appeal if, </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(a) in the case of an appeal to the court of appeal against
    conviction, the appellant has given notice of appeal or, where leave is required,
    notice of his application for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 678;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(b) in the case of an appeal to the court of appeal against
    sentence only, the appellant has been granted leave to appeal; or</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(c) <u>in the case of an appeal or an application for leave
    to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the appellant has filed and served
    his notice of appeal or, where leave is required, his application for leave to
    appeal</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considered
    without context, s. 679(1)(c) could be read as encompassing an application for
    leave to appeal from a court of appeals denial of bail under s. 680. But, as
    Juriansz J.A. concluded, that is not what s. 679 is designed to achieve. As
    with the rest of the section, and consistent with Part XXI (Appeals 
    Indictable Offences) as a whole, s. 679(1)(c) applies to bail pending appeal
    from conviction and/or sentence; not from a bail decision under s. 680. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant essentially asserts a right to bail pending a bail review (or in this
    case, an application for leave to appeal from the denial of bail). This concept
    is alien to all of the bail review provisions throughout the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em>. The applicants suggested application of
    s. 679(1)(c) puts a single judge (and a reviewing panel) in the untenable
    position of having to explicitly endorse or reject the underlying detention
    order that is the subject of proceedings in the Supreme Court of Canada. It
    will be for that Court, not a single judge or panel of this court, to determine
    whether this courts order under s. 680 should stand; that is, whether the
    applicant should be released on bail pending his trial.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicants request for a review of the decision under s. 679(1)(c) is

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    more challenging question is whether this court may exercise the power in s.
    65.1 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Supreme Court Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span>to in effect grant bail in a criminal proceeding. Section 65.1 provides
    that this court may order a stay of proceedings against one of its own judgments
    when a party has served and filed a notice of application for leave to appeal the
    judgment at issue. The stay of proceedings sought by the applicant from
    Juriansz J.A. in this case was the equivalent of a release order. Indeed, the
    applicant sought, and still seeks, through a stay of the October 2020 Order, to
    restore Goodman J.s order. But as discussed below, there is a very real
    practical hurdle to achieving this result. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Relying
    on the order of Martin J., the applicant submits that his requested relief is
    achievable through the application of s. 683(3) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal
    Code</span></em>, which provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) A court of appeal may exercise, in relation to proceedings
    in the court, any powers not mentioned in subsection (1) that may be exercised
    by the court on appeals in civil matters, and may issue any process that is
    necessary to enforce the orders or sentences of the court, but no costs shall
    be allowed to the appellant or respondent on the hearing and determination of
    an appeal or on any proceedings preliminary or incidental thereto.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant contends that this section equips this court with the authority to
    order a stay of proceedings under s. 65.1 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Supreme
    Court Act</span></em>. That section provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>65.1 (1) The Court, the court appealed from or a judge of
    either of those courts may, on the request of the party who has served and
    filed a notice of application for leave to appeal, order that proceedings be
    stayed with respect to the judgment from which leave to appeal is being sought,
    on the terms deemed appropriate.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2) The court appealed from or a judge of that court may
    exercise the power conferred by subsection (1) before the serving and filing of
    the notice of application for leave to appeal if satisfied that the party
    seeking the stay intends to apply for leave to appeal and that delay would
    result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) The Court, the court appealed from or a judge of either of
    those courts may modify, vary or vacate a stay order made under this section.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the applicant observes, this provision has been applied in proceedings under
    the <em><span lang=EN-CA>National Defence Act</span></em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5
    to address the question of bail pending proceedings in the Supreme Court of
    Canada. Although that Act provides for bail pending the appeal of proceedings
    in the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada (CMAC) (see ss. 248.1 to 248.4),
    the CMAC has no jurisdiction to order judicial interim release of a convicted
    person pending his or her appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada: see <em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Stillman</span></em>, 2019 CMAC 1, at para. 3; <em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Royes</span></em>, 2016 CMAC 3, 338 C.C.C. (3d) 183, at paras.
    16-17, leave to appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 324. Nonetheless, in both
    of these cases, Bell C.J. applied the well-known criteria in <em><span
lang=EN-CA>RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</span></em>, [1994]
    1 S.C.R. 311, to the stay provision under s. 65.1 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Supreme
    Court Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span>to determine whether it was appropriate
    to stay the imposition of the offenders sentence, thereby granting a remedy
    similar to judicial interim release. See also <em><span lang=EN-CA>T.(M.) v. A.(H.)</span></em>,
    [1995] 1 S.C.R. 445, at paras. 4-5, in which Sopinka J. relied upon s. 65.1 of
    the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Supreme Court Act</span></em> to release an applicant
    in the context of civil contempt, in circumstances where s. 679 of the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span>arguably did not
    apply.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is nothing in s. 65.1 that expressly excludes a detention order from the
    category of judgments that may be stayed. However, we agree with the Crown,
    that given the grounds that justify a detention order pending trial in s.
    515(10) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em>, it is not
    particularly clear how the <em><span lang=EN-CA>RJR-MacDonald</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> </span>criteria are to be applied, especially the factor of where
    the balance of convenience may lie.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    need not, however, explore this issue any further. The applicants request to
    Juriansz J.A. was to stay this courts October 2020 Order, enabling him to be
    re-released on the terms ordered by Goodman J. However, the applicant is no
    longer able to meet a critical part of this order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Goodman
    J. released the applicant after this court upheld Parayeski J.s detention
    order. Goodman J.s decision was based on changed circumstances, including a
    new release plan. As Goodman J. said, at para. 122:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><u>I confess that this decision is a close call.</u> In adding the
    COVID-19 pandemic into the proposed release plan's &quot;mix&quot;, as expressed
    in the recent jurisprudence, along with some diminution to the strength of the prosecution's
    case, I am persuaded that the applicant has met his onus<u>. In my opinion, the
    decidedly restrictive release plan proffered by the applicant will address the Crown's
    primary and secondary ground concerns</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to naming the applicants father a surety, Goodman J. also named two
    further sureties  ErT and EIT  in the amount of $300,000: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em>, s. 515(2.1). These sureties were
    cross-examined at the bail hearing. Their sufficiency was challenged by the
    Crown. Goodman J. assessed their evidence in the following way, at para. 81:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><u>While the two principal sureties seemed sincere, I tend to agree
    with the Crown that both ErT and ElT came across as somewhat naïve in their understanding
    of the applicant's entire situation</u>. That being said, they testified as to their
    willingness to assist with the plan, why there is a substantial monetary pledge
    in support and why they did not present themselves earlier as potential sureties. <u>Overall, I find both ErT and ElT to be well-meaning, credible and up to the
    challenge of supervising J.A.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> We
    were advised by the parties that ErT and EIT are no longer able to serve as
    sureties. The applicant has proposed two new sureties in the same amount 
    $300,000. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the applicant acknowledges that this turn of events is less than ideal;
    however, she submits that, under s. 65.1 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Supreme
    Court Act</span></em>, this court may impose a stay on the terms deemed
    appropriate. We cannot accept this submission. The two named sureties were
    integral to Goodman J.s order, as reflected in the passages quoted in paras.
    29 and 30, above. Moreover, Goodman J. ordered that the applicant live with ErT
    and ElT while he was out on bail. The substitution of new sureties in these
    circumstances goes well beyond the imposition of terms deemed appropriate in
    s. 65.1(1) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Supreme Court Act</span></em>. It would
    involve a significant refashioning of Goodman J.s order in a decision that he
    characterized as a close call. </p>
