    J. is their daughter. She was four years old at the time of the relevant

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In June 2017, the police executed a search
    warrant on the appellants’ apartment in Toronto. The search warrant was
    unrelated to the offences which are the subject of this appeal. The apartment
    was appallingly filthy and J.’s personal hygiene was equally bad. The police
    took J. and turned her over to the child welfare authorities.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants were charged with the failure to provide
    J. with the necessaries of life contrary to s. 215(2)(a)(i), and with forcibly
    confining J. contrary to s. 279(2) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46</span></em>. On the failure
    to provide necessaries charge, the Crown alleged the appellants’ failure to
    attend to J.’s personal hygiene, coupled with the very unsanitary conditions in
    the apartment, put J.’s health and safety at risk, and demonstrated a marked
    departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent parent. On the unlawful
    confinement charge, the Crown alleged the appellants effectively locked J. in
    the filthy bedroom at night. The Crown maintained, that in doing so, the
    appellants went well beyond the “lawful authority” defence in s. 279(2) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown proceeded summarily. The trial judge

    Superior Court. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge (the “SCAJ”) allowed
    the appeals and quashed the acquittals of both C.O. and N.P. She entered
    convictions against both on the necessaries of life charge and ordered a new
    trial on the unlawful confinement charge.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE FACTS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the police entered the appellants’
    apartment they found partially eaten food throughout the apartment and cigarettes
    and garbage all over the living room floor. Some of the closets were full of bags
    containing garbage. The apartment reeked of urine and feces. There were flies
    everywhere and the walls were covered with fly feces.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.’s bedroom was particularly dirty. Her pillow and
    her bed smelled of urine. There was food on the mattress and insects buzzing
    around the food. The police found urine and feces on J.’s bedroom floor and a
    pile of old feces in her closet. J.’s pants were wet with urine and covered in
    grime. She was so dirty she had to be bathed before she could be medically
    examined. One of the officers testified that it was “impossible to breathe” in
    J.’s bedroom because the stench was so overpowering.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence did not show exactly how long J.
    had been living in the conditions observed by the police when they executed the
    search warrant. The trial judge did, however, accept the evidence that the
    conditions in the apartment, 11 days before the warrant was executed, were much
    the same as the conditions at the time the warrant was executed. There was also
    some evidence the appellants and J. had lived in very unsanitary conditions at another
    residence, about two or three years earlier.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A psychologist who prepared a report for the
    Children’s Aid Society about four months after J.’s apprehension described J.’s
    cognitive functioning and motor skills as within the average range. J. showed
    lower levels of self-regulation and adaptive functioning as well as poor
    socialization. Her hyperactivity, impulsivity, and distractibility suggested
    she was at risk to develop an attention deficit disorder.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is unclear whether the psychologist was aware
    of the extremely unsanitary conditions in J.’s home. In any event, he was not
    asked to offer any opinion as to what effect, if any, those conditions had on J.’s
    psychological status. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.’s great-grandfather described J. as a bubbly,
    energetic and happy child before her apprehension by the authorities. He had
    been in the appellants’ apartment about four months before the police executed
    the search warrant. He described the apartment as “untidy”. He also indicated
    that whenever he saw J. she seemed clean and well dressed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.’s great-grandfather assumed custody of J. sometime
    after she was apprehended by the child welfare authorities. He took steps to improve
    her socialization and her interpersonal skills. She was diagnosed with ADHD
    after she started to live with her great-grandfather. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the police executed the warrant they found J.’s
    bedroom door closed. The doorknob on J.’s bedroom was attached by a rope to the
    doorknob on the bathroom across the hall. The rope prevented J. from opening
    her door from the inside. J’s inability to open her bedroom door when the rope

    trial judge accepted that the appellants confined J. in her bedroom. He recognized
    that the confinement of a child by a parent was justified if the confinement
    was “in accordance with the best interests of the child”: <em>R. v. Magoon</em>,

    out of the state of J.’s personal hygiene and the extremely unsanitary
    conditions in the apartment. It was common ground that the appellants owed a legal
    duty under s. 215(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> to provide J. with the
    necessaries of life. The Crown alleged the appellants’ failure to attend to
    J.’s personal hygiene needs, and to maintain even minimally sanitary conditions
    in the apartment, constituted a failure to provide the necessaries of life,
    leaving J. in “destitute or necessitous circumstances”. The Crown further maintained
    that leaving four-year-old J. in a filthy room over many days demonstrated a
    marked departure from what a reasonable parent would do.</span></p>

    of harm to J. The trial judge noted the Crown had led no evidence that J. was
    either harmed by the unsanitary living conditions or that those conditions
    created a risk of harm to J. The trial judge declined the Crown’s invitation to
    take judicial notice that living in the extremely unsanitary conditions in the

    determinative on the unlawful confinement charge. She said, at para. 64:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>While the reason behind confining J. was

    essential element of a charge under s. 215(2)(a)(i): Reasons, at para. 26.
    Second, if proof of some risk of harm was required, the trial judge erred in failing
    to consider the risk of psychological harm to J.: Reasons, at paras. 49-50.
    Third, the trial judge erred in holding he needed evidence quantifying the
    degree of risk to J. posed by the extremely unsanitary environment in which she
    was living: Reasons, at paras. 56-57. The SCAJ concluded that even if, contrary
    to her conclusion, the Crown was required to prove the conditions posed a risk
    of harm to the child, the trial judge’s finding that the conditions were

    trial judge’s finding that the appellants locked J. in her bedroom at night to
    prevent her from getting into the dangerous cleaning products kept in other
    parts of the apartment. Counsel submits that it was open to the trial judge to
    accept the appellants’ explanation, and to find, based on that explanation, that
    the appellants restricted J.’s liberty to protect her health and safety. The
    appellants therefore acted within the “lawful authority” defence in s. 279(2).</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal, as it relates to the unlawful
    confinement convictions, can be resolved by addressing the argument that once
    the trial judge accepted the appellants’ evidence that they had confined J. to
    protect her health and safety, the confinement was lawful and it was
    unnecessary to consider the conditions of the confinement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The “lawful authority” defence at s. 279(2) in
    cases involving parents and their children recognizes that parents are entitled,
    if not obligated, by virtue of their parental duties and responsibilities to
    confine their children in the best interests of the children. The “lawful
    authority” defence however extends only to conduct which is a reasonable
    exercise of parental authority done in furtherance of parental duties and
    responsibilities. Parental conduct that is abusive, harmful to the child, degrading
    or otherwise beyond the bounds of acceptable parenting cannot shelter under the
    “lawful authority” defence: <em>Magoon</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at paras. 64-68; <em>R. v. Bottineau</em>, 2006 O.J. No. 1864 (Ont. S.C.), at

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It flows from the focus on the reasonableness of
    the parental exercise of authority that the “lawful authority” defence in s.
    279(2) as applied in the parent/child situation must address not only the
    reason behind the confinement but also the factual context in which the
    confinement occurs. The court must consider the purpose, nature, and extent of
    the confinement in determining whether that confinement was a lawful exercise
    of parental authority over the child: <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Kematch,</em> 2010
    MBCA 18, 252 C.C.C. (3d) 349, at para. 104.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parents’ reason for imposing the restraint
    on the child’s liberty will obviously be a key consideration. It is not however,
    the only relevant consideration. Other factors such as the location, manner,
    and duration of the confinement will also be potentially relevant, as no doubt
    will other considerations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the SCAJ that the conditions of the
    room in which the appellants confined J. was relevant to whether the
    confinement was lawful. J.’s room was the dirtiest room in a very dirty
    apartment. There is an obvious difference when measuring the legitimacy of the exercise
    of parental authority, between confining a young child at night in a “normal”
    bedroom in which the child routinely sleeps and confining that same child in that
    same room when the room has become more akin to a garbage can or a toilet than
    a bedroom.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A trier of fact could well conclude, even if the
    appellants acted out of legitimate concern for J.’s safety, that locking her in
    a filthy, foul-smelling room, replete with human feces, decaying foods, and countless
    flies, was harmful, degrading and well beyond the bounds of acceptable
    parenting. The appellants’ failure to attend to J.’s personal hygiene while she
    was locked in her room only added to the degrading nature of the confinement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    whether the Crown had to prove a risk of harm to J. to establish an offence
    under s. 215(2)(a)(i). For the reasons that follow, I agree with the trial judge
    – risk of harm is an element of the offence. Indeed, on a close analysis of the
    elements of the offence in s. 215(2)(a)(i), it is plain that risk of harm as a
    consequence of the parents’ dereliction of duty is woven throughout the conduct
    and fault requirements of that offence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 215 is found in the part of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> headed “Duties Tending to Preservation of Life”. Among the duties
    identified in s. 215 is the obligation on a parent to provide the necessaries
    of life to a child: <em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 215(1)(a). The duty placed on
    parents – to provide the necessaries of life to their children – is intended to
    protect children under the charge of their parents. It requires parents to protect
    children from the harm to their health and safety associated with the failure
    to provide the necessaries of life to children. Clearly, the duty puts a
    positive obligation on parents to act to protect their children from harm. The
    duty is reinforced by criminal sanctions for the failure to perform the duty in
    some circumstances. As I will explain, protection of children from harm in the
    context of the duty created by s. 215(1)(a) must include protection of children
    from the risk of harm associated with the failure to provide necessaries: see <em>R.

    for a parent, who owes a duty to provide the necessaries of life to a child
    under 16, to fail to perform that duty, if the child is in “destitute or
    necessitous circumstances”.</span></p>

    (i), the offence under subsection (ii) requires proof of the duty to provide
    the necessaries of life and proof of the failure to perform that duty.

    way. Under subsection (i), the Crown must prove the child was in “destitute or

    life. Under the offence created by subsection (ii), the Crown must prove that
    the failure to provide the necessaries of life led to one of the three consequences

    depends, to some extent, on the specific circumstances. “Necessaries of life”
    capture those things which are integral to the health and safety of the child.
    Some specifics, like food, are self-evidently “necessaries of life”. Other
    things, like protection of children from physical harm, are also necessaries of

    reference to those things necessary to protect a child from harm to the child’s
    health or safety must include protection from <em>risk of that harm</em> if the
    section’s protective purpose is to be served. A reading of the phrase
    “necessaries of life” that triggered the obligation to provide necessaries only
    after harm had occurred to the child, would neuter much of the protective
    purpose of the duty created by s. 215(1)(a). On this view, a parent’s duty to protect
    the child from harm would arise only after the parent’s failure to act had
    caused harm to the child. The protection would come too late for the child. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The duty to protect, which underlies the duty to
    provide the necessaries of life, does not demand that a parent protect a child
    from risk of all harms, no matter how minor or speculative. The harm in
    question must be reasonably foreseeable in the circumstances. One cannot
    meaningfully talk of a duty to protect from a harm in the absence of any
    reasonable basis to conclude there is at least a risk of that harm. The harm
    must also relate to the child’s ongoing health and safety, and not merely the
    child’s comfort or wellbeing. The duty imposed by s. 215(1)(a) is not to be the
    ideal parent. If the foreseeable harm to the child is minor and transitory, a
    failure to protect against that harm will not constitute a failure to provide
    the necessaries of life.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> The third element of the conduct component of s.
    215(2)(a)(i) requires that the Crown demonstrate that the child was in “destitute
    or necessitous circumstances” when the parent failed to provide protection from
    harm. The words “destitute or necessitous” must mean more than a child who has
    not been provided with the necessaries of life. Otherwise, the requirement that
    the child be in “destitute or necessitous circumstances” would add nothing. The
    offence would consist solely of failing to provide the necessaries of life. On
    the language of s. 215, a parent’s failure to provide the necessaries of life,
    standing alone, is clearly not a crime. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is relatively little authority on the
    meaning of the phrase “destitute or necessitous circumstances”: see <em>S.J.</em>,
    at para. 56. Both words refer to the child’s condition when the parent fails in
    the duty to provide the necessaries of life. Both words refer to a child who is
    in need of the necessary that was not provided by the parent. The child’s need is
    assessed by the impact of the failure to provide that necessary on the child’s health
    and safety. If the failure to provide the alleged necessary harms the child’s
    health or safety, or puts the child’s health or safety at risk, it can be said the
    child is in need of protection from that harm, and therefore in “destitute or necessitous
    circumstances”: see <em>S.J.</em>, at para. 64.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I accept there is an overlap in subsection (i)
    between the definition of “necessaries of life” and the condition of being “in
    destitute or necessitous circumstances”. This overlap makes it somewhat
    difficult to parse out the separate elements of the conduct prohibited by
    subsection (i). However, given that neither offence in s. 215(2) makes it a
    crime to fail to provide the necessaries of life without more, the duty of the
    parent to provide the necessaries of life must be addressed separately from the
    further requirement that the child be in “destitute or necessitous
    circumstances”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Even though the two elements must be considered
    separately, I would think that, in most cases, a child who is not provided with
    a necessary of life will be in necessitous circumstances. There may, however,
    be situations in which a parent has failed to provide a necessary, but that failure
    has not resulted in the child being harmed or facing the risk of harm. For
    example, a parent may fail to provide a child with food over several days.
    However, the child may be old enough, and have sufficient resources and
    independence, to attend to her own food needs. In those circumstances, while the
    parent has failed to provide a necessary of life, the child is not harmed or at
    risk of harm as a consequence of that failure. Consequently, the child is not in
    “destitute or necessitous circumstances”.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

    directly from a determination that J. had not been provided with the
    necessaries of life to a further finding that she was in necessitous

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Section 215(2)(a)(i) addresses the situation
    in which the parents’ failure to perform their duties under s. 215(1)(a) puts
    the child to whom the duty is owed at risk of harm because of the child’s dire
    circumstances (destitute or necessitous).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The SCAJ described the above passage as
    referable to “the purpose” of the offence creating provisions in s. 215(2).
    With respect, in this part of her reasons, Pepall J.A. was identifying the
    elements of the two offences and differentiating between the elements required
    by each offence. Her description of “necessitous circumstances”, as referable
    to a child who was “at risk of harm”, was a description of the essential
    element of the offence under subsection (i), which differentiated that offence
    from the offence under subsection (ii). The SCAJ was obliged to accept and
    apply the interpretation of the elements of the offence created by subsection
    (i), provided by Pepall J.A.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The SCAJ also rejected the submission that risk
    of harm was implicit in the requirement of “necessitous circumstances” because,
    in her view, that interpretation would make s. 215(2)(a)(i) “somewhat
    redundant”: Reasons, at para. 39. The SCAJ viewed the requirement that the
    Crown prove risk of harm to the child under subsection (i) as being very
    similar to the requirement in subsection (ii) that the Crown prove one of the three
    consequences identified in that provision. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I cannot agree. The offence created by
    subsection (ii) speaks to specific identified consequences to the child. Those
    consequences are all potentially different from, and more serious than, the
    risk to the child’s health or safety required to show “necessitous
    circumstances”. I see no difficulty distinguishing between the two offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The SCAJ also rejected the trial judge’s
    interpretation of “necessitous circumstances”, in part, because she read the
    trial judge as requiring that the Crown prove the circumstances were “extremely
    serious” before the child could be said to be in “necessitous circumstances”:
    Reasons, at paras. 32-35. With respect, the SCAJ misread the trial judge’s
    reasons. He rejected an interpretation of serious harm in favour of one that
    would require the Crown to prove some risk of harm: Reasons, at paras. 49-55. The
    SCAJ’s misreading of the trial judge’s reasons may explain why the SCAJ saw the
    trial judge’s interpretation as creating a significant overlap or redundancy in
    the two offences created by s. 215(2).</span></p>

    reus</em>) of the offence, the Crown is also required to prove a fault
    component (<em>mens rea</em>). The Supreme Court of Canada has fashioned a constitutionally-compliant
    level of objective conduct-based fault premised on a comparison, using the “marked
    departure” metric, between the accused’s conduct and the conduct of a reasonably
    prudent parent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The approach to fault finding under s. 215(2)(a)
    is set out by Lamer C.J. in <em>R. v. Naglik</em>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122, at p.
    143. That case involved a charge under s. 215(2)(a)(ii). The Chief Justice
    described the fault component in these terms:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Section 215(2)(a)(ii) punishes a marked
    departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent parent in circumstances where
    it was objectively foreseeable that the failure to provide the necessaries of

    endangerment to health, of the child.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Adapting the language of Lamer C.J. to the
    offence created by s. 215(2)(a)(i), the fault component consists of conduct
    which shows a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent parent in
    circumstances in which it was objectively foreseeable the child was in
    “necessitous circumstances”. That is, circumstances in which the child’s health
    or safety were at risk and the child was in need of protection. The requirement
    that the Crown prove, as part of the harm element, that it was reasonably
    foreseeable to a prudent parent that the child was in need of protection,
    dictates that there must be some foreseeable risk of harm. Foreseeable risk of
    harm is, therefore, integral to the fault requirement for the offences created
    by s. 215(2)(a). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    or safety informs both the scope of the duty to provide the necessaries of life
    in a given circumstance, and the child’s need for those necessaries.
    Furthermore, the objective fault requirement inevitably leads to a risk
    assessment on the way to determining whether the accused conduct constituted a
    marked departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent parent in the same circumstances. </span></p>

    years old. The trial judge should have taken judicial notice that a young child,

    think J. would not have continued to live in these conditions. In considering
