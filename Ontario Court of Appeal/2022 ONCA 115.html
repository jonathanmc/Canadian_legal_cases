  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2007, Dara Fresco started a class action
    against the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on behalf of 31,000 customer
    service employees who had worked for the Bank between 1993 and 2009. She claimed
    that two of the Bank’s policies enabled it to permit its employees to work
    overtime hours without appropriate compensation, contrary to the</span><em><span
lang=EN-CA> Canada Labour Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Two competing narratives set the scene. The Bank
    argued that its policies aimed to stop unnecessary overtime in order to control
    costs and to prevent overwork. To the contrary, Ms. Fresco argues that these
    policies resulted in the Bank getting the economic value of overtime work
    without compensating employees as required by the Code. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first overtime policy, which applied to
    employees in the retail branch network from February 1, 1993 to April 10, 2006,
    covered all class members (the “1993 Overtime Policy”). It provided for
    additional compensation where employees worked more than 8 hours a day or 37.5
    hours a week, but required that employees get management approval before
    working overtime in order to receive payment (pre-approval). There was no
    provision for getting management approval after the overtime hours were worked
    (post-approval). The second policy, which applied to all of the Bank’s lines of
    business, was put in place starting on April 10, 2006 (the “2006 Overtime
    Policy”). This policy maintained the pre-approval requirement, but also allowed
    for post-approval in extenuating circumstances where approval was sought as
    soon as possible after the overtime work was done. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This class action concerns the application of

lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To address these common issues, the motion judge
    had to interpret and apply s. 174 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Canada

  <p class=LegislativeQuote><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Overtime pay or time off </span></strong></p>

    clear that the standard hours of work cannot exceed eight hours per day and
    forty hours per week. An employee who is “required or permitted” to work more
    than the standard hours of work must be paid time and a half. Additionally, under
    s. 24(2) of the&nbsp;</span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Canada Labour Standards

lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Against this legislative backdrop, what does the
    expression “required or permitted” in s. 174 of the Code mean? In his liability
    reasons, the motion judge focused on the interpretation of the word “permitted”
    and noted that “[t]he policy question is whether ‘permitted’ should be
    interpreted narrowly favouring the employer (and meaning ‘impliedly required’)
    or more broadly favouring the employee (and meaning ‘allowed’ or ‘not

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The harm which the Act seeks to remedy is that
    individual employees, and, in particular non-unionized employees, are often in
    an unequal bargaining position in relation to their employers.… Accordingly, an
    interpretation of the Act which encourages employers to comply with the minimum
    requirements of the Act, and so extends its protections to as many employees as
    possible, is to be favoured over one that does not.<a href="#_ftn8"

    cases interpreting s.&nbsp;174 of the Code have, with only one exception,
    viewed the section as a worker protection provision in which “permitted” means
    “allow” or “fail to prevent”. He listed the main takeaways from the case law
    interpreting “permitted” in the context of overtime work as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>&#9642; The Code imposes liability for
    overtime “whenever it is permitted, even if it is not required or authorized.
    The intent of the Code is to protect employees who are simply allowed to work
    overtime without pay.” </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>&#9642; An employer cannot “simply look the
    other way when an employee is working beyond the standard hours” then claim the
    work was not required or permitted. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>&#9642; An employer cannot “avoid these
    statutory obligations by knowingly permitting employees to work overtime and
    then later taking the position the overtime was not authorized. This is in fact
    the mischief sought to be avoided by the use of the word ‘permitted’ in Section
    174.” </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>&#9642; In other words, an employer is liable
    for permitting overtime if it “acquiesce[s] by its failure to prevent.”<a

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the Bank highlights that the Code gives
    the employer the right to determine when overtime hours will be worked. The Bank
    argues that, respectful of the Code’s direction that an employer must pay
    overtime that it requires or permits, its overtime policies were developed for
    the purpose of discouraging overtime work. They were never intended to permit
    overtime work that was not compensated.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Bank argues that in finding the policies to
    be inconsistent with the Code, the motion judge ignored evidence in the
    policies themselves, which formed part of the employment contracts, that the
    Bank intended to comply with the Code. The Bank points to the 1993 Overtime
    Policy, which expressly stated that overtime work in excess of 8 hours in a day
    or 37.5 hours over a week would be paid. It also reminded employees to obtain
    the “approval of their supervisor or manager” before working overtime and
    instructs: “It is against the law to not pay overtime.” The text of the 2006
    Overtime Policy, under the “Intent” heading, reads: “CIBC has developed this
    Employee Overtime Policy (Canada) to help management align our resources
    appropriately and in accordance with the legal and regulatory framework
    governing overtime.” The Bank argues that the clear intent of the policies was
    to comply with the Code. Accordingly, the Bank submits that the motion judge
    erred by interpreting the policies contrary to “the objective intention” of the
    Bank and a “common sense” reading of the policies’ text.<a href="#_ftn11"

    motivation behind a policy is not relevant to whether it breaches the Code. Because
    the Bank’s policies caused uncompensated overtime on a systemic basis, the Bank
    breached s. 174 of the Code.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the Bank submits that although authorization

lang=EN-CA> overtime hours, it was not a pre-condition for </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>compensation</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. The 1993 Overtime Policy
    set out that employees would be compensated for overtime that a manager pre-approved.
    The 2006 Overtime Policy provided for both pre- and post-approval, each of
    which would result in compensation. The 2006 Overtime Policy read, in part:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In order for employees to be compensated for
    overtime hours worked, the hours must be pre-approved by a manager in advance.
    Overtime, for which prior management approval was not obtained, will not be
    compensated unless there are extenuating circumstances and approval is obtained
    as soon as possible afterwards.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Bank argues that pre-approval allowed it to
    control its employees’ hours of work and allocate resources in a cost-effective
    manner while compensating employees for overtime hours worked, as it was
    permitted to do, according to the authorities. The Bank relies on the principle
    that an employer must have knowledge of the overtime worked and that the
    employer must expressly or impliedly indicate that the work could be
    undertaken. In other words, “[e]mployees cannot unilaterally elect to perform
    work outside of their scheduled hours of work and claim compensation for such

    are being worked. The Bank submits that imposing this positive duty is contrary
    to the Act and the approach taken in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Lafarge</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, to the effect that overtime hours cannot be considered “required
    or permitted” where the employer has no knowledge of the work. </span></p>

    language in s.&nbsp;174 of the Code. With respect to the 2006 Overtime Policy,
    he found that the addition of possible post-approval in extenuating

    exception. </span><span lang=EN>However, the motion judge concluded that </span><span

    actively prevent employees from working overtime hours. This duty does not
    conflict with the employer’s right to manage its workforce. This duty does not
    subject an employer to indeterminate liability because the employer will not be
    found to have permitted overtime work unless the employer has actual or
    constructive knowledge that its employees are working beyond the hours
    permitted under the Code. The risk of silence in the face of actual or
    constructive knowledge falls on the employer. The motion judge did not impose a
    duty on employers to compensate employees for overtime hours of which it was

    common issue, as: “One, has the plaintiff established that at least some of the
    class members worked uncompensated overtime? And two, has the plaintiff
    established that it is more likely than not that these hours of uncompensated

    including an open forum survey, a workplace effectiveness project, and theme
    reports. This evidence, produced by the Bank, included specific references to
    Bank employees working overtime hours that were not compensated. For example, the
    motion judge points to “hundreds of comments” relating to overtime in employee
    survey evidence produced by the Bank.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span

    consistent with other cases analyzing systemic breaches. For example, in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Insurance Corp. of British Columbia</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>,
    the arbitrator found irrelevant the employer’s argument that unpaid overtime
    was not a “pervasive” issue. The arbitrator wrote that the claim “is not an

    beyond their regular hours because the issue was whether the employer “failed
    to put mechanisms in place to… prevent employees working beyond their regularly
    scheduled shifts.”<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span

    expressly repeats the pre-approval requirement. To reiterate, system-wide policies
    told class members that overtime work would not be compensated unless it was
    pre-approved (or post-approved in extenuating circumstances after 2006). Hours

    record-keeping. To support a finding of a breach of this common issue, the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge found that the “appropriate

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[76]</span></span></span></a> He gave two main reasons for concluding that the “appropriate means” test was
    not met. First, “some (and perhaps many) of the class members feared reprisal
    and were afraid that they might lose their job if they sued the bank for unpaid
    overtime”.<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title=""><span

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[77]</span></span></span></a> Second, “some (and perhaps many) of the class members reasonably relied on the
    bank’s repeated misrepresentations throughout the 16-year class period that the
    bank’s overtime policies complied with federal labour law.”<a href="#_ftn78"

    combined to require individual assessments of when discoverability was met for
    an individual claimant, consistent with the general rule that “the viability of
    a limitations defence is best determined on an individual basis with individual
    assessments – hence its usual relegation to the individual hearings phase.”<a

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The defendant bank has not established on the
    evidence that the limitation period that applies to <em>every</em> class member’s
    claim (outside the limitation periods noted in its Schedule) can be determined
    in common on a class-wide basis and that individual discoverability is not
    needed. In my view, the evidence strongly suggests that individual discovery
    will be needed in at least some cases to fairly determine whether the class
    member delayed in taking legal action because they were in reasonable fear of
    losing their job; because they reasonably relied on the bank’s
    misrepresentations about the legality of its overtime policy; or because they
    were otherwise impeded by the bank’s systemic policies and practices.<a

  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Common law discoverability</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Bank’s second argument is that the question of whether a class
    member knew that a proceeding was an “appropriate means” to remedy unpaid
    overtime is only relevant to class members’ claims governed by statutes that
    include such discoverability language, that is, claims in Ontario, Saskatchewan,
    and Alberta. On that basis, a class-wide limitations order would be appropriate
    for all other claims. The Bank adds that this argument might also extend to
    claims in Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta that predate the amendments adding
    discoverability language into the statutory text.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Bank argues that the “appropriate means” criterion in s.
    5(1)(a)(iv) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Limitations Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> is not an element of the common law discoverability rules, relying
    on </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>407 ETR Concession Company Limited v. Day</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> and other cases.<a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[85]</span></span></span></a> We do not agree that common law discoverability rules could not be found to
    function in an equivalent manner. The ordinary development of the common law
    means that the categories are not closed. Whether this argument has traction is
    a matter to be decided on the individual assessments and not on a fact-free,
    class-wide basis.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Bank also argues that the motion judge effectively reversed the
    burden of proof applicable to discoverability. Once it had proven that the
    claimants were aware of their claims, the Bank argues that “the burden was on
    the plaintiff to establish that there was a basis to delay the running of the
    limitations period.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>We would not give effect to this argument. Having moved for summary
    judgment, the onus was on the Bank to establish that it was so entitled. In any
    event, as we explain above, the respondent has established a sufficient basis
    to require the application of the limitations defence to be worked out on an
    individual basis. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge did not err in refusing to
    address the purported extra-provincial reach of s. 28 of the </span><em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This class proceeding has a national reach, with class members
    across the provinces. The Bank argues that because limitation periods affect
    the substantive rights of plaintiffs and defendants, they fall squarely within
    provincial power over “property and civil rights” under s. 92(13) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Constitution Act, 1867</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. Accordingly, because
    Ontario may not legislate extra-territorially with respect to substantive
    rights, s. 28(1) of the Act – which suspends the running of limitation periods
    in favour of class members – should not serve to suspend the limitation periods
    applicable under local legislation to claims of class members who reside
    outside of Ontario. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

    He stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The defendant bank has asked that I rule on
    the s. 28(1) extra-provincial question even if I dismiss its request for a

    never reach an individual hearings stage. The constitutional question is

    Bank takes issue with the motion judge’s treatment of this evidence. The Bank
    points out that at paras. 57 and 58 of the liability reasons, the motion judge
    appears to cite passages from two different compliance monitoring documents. In
    fact, both quoted passages are from the same document. The inference the Bank
    invites us to draw, based on the presentation of this evidence in the
    respondent’s written submissions, is that the motion judge merely relied upon the
    respondent’s factum instead of engaging with the record, because he referred in
    para. 58 to “<u>a</u> Compliance Monitoring Report” rather than “<u>the
    Compliance Monitoring Report”, to which he had referred in para. 57. </u></span><span
lang=EN-CA> </span><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>We
    decline to draw this inference. The document clearly states that “time worked
    is not recorded except for the purpose of payment of overtime for salaried
    employees or other purpose”. The motion judge made appropriate use of this
    evidence in concluding that actual hours worked were not being systematically
    tracked for non-salaried employees.</span><span lang=EN-CA> </span></p>
