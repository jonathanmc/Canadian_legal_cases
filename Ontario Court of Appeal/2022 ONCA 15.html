  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This Crown appeal raises the question of how a
    jury should be instructed on the <em>mens rea</em> requirement for sexual
    assault when the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent
    is not available to the accused. That question is part of a broader one concerning
    the extent to which the knowledge element of the offence — that the accused
    knew of, or was wilfully blind to or reckless as to, the absence of the
    complainant’s consent to the sexual activity — is to be considered when the
    accused has no defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was not in dispute at trial that the
    complainant and respondent had engaged in sexual activity. The complainant
    testified that she did not consent; the respondent’s position was that the
    complainant did consent and that her evidence that she did not consent was not
    credible. He gave evidence that included why he believed, from their
    interaction, that she was consenting.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Prior to instructing the jury, the trial judge
    conducted a pre-charge conference. At it, the parties agreed, and the trial
    judge accepted, that if the jury was satisfied that the complainant had not
    consented to the sexual activity, there was no air of reality to a defence of
    honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent. Accordingly, the defence
    would not be left with the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge indicated that he proposed to
    instruct the jury that to convict, they had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt on four elements: (a) that there had been intentional touching, (b) of a
    sexual nature, (c) without the complainant’s consent, and (d) that the
    respondent knew of, or was wilfully blind or reckless as to, the absence of the
    complainant’s consent (the “knowledge element”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown objected to the fourth element – the knowledge
    element – being left with the jury, on the basis that if the jury was satisfied
    on the first three elements, there was nothing further for the jury to
    consider. As the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent
    was not available to the respondent, he could not have had a non-culpable
    mental state and the knowledge element should have been treated as satisfied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected the Crown’s position.
    He instructed the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    on each of the four elements. He provided summaries of evidence relevant to the
    first three elements, including the respondent’s evidence of his perception of
    the complainant’s conduct and why he viewed that as her consent. On the knowledge
    element, he told the jury to consider all of the evidence, including the
    evidence he had summarized on the other elements.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, the Crown argues that it was an error
    to leave the knowledge element with the jury at all, or, alternatively, in the
    manner that it was left.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the Crown submits that the knowledge element
    of the offence is co-extensive with the defence of honest but mistaken belief
    in communicated consent, and that if the defence is not available to the
    accused, there is no room for reasonable doubt about the accused’s knowledge of
    the complainant’s non-consent. The Crown argues that when there is no air of
    reality to a defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent,
    “the jury should be instructed that guilt is established if they are satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intentionally touched the
    complainant in circumstances of a sexual nature, without her consent.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, and in the alternative, the Crown argues
    that even if the knowledge element may be left with the jury when the defence
    of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent is unavailable to the
    accused, that unavailability will in most cases be practically conclusive on
    the knowledge element, and that it was in this case. The jury should have been
    told this. Inviting the jury to consider all of the evidence to determine
    whether there was knowledge of non-consent without further guidance as to what
    they could and could not consider on this issue risked the jury considering
    irrelevant matters and engaging in impermissible forms of reasoning.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent submits that the knowledge
    element of the <em>mens rea</em> requirement for sexual assault is part of the
    Crown’s burden as a matter of law, and that this burden is not contingent on
    the presence of the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated
    consent. He argues that the trial judge was bound to charge on the need for the
    Crown to prove the knowledge element as part of the <em>mens rea</em>. He also
    argues that if there was an error, it could not have affected the verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the respondent that it was not an
    error of law to instruct the jury that the charge of sexual assault required
    that the Crown prove that the respondent knew of, or was wilfully blind or
    reckless as to, the complainant’s non-consent, even where the defence of honest
    but mistaken belief in communicated consent was unavailable to the respondent. In
    my view, the argument that the unavailability of the defence equates with proof
    by the Crown of the knowledge element must be rejected in light of <em>R. v.
    Morrison</em>, 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3 and <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Carbone</em>,
    2020 ONCA 394, 150 O.R. (3d) 758. There are important reasons of principle to legally
    distinguish the unavailability of a defence from proof of the Crown’s case even
    in situations where there is little practical difference between them. The
    Supreme Court has, since <em>Morrison</em>, repeated that proving the knowledge
    element is part of the Crown’s burden in a charge of sexual assault.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>But I agree with the Crown that in the
    circumstances, the trial judge’s instruction to the jury had to provide

    guests at a wedding and at the reception that followed it. They had not met
    before the wedding. The respondent testified that he had approximately nine or

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified that she had no
    interaction with the respondent at the wedding or reception until, toward the
    end of the evening, she was waiting in a hallway to use one of the individual
    bathrooms. The respondent, who was in one of those bathrooms, opened the door
    and pulled her in, which surprised and confused her. She introduced herself,
    but he did not respond or answer her when she asked who he was. <a
name="_Hlk89090940">He proceeded to penetrate her orally, vaginally, and anally
    with his penis. She described herself as being in a state of shock, confusion,
    and disassociation, unable to process what was happening or understand how such
    a violent act could take place at a family wedding. </a>She asked him a series
    of questions concerning who he was, what was going on, and how she got there.
    He did not answer. She also asked whether they were related, whether he was
    married, and whether he was related to the bride. He said that he was not
    married, they were not related, and that he was related to the bride. When he
    was finished anally penetrating her, he left the bathroom without saying
    anything further to her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent testified that he met the complainant
    briefly at the wedding ceremony, but they did not engage in conversation.
    Around midnight, he had a 15-minute conversation with her near the washrooms
    that was neither romantic nor sexual. When he went to use one of the bathrooms,
    the complainant followed him, cut in front of him, and backed into the
    bathroom, looking at him and smiling. They began to kiss; she dropped to her
    knees and he undid his pants. She performed oral sex on him. When he lost
    interest in oral sex and stepped back, she stood up, turned around, and looked
    back at him smiling. He pulled up her dress, pulled down her underwear, and
    penetrated her vagina with his penis. After vaginal intercourse, he stopped and
    left the bathroom without saying anything to the complainant.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent explained that he took the
    complainant’s initial eye contact and smile as an invitation to join her in the
    bathroom, and believed, after they had oral sex and she stood up, turned around,
    and looked at him smiling, that this was an invitation to have sexual
    intercourse. The respondent assumed that the complainant consented to the
    sexual activity based on her eye contact and smiles. He agreed that at no point
    did the complainant verbally communicate consent. The only conversation that
    occurred inside the bathroom, according to the respondent, was that she twice
    asked if they were related, to which he replied “no.”</span></p>

    Crown agreed that there was no air of reality to a defence of honest but
    mistaken belief in communicated consent. They disagreed as to whether the
    “fourth element of sexual assault” – whether the accused knew that the
    complainant did not consent – should be put to the jury. The Crown’s position
    was that the jury should not be directed that the Crown had to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the respondent knew the complainant was not consenting.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    including <em>R. v. Barton</em>, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579. He
    instructed the jury as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>For you to find [the respondent] guilty of

    beyond a reasonable doubt:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That [the respondent] intentionally touched [the

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>b.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That the touching took place in circumstances of

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the first two elements (elements (a) and (b)
    above) – whether intentional sexual touching took place – the trial judge
    reminded the jury that both the complainant and the respondent testified that
    there was contact of a sexual nature between them. He told the jury that
    although there were differences in their testimony as to what sexual touching
    occurred (for example, the complainant described anal sex and the respondent
    denied it), each type of sexual touching they described was capable of
    supporting these two elements of the charge. He told the jury that it was for
    them to decide which of the incidents of sexual touching had occurred, as all
    of the essential elements of the offence had to be considered for each incident
    they found to have in fact occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then summarized the evidence
    relating to each alleged incident of sexual touching. While doing so, the trial
    judge made reference to the respondent’s evidence that the complainant got down
    on her knees “in a gesture that he understood to be an invitation to undo his
    pants”, that he “interpreted” her standing, turning, and smiling at him as an
    invitation to have sex with her, and that he had “no doubt” that she wanted him
    to engage in sex with her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the third element (element (c) above – whether
    the complainant consented to the sexual activity with the respondent), the
    trial judge set out the definition of consent as the voluntary agreement of the
    complainant to engage in the particular sexual activity. He instructed the jury
    that a complainant is not obliged to express lack of consent by words or conduct,
    and that silence or lack of resistance did not constitute consent. He cautioned
    the jury about falling prey to common stereotypes and myths concerning sexual
    assault and sexual assault victims.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge told the jury that when dealing
    with this third element, they were to be concerned solely with the
    complainant’s subjective state of mind – whether she in fact consented to the
    sexual activity in question. He added that the respondent’s “knowledge and
    appreciation of that question will be considered under the next essential
    element [i.e. the knowledge element] below.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He then provided a review of the evidence of the
    respondent and the complainant as to what had occurred, adding the observation
    that credibility was central to the issue of whether the complainant consented.
    While providing that review, he referred to the respondent’s evidence that “she
    subsequently stood up, placed her hands upon the counter and turned around to
    look at him and smile. He inferred from these gestures and the fact that she
    had initiated oral sex a moment earlier that she was inviting him to have
    vaginal sex with her and consenting to his doing so.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the knowledge element (element
    (d) above – whether the respondent knew that the complainant did not consent), the
    trial judge instructed the jury that if they were considering that element, it
    was because they were satisfied that the prior elements of the charge had been
    established beyond a reasonable doubt. He told the jury:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>This last element requires you to consider [the
    respondent’s] state of mind in relation to the sexual activity in question.
    Crown counsel must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [the respondent] was
    aware that [the complainant] did not consent to the sexual activity in question
    when he touched her.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>To prove that [the respondent] was aware of [the
    complainant’s] lack of consent, the Crown must prove one of the following:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That [the respondent] knew that [the complainant]

    that [the complainant] did not consent to the sexual activity in question and [the
    respondent] proceeded in the face of that risk; or </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That [the respondent] was aware of indications
    that [the complainant] did not consent to the sexual activity in question, but
    deliberately chose to ignore them because he did not want to know the truth.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge did not provide a separate
    summary of the evidence regarding the knowledge element. He told the jury that
    they must review all of the evidence, including the evidence he had previously
    summarized, “to answer the question of [the respondent’s] state of mind at the
    time that he engaged in the sexual activity with [the complainant].” He invited
    the jury to “consider all of the evidence concerning the words exchanged
    between the [complainant and respondent] and their actions immediately prior
    to, during and immediately after the incident of sexual touching.” He told the
    jury that the same evidence that he had previously summarized “is relevant to
    your review of this last essential element.” He concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If you have a reasonable doubt about whether [the
    respondent] knew that [the complainant] did not consent to the sexual activity
    in question, then you must find [the respondent] not guilty of the crime of
    sexual assault as charged in the indictment.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If you are satisfied that the Crown has proved

lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After some deliberation, the jury returned with
    a question: “Can a person be so intoxicated that they cannot know of a risk of
    non-consent or [i]f we believe that a person is drunk enough to not consider
    the risk of non-consent would we then be required to not convict or acquit the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the first issue – whether there was an error
    in the jury charge – a distinction should be noted between the Crown’s two
    submissions. The Crown’s first submission is that, in a case where the defence
    of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent is unavailable, the jury
    should not be told that the Crown has the burden of proving the knowledge
    element. Rather, “the jury should be instructed that guilt is established if
    they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intentionally
    touched the complainant in circumstances of a sexual nature, without her
    consent.” If the first submission fails, the second submission is about what else
    the jury must be told after it is told the Crown has the burden of proving the
    knowledge element.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In other words, the first submission locates the
    error in the portion of the charge that describes the Crown as having the
    burden of proving the knowledge element in a case where there is no air of
    reality to a defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent. It
    posits that it is legally wrong to describe the Crown as having that burden in
    such a case. The second submission locates the error in the portion of the
    charge that follows; that is, in the portion that tells the jury how they
    should approach and what they should consider when determining whether the knowledge
    element is satisfied.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Supreme Court of Canada has consistently formulated
    the <em>mens rea</em> of the offence as including the knowledge element – the requirement
    that the accused knew of, was wilfully blind to or was reckless about, the
    absence of the complainant’s consent to the sexual activity. The accused must
    have intentionally touched the complainant “knowing of, or being reckless of or

lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Because these are the legal components of the
    offence of sexual assault, on which the Crown bears the burden, a jury would
    ordinarily be told this to “understand the issues involved [and] the law
    relating to the charge the accused is facing”: <em>Cooper</em>, at p. 163. These
    components, including the requirement that the Crown prove the knowledge
    element, are accordingly reflected in the two model jury instructions commonly
    used in Canada: <em>Watt’s Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions</em><em><span

    Both model instructions start from the implicit premise that the knowledge
    element is part of the Crown’s burden in all cases. The Watt model varies the
    instruction on the knowledge element component when the defence of honest but
    mistaken belief in communicated consent has an air of reality to it; the CJC
    model instruction adds an additional instruction on the defence of honest but
    mistaken belief in communicated consent when there is an air of reality to the
    defence. Neither contemplates deleting the knowledge element component as part
    of the instruction if there was no air of reality to the defence.</span></p>

    Crown’s burden to prove the knowledge element in a charge of sexual assault is inapplicable
    if the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent is not

    in issue whenever the defence is not available, and it is an error for the jury

    means “the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual

    “every sexual act in a particular encounter”: <em>J.A.</em>, at para. 31. Section
    273.1(2) of the <em>Code</em> contains a non-exhaustive list of circumstances
    in which consent is not obtained, while s. 273.1(3) “authorizes the courts to

    complainant did not actually, subjectively, consent within the meaning of the <em>Code</em> to that sexual touching. The focus then shifts to the accused’s mental state,

    Stewart noted in “Fault and ‘Reasonable Steps’: The Troubling Implications of <em>Morrison</em> and <em>Barton</em>” (2019) 24&nbsp;Can. Crim. L. Rev. 379, at p. 381:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The case law and commentary before <i>Morrison</i> strongly suggest that a “reasonable steps” requirement, as it applies to an
    offence that otherwise requires proof of knowledge of an inculpatory fact,
    creates an alternative route by which the Crown can prove the fault element of
    the offence. Instead of proving that the accused knew the inculpatory fact, the
    Crown could prove fault by proving that the accused failed to take reasonable
    steps, in the circumstances known to him at the time, to ascertain the
    exculpatory fact.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The view found support, for example, in a
    passage in <em>R. v. George</em>, 2017&nbsp;SCC 38, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021. In
    that case, speaking of the offence of sexual interference contrary to s. 151 of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which is subject to a statutory “mistaken belief in
    age” provision in s. 150.1(4), Gascon J. said, at para. 8:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]o convict an accused person who
    demonstrates an “air of reality” to the mistake of age defence, the Crown must
    prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, either that the accused person (1) did not
    honestly believe the complainant was at least 16 (the subjective element); or (2)
    did not take “all reasonable steps” to ascertain the complainant’s age (the
    objective element). [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the Crown argues that the view is
    supported by sexual assault cases where there was no air of reality to a defence
    of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent, and convictions were
    upheld even though the jury was instructed to consider only whether the accused
    had engaged in intentional touching of a sexual nature without the
    complainant’s consent: see, e.g., <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Robertson</em>, [1987] 1
    S.C.R. 918.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the latter point, I note that it does not
    necessarily follow that because a jury could be properly instructed in a
    particular case without reference to the knowledge element, it is always an
    error to instruct the jury by making reference to the knowledge element. Jury
    charges are reviewed functionally. There can be more than one adequate way to
    instruct a jury. And the reasons in <em>Robertson</em> make it clear that the
    issue the court decided was whether the defence of honest but mistaken belief
    in communicated consent was to be left with the jury, as Wilson J. defined the
    issue to be: “Should the trial judge, in every sexual assault case, instruct
    the jury to consider whether the accused had an honest, though mistaken, belief
    in consent?”: <em>Robertson</em>, at p. 929. She concluded that the trial judge
    did not err in instructing the jury without reference to the defence of honest
    but mistaken belief in consent as there was no air of reality to the defence: <em>Robertson</em>,
    at p. 940.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, I need not resolve whether, prior to <em>Morrison</em>,
    a finding that the knowledge element was satisfied followed automatically, as a
    matter of law, from the failure of the accused to take reasonable steps to
    determine whether a complainant was communicating consent, or from the presence
    of another legal impediment to the defence. I am persuaded that in light of <em>Morrison</em><i> </i>and developments since, it is not the law now.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I reach this conclusion for three closely
    related reasons. First, <em>Morrison</em> affirmed as a bedrock principle of
    criminal law, grounded in the presumption of innocence, that the negation of a
    defence and the establishment of the Crown’s case have a well-accepted
    theoretical and legal difference. This difference is to be respected even in
    cases where there is little practical difference between the negation of a
    defence and the affirmative establishment of the Crown’s burden. <em>Morrison</em> expressly counselled against reading the passage from <em>George</em> referred
    to above in a way that would sweep away that bedrock principle. Second, the
    knowledge element is part of the <em>mens rea</em> requirement formulated by
    the Supreme Court, including in cases that post-date <em>Morrison</em>. It is
    thus an essential legal element of the offence and one on which the Crown bears
    the burden. That legal formulation is not expressed in terms that support the
    conclusion that the knowledge element is an essential element of the offence only
    if the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent is in
    play. Third, the symmetry between the knowledge element and the defence that
    the Crown asserts, although extensive, is not complete, since, as the Crown
    concedes, it is possible to envisage situations when knowledge of non-consent
    is an issue that do not involve belief in consent.</span></p>

    displacement of a defence (or its unavailability) makes conviction a “virtual
    certainty” and if, for practical purposes in most cases, there is little
    distance between negativing a defence (or its unavailability) and proving the
    requisite <em>mens&nbsp;rea</em>: <em>Morrison</em>, at para. 88; <em>Carbone</em>,
    at para. 121. This proposition is fundamentally irreconcilable with the Crown’s

    accused to satisfy the reasonable steps requirement does not provide a second
    pathway to conviction; it merely limits a defence: at paras. 80, 82, 84 and 126.
    In other words, while the reasonable steps requirement imposes an evidentiary
    burden on the accused, the Crown still bears the ultimate persuasive burden: <em>Morrison</em><i>,</i> at paras. 84, 116 and 121. As a matter of law, an accused cannot be convicted
    simply for failing to establish a defence. The Crown must negate any defence
    that is raised and also show that all of the essential elements of the offence
    were proved: <em>Morrison</em>, at para. 90. Whether the accused is convicted
    or acquitted depends not on whether the accused has made out their defence, but
    on whether the Crown has proved all of the essential elements of the offence,
    including the applicable <em>mens rea</em>: <em>Morrison,</em> at paras. 116,
    126. If the Crown proves that reasonable steps were not taken, the trier of
    fact cannot consider the defence that the accused believed the person was of
    legal age. But that does not relieve the Crown from its burden to prove, beyond
    a reasonable doubt, that the accused believed the person was not of age: <em>Morrison</em>,

    set out the following steps that a trier of fact should follow when considering
    the offence of invitation to sexual touching, contrary to s. 152 of the <em>Code</em>.
    First, the trier must determine whether there is an air of reality to the
    defence established in s. 150.1(4) (belief that the complainant was 16 or
    older, a defence which is only available if the accused took all reasonable
    steps to ascertain age). If there is no air of reality to the defence, any
    claim that the accused believed the complainant was at least 16 must be
    “removed from the evidentiary mix.” The trier of fact must then still proceed
    to consider whether the Crown has proved that the accused had the <em>mens rea</em><i> </i>relevant to the offence. The Crown cannot prove the requisite <i>mens rea </i>by
    disproving a mistake of age defence, but must prove the accused had the

    overlap between the <em>mens rea</em> requirement and the defence is apparent. Both
    address the accused’s perception of consent, as it is legally defined for the
    purposes of sexual assault, against the backdrop of no such consent actually
    having been given by the complainant. For that reason, “[t]he accused’s
    perception of consent is examined as part of the <em>mens rea</em>, including
    the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent”: <em>G.F.</em>,
    at para. 25; <em>Barton</em>, at para. 90. Other indicators of this overlap
    include that the defence is properly understood as a denial of <em>mens&nbsp;rea</em>: <em>Ewanchuk</em><i>,</i> at para. 44, and that the <em>mens rea</em> requirement is met if the accused was wilfully blind or reckless regarding the
    absence of consent, just as the defence is unavailable if the accused’s belief

    requirement to prove an element of an offence as being legally contingent upon
    a particular defence being raised is quite another. This is especially so since <em>Morrison</em> and <em>Carbone</em> concluded that the distinction between
    the negativing of a defence and the Crown’s burden to prove elements of the offence
    must be respected even where the displacement of a defence (or its
    unavailability) makes conviction a “virtual certainty” and if, for practical

    consistent formulation of the <em>mens rea</em> requirement, including in decisions
    after <i>Morrison</i>, describes the burden on the Crown to show knowledge,

    on to observe that sexual assault is only culpable if the complainant does not
    consent to the touching, making the defence of honest but mistaken belief in
    communicated consent relevant. He continued: “As such, the <em>mens rea</em><i> </i>of sexual assault contains two elements: intention to touch and knowing of,

    territory. In <em>Barton</em>, for example, Moldaver J. stated that the <em>mens

    the trial judge concluded there was no air of reality to a defence of honest

    equivalent of a jury) that the Crown was required to prove the knowledge
    element, but went on to tell them that they should have “no difficulty concluding”
    that the knowledge element was satisfied if they believed the complainant had

    absent an air of reality in relation to the accused's honest but mistaken
    belief, the Crown does not have to prove knowledge of absence of consent — must
    be rejected. Because knowledge of absence of consent is an essential element of

    states of mind an accused person could have relating to the age of a minor sexual
    offence complainant, where the accused does not affirmatively believe the
    complainant was over 16. The first category includes those who believed the
    complainant was under 16, or who were wilfully blind to that fact. All of the
    offenders in the first category would be guilty because for each of them, the
    requisite knowledge element would be satisfied. The second category includes
    those who “may have appreciated the risk that the complainant was under 16 and
    decided to proceed with the activity”. All of the offenders in the second
    category would be guilty since this state of mind describes the classic, culpable <em>mens rea</em> of recklessness. The third category includes those who “may never
    have adverted to the complainant’s age and chose to proceed with the activity.”
    Offenders in this category who have not adverted to the age of the particular
    complainant because they have made a subjective decision to treat age as
    irrelevant and take the risk could be said to have the subjective state of mind
    of reckless indifference, a form of recklessness, and would therefore be guilty: <em>Carbone</em>, at paras. 122-27.</span></p>

    not be the case. He continued: “While one can imagine circumstances in which
    the failure to advert to the age of the complainant should not be characterized

    symmetry, the respondent raised a number of hypothetical cases in which, he
    argued, the issue in a sexual assault case would be about whether the knowledge
    element was present even though honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent
    would not apply. In <em>MacIntyre</em>, Bennett J.A. postulated a hypothetical
    to this effect, noting that although an honest but mistaken belief was one way
    to disprove <em>mens rea</em> in a sexual assault case, it was not the only way.
    She described a situation in which an accused, through no fault of their own
    (such as involuntary intoxication) had no belief about the complainant’s
    consent: at para. 65.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The point of the hypotheticals was to show that
    there could be cases where the knowledge element was not dependant on whether
    the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent. If that
    is so, it could not be legally accurate to say that the knowledge element of
    the offence was dependant on the defence being in play. Indeed, accepting the

    any of the hypotheticals offered, as the Crown fairly conceded in oral argument
    that it was “theoretically possible” that a scenario could arise in a sexual
    assault case where the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated
    consent was unavailable, but the subjective <em>mens rea</em> requirement, including
    the knowledge element, was still a live issue. Crown counsel accepted that in such

    of evidence that can and cannot constitute such steps: <em>Barton</em>, at

    the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent must be
    equally clear, but in such a case, the clarity required is that evidence of the
    accused’s mistaken belief in consent is not to be considered at all when the
    jury determines whether the accused had the necessary <em><span lang=EN-CA>mens
    rea</span></em>. The provisions of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Code</span></em> that limit the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent do
    not cease to apply to an assertion of a mistaken belief in consent that does
    not meet the requirements of the defence. The <em><span lang=EN-CA>Code</span></em> is clear. Any belief that does not meet the requirements of s. 273.2 of the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Code</span></em> is not a defence <span lang=EN-CA>– </span>it is
    not exculpatory.</p>

lang=EN-CA> </span></i>in the case of invitation to sexual touching, “[i]f the
    accused fails to take reasonable steps to determine the complainant’s age, he
    cannot advance the claim that he believed the complainant was the required
    age”: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Carbone</span></em>, at para. 130; see also, <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Morrison</span></em>, at paras. 83, 121 and 124. Any evidence of
    belief must be “removed from the evidentiary mix” in considering whether the
    Crown has met its burden: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Carbone</span></em>, at para.
    129. Similarly, evidence of an accused’s mistaken belief in the complainant’s
    consent to sexual touching must also be removed from the evidentiary mix, if it
    is not within the range of beliefs in consent that “an accused may lawfully
    hold”: <em><span lang=EN-CA>G.F.</span></em>, at para. 1.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If it were otherwise, an accused could sidestep the stringent

    consent by relying on this same belief, without reference to the restrictions
    imposed on it, at the <em><span lang=EN-CA>mens&nbsp;rea</span></em><i><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Care must thus be taken, in a case where the
    defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent is unavailable,
    not to, for example, point the jury to evidence of belief in consent in their
    consideration of <em>mens rea</em> and thus allow the defence to re-enter
    through the back door: <em>MacIntyre</em>, at para. 67.</span></p>

    Crown’s burden to prove elements of the offence and the non-availability of the
    defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent, in some cases
    the circumstances that lead to the conclusion that there is no air of reality
    to the defence are, practically speaking, the same as those that prove the
    knowledge element. In other words, in those cases, there is little practical
    difference between what displaces the defence and what satisfies the knowledge
    element of the <em>mens rea</em> requirement: <em>Carbone</em>, at para. 121.
    The jury must be instructed in such a way that it is not misled into seeing
    more of a distinction than properly exists.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>One way of doing so is by means of a “little
    difficulty” instruction, as discussed in the Alberta Court of Appeal decision
    in <i>Barton</i> (<em>R. v. Barton</em>, 2017 ABCA 216, 354 C.C.C. (3d) 245,
    rev’d on other grounds, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579). Although this aspect
    of the decision was not addressed on appeal to the Supreme Court, it is
    nevertheless instructive. At footnote 105, the Court of Appeal said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Where mistaken belief is not a live issue,
    this raises the question whether a trial judge should instruct the jury
    (providing it is satisfied that all the required <em>actus reus</em> elements
    were met and the judge has properly outlined these) that: ‘If you are satisfied
    that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant did
    not consent to that sexual activity, you should have little difficulty in
    concluding that the accused knew or was wilfully blind to the fact that the
    complainant was not consenting to the sexual activity in question or was
    reckless and chose to take the risk.’ Should more be required, then the jury
    instructions should identify what it is that the Crown must then prove to bring
    home to the accused culpability based on actual knowledge or its equivalent,
    wilful blindness or recklessness.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In consent-or-no-consent cases (including this
    case, as discussed below), if the trier of fact accepts the complainant's
    evidence that there is no consent, the knowledge element is easily proven. This
    supports the suggestion in footnote 105 of <em>Barton ABCA</em><i> </i>that <span
class=Underline>in the absence of a mistake of fact defence, juries may be told
    that if they accept the evidence of a complainant on the issue of consent, they
    will have little difficulty finding the element of knowledge proved</span>.

    communicated consent is unavailable, the trial judge should proceed as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The jury should be instructed that, as a matter of law, the accused
    cannot rely on a defence that the accused mistakenly believed the complainant
    consented to the sexual activity. Therefore, the jury is to proceed on the
    factual premise that the accused did not affirmatively believe that the
    complainant was consenting or communicating consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>b.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The jury should be instructed that they should not rely on evidence
    if it is only relevant in supporting an inference that the accused believed
    that the complainant was consenting or had communicated consent, and the trial
    judge should provide guidance in this regard by identifying for the jury the
    type of evidence it should not consider.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>If there is an air of reality to a defence that the accused did not
    know of the lack of the complainant’s consent on a basis other than a belief in
    consent (for example, the type of situation envisaged in the <em>MacIntyre</em> hypothetical), the jury should be directed to the evidence that they should
    consider on this issue.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the jury was instructed that they
    should consider all the evidence – the entire interaction – on the question of
    whether the knowledge element was proven, including evidence that the trial
    judge had previously summarized. They were told it was all relevant to the
    issue of whether the knowledge element was satisfied. This included references
    to the respondent’s evidence that he interpreted the complainant looking and
    smiling at him, and standing and turning around, as her invitation to him to
    engage in vaginal intercourse with her, causing him to have no doubt that this
    was what she wanted, and to infer that she was consenting.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This was evidence of the respondent’s belief in consent. It was also
    evidence of a mistaken belief, if the jury was addressing the elements in the
    order the trial judge had instructed. To be considering the knowledge element,
    they would have already concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the third
    element was satisfied; that is, that the complainant had not actually
    consented.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The jury was not told that the evidence of belief was not
    exculpatory or a defence, or that it must be removed from the evidentiary mix.
    Rather, the jury was pointed to it and told it could be considered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The effect of the trial judge’s charge was to leave evidence of mistaken
    belief in consent with the jury and invite them to consider it on the issue of the
    respondent’s “state of mind in relation to the sexual activity … [whether he]
    was aware that [the complainant] did not consent to the sexual activity in
    question when he touched her.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge did not instruct the jury that there were any limits
    on when a belief in consent can be lawfully held and when it can have
    exculpatory effect. Therefore, even viewing the charge as a whole, there is no
    basis to conclude the jury would have understood those limits from the
    instructions they were given.<a name="_Hlk88739635"> While the trial judge did
    instruct the jury on consent at the <em>actus reus</em> stage, by cautioning
    them about stereotypes and myths regarding sexual assault, this was not
    sufficient to make clear that beliefs of the respondent about consent, at the <em>mens
    rea</em> stage, could not properly be considered exculpatory. As noted above,
    the <em>Code</em> tightly restricts “the range of mistaken beliefs an accused
    may lawfully hold about the complainant’s consent” and “[n]ot all beliefs upon
    which an accused might rely will exculpate him”: <em>G.F.</em>, at para. 1; <em>Ewanchuk</em>,
    at para. 50; <em>Code</em>, s.&nbsp;273.2(a)-(c). The jury was not told in the
    initial charge that there were any restrictions on the exculpatory nature of
    mistaken beliefs, depending on what the belief was and how it arose. In effect,
    they were invited to consider evidence of a mistaken belief in consent which
    the parties agreed would not have exculpatory effect because there was no air
    of reality to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent
    that could be based on that evidence.</a></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The jury’s question, about the effect of intoxication, underscores
    the concern. The fact that the question was asked shows that the limits on when
    a belief in consent may be exculpatory had not been communicated. Although the
    intoxication question was answered, the more general concern of what the jury
    might have considered it could do with evidence of the respondent’s belief in
    consent remained unresolved.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Given that there was no air of reality to the defence of honest but
    mistaken belief in communicated consent, the trial judge had to give an
    instruction that did not risk the jury considering evidence of belief in
    consent. As the court pointed out in <em>MacIntyre</em>, it is an error to
    repackage the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent as
    an element of the offence by, for example, pointing the jury to evidence of the
    accused’s belief in consent on the question of whether the <em>mens rea</em> has been established. To do so introduces the defence improperly through the
    back door: <em>MacIntyre</em>, at para. 67. This error did not occur in <em>MacIntyre</em>,
    because the trial judge did not point the panel to evidence of belief in
    consent, but instead told them they should have no trouble finding the
    knowledge requirement satisfied (if they found there was actually no consent,
    the main issue in the case). But the error identified in <em>MacIntyre</em> is
    exactly what occurred here.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the trial judge did not provide the jury with guidance as
    to how to proceed with the evidence they could properly consider. He did not,
    for example, give an instruction that, based on the evidence they could
    consider, they should have “little difficulty” in finding the knowledge element
    satisfied. Nor did he identify what more the Crown had to prove to satisfy the
    knowledge element.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The instructions directed the jury to evidence of belief in consent,
    improperly introducing a defence that was not to be left with the jury. The
    jury instruction did not inoculate the jury against giving effect to legally
    ineffective beliefs. Nor did it guide the jury on what it could do with the
    evidence that it could properly consider. In my view, the charge was legally
    flawed.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>Where an error in a jury charge might reasonably, in the concrete
    reality of the case, have had a material bearing on an acquittal, such that the
    verdict would not necessarily have been the same as if the jury was properly
    instructed, a new trial should be directed: <em>R. v. Graveline</em>, 2006 SCC

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The error in the jury charge, in these circumstances, meets that
    test. The trial judge failed to limit the jury’s consideration of mistaken
    beliefs that would not actually negate the respondent’s <em>mens rea</em> or
    otherwise guide them on the evidence they could properly consider on the
    knowledge element. This error in the jury charge may reasonably have had a
    material bearing on the jury’s ultimate decision to acquit. The jury’s question
    suggests that they had reached the knowledge element in their deliberations,
    and the errors were central to a proper consideration of that issue.</span></p>
