  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is an error of law for a trial judge to discount the
    credibility of an accused’s evidence on the basis that it was tailored to fit
    Crown disclosure, or evidence or argument heard in court prior to the accused
    testifying. Drawing the inference that advance notice of the case against the
    accused has allowed the tailoring of evidence and thus made it suspect, though
    a natural temptation, is impermissible. It would create a constitutional trap,
    turning the right to be present at trial under s. 650(1) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46
    and the rights to full answer and defence under ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <em>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em><em>against
    the accused</em>: <em>R. v. White</em> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) (Ont. C.A.), at para. 20; <em>R.
    v. Schell</em> (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 219 (Ont. C.A.); <em>R.
    v. Thain</em>, 2009 ONCA 223, 243 C.C.C. (3d) 230; <em>R. v. Jorgge</em>, 2013 ONCA

    v. G.V</em>., 2020&nbsp;ONCA 291, 392 C.C.C.
    (3d) 14; <em>R. v. B.L.</em>, 2021 ONCA 373, at paras. 44-47.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge committed exactly that error in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge convicted the appellant of one count of sexual assault
    under s. 271 of the <em>Code</em> relating to events in December of 2013. He
    convicted the appellant of a second count of sexual assault and one count of
    assault under s.&nbsp;266 relating to events in March of 2014. Finally, he convicted
    the appellant of one count of criminal harassment under s. 264(1) relating to
    events in April of 2014.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant on each of the charges was J.S., with whom the appellant
    had been in a romantic and sexually intimate relationship.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.S. and her mother were the only Crown witnesses. The appellant
    testified in his own defence. The trial judge noted, at the outset of his
    reasons: “There were stark contrasts between the evidence of these events
    related by the two Crown witnesses and the accused. Accordingly, credibility
    required very careful examination”. He also observed that the appellant’s
    evidence was exculpatory and accepting it, or finding it raised a reasonable
    doubt, would require acquittal on all charges.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s analysis of the credibility of the appellant’s
    evidence, his rejection of it and his finding it raised no reasonable doubt, leaned
    heavily and repeatedly on the trial judge’s inference that his evidence had
    been tailored to fit disclosure or prior evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the introductory portion of his reasons, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I found the evidence of the accused was fundamentally
    unreliable and tainted by fantasy, insincerity or both in many instances. Insincerity,
    once detected, becomes like the thirteenth chime of a clock. It cast doubt upon
    the twelve that preceded it. There were aspects of his evidence that I did
    accept but only if adequately corroborated by other sources. <span
class=Underline>On the whole, I concluded that he told the truth only where it
    suited his purpose while the remainder of his evidence was carefully tailored
    to fit, however awkwardly, the evidence of which he was aware</span>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the section of his reasons entitled “General Comments on
    Credibility”, the trial judge returned to the same impermissible reasoning. He
    stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While smoothly recounted and never lacking in complete
    confidence as to the smallest of details recalled in the most vivid terms three
    years after the fact, the tale that [the appellant] spun became increasingly
    implausible as layer upon layer of detail was added. <span class=Underline>At
    length, I reached the conclusion that [the appellant] could not be relied upon
    to tell the truth at all. He appeared to be looking to fit his evidence to the
    disclosure he had received rather than to be recalling things from his own
    lived experience</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to these general comments, applicable to the credibility assessment
    in relation to all of the charges, the trial judge used this reasoning when
    dealing with specific events. In rejecting the appellant’s version of what
    occurred in relation to the December 2013 offences, the trial judge stated: “<span
class=Underline>This was one instance and not the only one where I formed the
    view that [the appellant] sought to tailor his evidence to suit</span>”
    (emphasis added). When dealing with the offences in March 2014, the trial judge
    took the same approach: “<span class=Underline>Once again I found [the appellant’s]
    version of these events to be a product of fantasy or a deliberate fabrication
    to fit disclosed evidence. I am unable to afford any credence at all</span>” (emphasis
    added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argues that the trial judge’s error was harmless, as his reasons
    make it clear that he had numerous grounds for rejecting the credibility of the
    appellant’s evidence. The comments about the appellant tailoring his evidence should,
    in the Crown’s submission, be viewed as a mere afterthought and the curative proviso
    in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <em>Code</em> should be applied.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not persuaded by this argument. The trial judge made his
    inference of tailoring to fit disclosure a feature of his credibility
    assessment at the outset of his reasons. He returned to it as an important
    consideration in his general findings on credibility, and then repeated its
    importance in his more granular analysis of important events. The proviso will
    not be applied where the impermissible tailoring inference “appears to have
    played a large role in the trial judge’s rejection of the appellant’s version
    of what occurred”, even if there were other reasons for that rejection: <em>B.L.</em><i>,</i> at para. 50.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown fairly concedes that there is no case where this court
    has applied the proviso to uphold a conviction where this sort of error has
    occurred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <em>Jorgge</em><i>,</i> Laskin J.A. stated, at paras. 18-19:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The context for these three cases [<em>White</em><i>, <em>Schell</em></i> and <em>Thain</em>] differs from the case before us, but the underlying
    principle is the same. In those other cases, either the Crown or the trial
    judge improperly used an accused’s right to disclosure to discredit the
    accused’s testimony. In the present case, the trial judge improperly used the
    appellant’s right to be present at his trial to discredit his testimony. She
    erred in doing so.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This error figured prominently in the trial judge’s adverse
    assessment of the appellant’s credibility. Credibility was the significant
    issue at trial, in the light of the differing versions of events given by the
    appellant and the complainant. In <em>Thain</em>, at para. 38, Sharpe J.A. said
    “[t]he appellant was entitled to have his credibility fairly assessed without
    being trapped by the exercise of his constitutional rights”. Similarly, Mr.
    Jorgge was entitled to have his credibility fairly assessed without being
    trapped by the exercise of his statutory right to be present at his trial. Thus,
    his convictions cannot stand.</p>

    is ordered. Accordingly, we do not reach the sentence appeal.</p>
