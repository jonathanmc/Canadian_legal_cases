    as a means of unduly limiting expression on matters of public interest; and</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(d) to reduce the risk that
    participation by the public in debates on matters of public interest will be

  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>“expression” means any
    communication, regardless of whether it is made verbally or non-verbally,
    whether it is made publicly or privately, and whether or not it is directed at
    a person or entity. 2015, c. 23, s.&nbsp;3.</span></p>

    against whom a proceeding is brought, a judge shall, subject to subsection (4),
    dismiss the proceeding against the person if the person satisfies the judge
    that the proceeding arises from an expression made by the person that relates
    to a matter of public interest. 2015, c. 23, s. 3.</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><a name=sec137.1subsec4></a><b><span
lang=EN-CA>No dismissal</span></b></p>

  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(a) there are grounds to believe

  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(i)
    the proceeding has substantial merit, and</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(ii)
    the moving party has no valid defence in the proceeding; and</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(b) the harm likely to be or have
    been suffered by the responding party as a result of the moving party’s
    expression is sufficiently serious that the public interest in permitting the
    proceeding to continue outweighs the public interest in protecting that
    expression. 2015, c. 23, s. 3.</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><a name=sec137.1subsec5></a><strong><span
lang=EN-CA>No further steps in proceeding</span></strong></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(5)&nbsp;Once a motion under this
    section is made, no further steps may be taken in the proceeding by any party
    until the motion, including any appeal of the motion, has been finally disposed

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In brief, s. 137.1
    places an initial burden on the moving party – the defendant in a lawsuit – to
    satisfy the judge that the proceeding arises from an expression relating to a
    matter of public interest. Once that showing is made, the burden shifts to the
    responding party – the plaintiff – to satisfy the motion judge that there are
    grounds to believe the proceeding has substantial merit and the moving party <span
class=Underline>has no valid defence</span>, and that the <span
class=Underline>public interest in permitting the proceeding to continue
    outweighs the public interest in protecting the expression</span>. If the
    responding party cannot satisfy the motion judge that it has met its burden,
    then the s.&nbsp;137.1 motion will be granted, and the underlying proceeding
    will be consequently dismissed. It is important to recognize that the final
    weighing exercise under s. 137.1(4)(b) is the fundamental crux of the analysis
    … legislative debates emphasized balancing and proportionality between the
    public interest in allowing meritorious lawsuits to proceed and the public
    interest in protecting expression on matters of public interest. Section
    137.1(4)(b) is intended to optimize that balance. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Further, if one was to accede to the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Small Claims Court is a branch of the
    Superior Court of Justice. The court embodies the foundations of access to
    justice: informality, affordability, timely resolution, accessibility for
    self-represented people and active judicial engagement. By providing access to
    justice, the court has an important role in the administration of justice for
    the province. The court handles nearly half of the civil disputes in the
    province. It provides a cost-effective forum for civil disputes involving less
    than $35,000. To achieve these objectives, all questions of fact and law are to
    be determined in a summary way. Rule 1.03(1) of the <em>Rules of the Small
    Claims Court</em>, under the <em>CJA</em>, provides:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>These
    rules shall be&nbsp;<span class=Underline>liberally construed</span>&nbsp;to
    secure the&nbsp;<span class=Underline>just, most expeditious and least
    expensive&nbsp;determination</span> of every proceeding on its merits in
    accordance with&nbsp;section 25&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<i>Courts of Justice Act.&nbsp;</i>O.&nbsp;Reg.
    258/98, r.&nbsp;1.03&nbsp;(1).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These hallmarks of the Small Claims Court, as
    enshrined in its rules, are incompatible with the provisions of s. 137.1. A s.
    137.1 analysis requires the detailed process of shifting burdens with respect
    to merits, proportionality and public interest, which involves exchange of
    affidavits and cross-examinations. Motions are not encouraged in the Small
    Claims Court. The <em>Rules of Small Claims Court </em>do not provide for
    cross-examination on affidavits. Under s. 137.1, costs of an unsuccessful
    motion are presumptively full indemnity. The limit on costs for a motion in
    Small Claims Court, absent special circumstances, is $100. The limit on costs
    after trial is 15% of the award. Small Claims Court jurisdiction is limited to
    $35,000. Contrary to these limits of Small Claims Court, s. 137.1 provides
    extensive powers with respect to damages. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The s. 137.1 motion must be heard within 60 days
    and stays the underlying action. Appeals go directly to the Court of Appeal. This
    does not comply with r.&nbsp;1.03.(1) of the <em>Rules of the Small Claims
    Court</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Small Claims Court provides timely justice
    to litigants in matters under $35,000. I conclude that the legislature did not
    intend to inject complex interim proceedings into its summary process. Doing so
    would frustrate the objectives of the <em>Rules of the Small Claims Court</em>.</span></p>
