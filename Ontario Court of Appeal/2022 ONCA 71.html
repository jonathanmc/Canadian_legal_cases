    the appellant, the respondents’ liability insurer, has a duty to provide the
    respondents with a defence to a lawsuit commenced against them. The issue has a
    twist, however, because the insurer asserts that it is entitled to avoid its
    obligations under the insurance policy as a result of allegedly false representations
    made by the insured in its application for insurance – representations that
    were allegedly made conditions of the policy.</span></p>

    Underwriters of a material change in the circumstances described in the Proposal;
    or (b) void only the coverage affected by the misleading information or non-disclosure,

    that they regard this Policy as of full force and effect, save there shall be
    excluded from the indemnity afforded hereunder any Claim which has arisen or
    which may arise which is related to such information.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The Insured shall throughout the Period of
    Insurance give notice as soon as reasonably practicable of any material change
    in any fact, activity or circumstance as described in the Proposal bearing the

    a claim against Hunt and an entity called “Global++” in the United States

    on mobile devices such as cell phones. It claims that Global++ is an
    association of computer hackers, led by Hunt, which sold subscriptions for
    unauthorized derivative versions of Niantic’s games. The core of Niantic’s
    complaint is that Global++, IT Haven, Hunt and the other defendants infringed
    its copyright in its mobile applications. It alleges that the defendants
    created, distributed, and profited from “unauthorized derivative versions” of
    Niantic’s computer applications and, in so doing, incorporated “substantial
    portions of Niantic’s copyrighted computer code”.</span></p>

    need to rely on extrinsic evidence to determine the nature of the claim. The
    claim set out in Niantic’s complaint was for breach of copyright, claiming
    damages for the sale of an allegedly unauthorized derivative version of its
    electronic games. Considering extrinsic evidence would “turn what should be a
    relatively simple pleadings type motion into a trial within a trial”, he added
    that “[t]he fact that Lloyd’s relies on the evidence of an expert to support
    its position demonstrates why the Supreme Court in <i>Monenco</i> cautioned
    that a motion judge should not look to “premature evidence” ie. evidence which
    if admitted would require findings to be made before trial that could affect
    the underlying litigation.”</span></p>

    the extrinsic evidence, the application judge concluded that the appellant had
    a duty to defend the respondents. It was undisputed that IT Haven and Hunt met
    the definition of “insured”. The Niantic proceeding fell within the coverage
    afforded by the Policy because a “Wrongful Act”, as defined in the Policy,
    included any “unauthorized use or violation by the insured of any copyright […]
    in the insured’s professional business” and the definition of the insured’s
    professional business included software development. The pleadings alleged that
    the wrongful act occurred in May 2019, which fell within the period covered by
    the Policy. Finally, the motion judge found that no exclusions applied to
    negate the duty to defend the respondents in the Niantic proceeding.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>What has happened in this duty to defend
    application is what Iacobucci J. cautioned against in <i>Monenco</i>. Lloyd’s
    may be proven correct with respect to the position it has taken regarding the
    alleged misrepresentations. Once all the evidence is heard at a trial and if
    the misrepresentations are established there will be no indemnity under the
    Policy. The same may also be true with respect to the various exclusions
    emphasized as reasons why Lloyd’s should not have to provide a defence to the Applicants.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant contends that the Policy contained
    an obligation to accurately describe IT Haven’s business at the time of the
    application for insurance (i.e., the “Proposal”) and to disclose material
    changes in the business at the time of each annual renewal. It submits that IT
    Haven and Hunt made material misrepresentations about the nature of IT Haven’s
    business in the application for insurance when they stated that IT Haven: (1)
    did not provide products or services to the electronic games industry; (2)
    derived 100% of its gross revenues from Canada; (3) always used written
    contracts with its clients; and (4) had not incorporated software or products
    designed by others into its work. Relying on Clause 4.9, the appellant also submits
    that the Policy specifically excluded coverage for claims arising from
    undisclosed material changes to any fact, activity or circumstance described in
    the application for insurance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that, even without the
    extrinsic evidence, the questions in the application form were material to the
    risk accepted by the underwriters and, based on the pleadings and the Policy
    alone, the claim did not fall within the Policy. It submits that the
    application judge (a) failed to consider the entire Policy, which incorporated
    statements in the application for insurance that the respondents (i) did not
    provide products or services to the electronic games industry, (ii) did not
    incorporate software or products designed by others into their own designs, and
    (iii) did not generate US revenue; and (b) failed to give effect to exclusions
    in the Policy, including the Material Information clause, and to the Renewal Conditions
    Endorsement. The appellant submits that a claim for breach of copyright in
    relation to the electronic games industry in the United States is manifestly
    inconsistent with the respondents’ description of their business in the application
    for insurance and is plainly excluded from coverage.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the alternative, the appellant submits that
    when non-disclosure or misrepresentation is at issue, extrinsic evidence can
    and should be considered by the court in determining whether the insurer has a
    duty to defend. Had the extrinsic evidence been considered, the application
    judge would have found that the respondents misrepresented the nature of their
    business and the Material Information clause would have excluded the insurer’s liability.
    Ultimately, the appellant submits that the respondents made material
    misrepresentations about their business and it would be commercially unfair to
    require the appellant to defend claims arising from their involvement in the US
    gaming industry when it did not agree to underwrite such risks.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondents submit that the application
    judge correctly identified and applied the “pleadings rule” and that, even
    assuming this were a proper case in which to admit extrinsic evidence, the
    evidence proffered is contested and does not clearly and unambiguously exclude
    coverage. The mere possibility of coverage is sufficient to trigger the duty to
    defend. In this case, a claim for copyright infringement brought in the United
    States in relation to software development was clearly covered by the Policy
    and, equally clearly, the appellant owed a duty to defend.</span></p>

    the pleadings allege facts which, if true, would require the insurer to
    indemnify the insured in respect of the claim, the insurer must provide a
    defence”: Gordon G. Hilliker, <em>Liability Insurance Law in Canada</em>, 7<sup>th</sup> ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis Canada, 2020), at p. 111; see also <em>Nichols v.
    American Home Assurance Co.</em>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 801, at p. 810; <em>Panasonic
    Eco Solutions Canada Inc. v. XL Specialty Insurance Company</em>, 2021 ONCA 612,
    at para. 22. The duty to defend is therefore broader than the duty to
    indemnify, because it is triggered by the mere possibility of coverage: <em>Panasonic</em>,
    at para. 22, citing <em>Monenco</em>, at paras. 28-29.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In considering whether the facts pleaded fall
    within the policy, the court must consider the substance and true nature of the
    claim: <em>Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyd’s of London v. Scalera</em>, [2000] 1
    S.C.R. 551, at paras. 50, 79; <em>Monenco</em>, at paras. 34-36.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The pleadings must be interpreted broadly, with
    any doubt being resolved in favour of the insured. Where the claim alleges
    facts that <span class=Underline>might</span> fall within coverage, the duty to
    defend arises: <em>Panasonic</em>, at para. 22; <em>Monenco</em>, at paras.
    31-33.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the rule, the court may look only
    to the provisions of the insurance policy and to the pleadings in the
    underlying action to determine whether the insurer has a duty to defend the
    insured: Mark G. Lichty &amp; Marcus B. Snowden, <em>Annotated Commercial
    General Liability Policy</em>, loose-leaf (2021-Rel. 2) (Toronto: Thomson
    Reuters Canada Ltd., 2021), at §12:22; <em>Monenco</em>, at para. 28. In a
    typical duty to defend case, the issue can be addressed by determining whether
    the claim, on the face of the pleadings, “falls within” the policy coverage or
    is plainly excluded by the policy language.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The onus is on the insured to establish that the
    allegations made by the plaintiff, if proven, would bring the claim within the
    four corners of the policy. Once that threshold is met, the onus shifts to the
    insurer to show that the claim falls outside the coverage provided by the
    policy, because of an applicable exclusion clause: <em>Trafalgar Insurance Co.
    of Canada v. Imperial Oil Ltd.</em> (2001), 57 O.R. (3d) 425 (C.A.), at para.

lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As with many rules, there are exceptions to the
    pleadings rule. One such exception permits the court to consider documents,
    such as contracts, expressly referred to in the pleadings in the underlying
    action: see Hilliker, at p. 114. Another permits the court to give effect to an
    exclusion clause in the policy where it clearly and unambiguously excludes coverage: <em>Progressive Homes</em>, at paras. 19, 51; <em>Monenco</em>, at para. 29. It
    has also been suggested that the court may consider extrinsic evidence of
    “underlying facts” where those facts are unrelated to, and not disputed in, the
    underlying action: see Hilliker, at p. 121; Lichty &amp; Snowden, at §12:22; Craig
    Brown <em>et al.</em>, <em>Insurance Law in Canada</em>, loose-leaf (2021-Rel.
    8) (Toronto: Thomson Reuters Canada Ltd., 2021), at §18:15; <em>1540039 Ontario
    Limited v. Farmers’ Mutual Insurance Company (Lindsay)</em>, 2012 ONCA 210, 110
    O.R. (3d) 116, at paras. 26, 30. This appears to be based on the proposition
    that there can be no prejudice to the insured in so doing.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Two reasons have been identified for judicial
    reluctance to consider extrinsic evidence to resolve duty to defend
    applications at an early stage. First, as observed by the application judge, the
    use of extrinsic evidence to determine whether the insurer owes the insured a
    duty to defend could require findings of fact or the resolution of live issues
    in the underlying litigation. This could operate to prejudice the insured in the
    underlying litigation and could potentially result in inconsistent findings in
    the underlying litigation on the one hand, and the insurance dispute on the
    other. As well, the findings of fact made on the application could ultimately
    be “contrary to the evidence tendered on the full record at trial”: <em>Family
    and Children’s Services of Lanark, Leeds and Grenville v. Co-operators General
    Insurance Company</em>, 2021 ONCA 159, 457 D.L.R. (4th) 714, at para. 60,
    citing <em>Monenco</em>, at paras. 36-37.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second reason to exclude extrinsic evidence
    when determining whether the insurer has a duty to defend arises out of the practical
    need for an expeditious determination of the issue: <em>McLean (Litigation
    Guardian of) v. Jorgenson</em> (2005), 78 O.R. (3d) 308 (C.A.), at para. 5. It
    reflects a concern for fairness to the insured, who may be left stranded, without
    a defence to the third party’s action, while the insurer contests its liability
    under the policy. It has been observed that for this reason a duty to defend
    application should not become a “trial within a trial”: <em>Monenco</em>, at
    para. 37; <em>Halifax Insurance Co. of Canada v. Innopex Ltd.</em> (2004), 72
    O.R. (3d) 522, at paras. 1, 39, 55.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I have noted above, the appellant would have
    us treat this as a typical duty to defend case, because the Policy incorporates
    the representations made in the application. I do not accept that
    characterization.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On its face, Niantic’s claim falls within the
    Policy. It is a claim for the violation of Niantic’s copyright, committed in
    the performance of the “Insured’s Professional business”, which included the
    development and design of software.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Unlike a typical duty to defend case, the
    appellant’s claim here is that the insured made misrepresentations in the
    application for insurance and breached a policy condition that required it to
    inform the insurer of any material change in the information set out in the
    application. Thus, the appellant says that it had no duty to defend, because
    Niantic’s claim alleges that IT Haven engaged in activities it represented it
    was not engaged in – participating in the computer gaming industry in the

    Maciorowski</em> (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 595 (C.A.) is instructive in cases such
    as this. The insured was sued for damages arising out of a motor vehicle
    accident. He had pleaded guilty to impaired driving and operating a motor
    vehicle with a blood alcohol level over 80 milligrams. The insurer denied
    coverage for the third-party claim on the ground that the insured had breached
    a number of policy and statutory conditions and added itself as a statutory
    third party to the action. The motion judge dismissed the insured’s motion for
    a declaration that he was entitled to a defence of the action at the insurer’s
    expense. This court, speaking through Catzman J.A., dismissed the appeal, but
    did not accept the principle articulated by the motion judge that there was an
    automatic suspension of the duty to defend on the insurer’s allegation of a
    breach of condition and its addition as a statutory third party.</span></p>

    asserts a breach of condition by the insured, and where that assertion is
    unchallenged by the insured and there are no grounds for raising estoppel
    against the insurer or statutory relief from forfeiture, “the insured is
    disentitled both to indemnity under the policy and to the costs of a defence”:
    at para. 15, citing Craig Brown &amp; Julio Menezes, <em>Insurance Law in
    Canada: A Treatise on the Principles of Indemnity Insurance as Applied in the
    Common Law Provinces of Canada</em>, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1991), at p.
    252. He noted, however, that the reported appellate decisions in Canada had not
    been uniform on the issue of whether the duty to defend arises in the context
    of an alleged breach of condition. He also observed that although there was
    some inconsistency in the case law of this province as to whether a motor
    vehicle insurer added as a statutory third party has a duty to defend, the
    preponderance of authority favoured the approach taken by the motion judge.</span></p>

    hard and fast rule for determining whether an insurer is required to provide a
    defence where the insurer alleges a breach of condition, but rather the court
    should adopt a flexible approach. Depending on the circumstances, a hard and
    fast rule might be unfair to either the insured or to the insurer. A rule that
    the insurer was never obliged to defend once it alleged breach of condition
    would be unfair to an impecunious insured. Conversely, a rule that
    automatically required the insurer to defend in spite of the breach of
    condition could work to the prejudice of the insurer, which provided a defence
    to an impecunious insured, but was unable to recover the costs from the insured
    after the breach of condition was made out. He concluded, at paras. 35-37:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>With respect, I do not place much confidence
    in the solution suggested in [<em>Featherstone v. Zurich Insurance Co.</em> (1991), 6 O.R. (3d) 639 (Gen. Div.)], endorsed in [<em>Laughlin v. Sharon High
    Voltage Inc.</em> (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 101 (Gen. Div.)] and followed in [<em>Colitti
    v. Popp</em> (1998), 20 C.P.C. (4th) 363 (Ont. Gen. Div.)], that the tort
    action should be put on hold while the breach of condition issue is decided
    &quot;on an expedited basis&quot;. That solution may be practical where the
    issue admits of summary disposition: where the breach of condition is clear and
    the case for estoppel or relief from forfeiture unmeritorious or, conversely,
    where the breach of condition is technical or insubstantial and the case for
    estoppel or relief from forfeiture overwhelming. But in the many cases that are
    not clear - where the alleged breach of condition, the basis of the alleged
    estoppel or the grounds for relief from forfeiture are in serious dispute and
    require the testimony of witnesses and the resolution of conflicting evidence -
    there seems to me to be no justification for compelling the trial of the
    plaintiff's tort action to await the final disposition of the breach of
    condition issue.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, rather than establishing an immutable
    legal principle, I would suggest that the question should be determined upon
    consideration of the circumstances of each case, including the relative
    strength of the positions asserted by the insurer and the insured and the
    necessity and urgency to furnish the insured with a separate defence.</span></p>

    D</span><span lang=EN-CA>ê</span><span lang=EN-CA>schenes J.A. identified a

    para. 24:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I would adopt the approach taken by the
    Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>Longo</i>. The decision whether to suspend the
    insurer's duty to defend the underlying action against its insured, pending the
    determination of the question of an alleged breach of condition of the policy,
    must be informed by certain considerations which, in turn, depend on the facts
    of each case. In my view, the relevant factors are numerous and, without being
    exhaustive, relate to such questions as:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>• Is the breach of condition contested and, if
    so, on what basis? Is the existence of the breach in serious dispute?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>• Is it reasonable to expect that the question
    of the breach of the condition can be dealt with summarily, on an expedited
    basis? If so, what are the facts supporting such an expectation?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>• Despite a clear breach of statutory
    condition, are there circumstances that militate in favor of relief from
    forfeiture under the <em>Act</em>? Are such circumstances in serious dispute?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>• If the insured invokes estoppel by reason of
    the insurer's conduct, what are the circumstances being relied upon? Is the
    question of estoppel in serious dispute?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>• What is the status of the main action
    against the insured? Has discovery been held? Has a date for trial been
    secured? If not, when is the main action likely to be heard?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>• What is the nature of the conflict between
    the insured and the insurer? For example, what are the specific reasons that
    prompted the insurer to deny indemnity and to apply to be added as a third
    party under the <em>Act</em>?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>• Is the language used in the third party
    defence filed by the insurer congruent with the language of the statement of
    defence filed by the insured on his or her own behalf? (Although I hold the
    view that an insurer is not entitled to file a statutory third party defense
    that is incongruent with its insured's interest, it is not necessary to deal with
    the issue in this case.)</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>• If the conflict between the insurer and its
    insured is not apparent on the face of the third party defence, is the conflict
    such as to require, in any event, separate and independent counsel to
    adequately represent the interest of the insured? If so, why?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>• What is the particular financial position of
    the defendant? Is he or she capable of assuming the costs of independent
    counsel until the issue of the breach of condition is resolved?</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, when the parties to a dispute such
    as this one appear before the court, they should adduce sufficient evidence to
    allow the judge to make an informed decision. Thus, the position advocated by
    Optimum's counsel and adopted by the application judge to restrict the inquiry
    to a consideration of the statement of claim and the insurance policy to
    resolve the question of the duty to defend was wrong in law. Mr. Drane was
    entitled to adduce evidence, which supported his position, and so was Optimum,
    in order to put the application judge in a position to make an informed
    decision pertaining to the factors just enumerated.</span></p>

    decision to recognize the duty to defend and compel the insurer to appoint separate
    and independent counsel to represent the interests of the insured in the third
    party action: the insured contested the insurer’s allegations of breach of
    policy terms and statutory conditions; there was no evidence concerning whether
    the insurer’s statutory third party defence in the underlying action was
    congruent with the position taken by the insured in that action; there was a
    clear conflict between the position taken by the insurer and the insured on the
    issue of whether the insured was a passenger in the vehicle (as he alleged) or
    whether he was the driver (as the insurer alleged); the record did not disclose
    any information that the alleged breaches of the policy or statutory conditions
    could be adjudicated summarily; the record did not disclose any information
    allowing one to believe that the insured had sufficient income or assets to
    assume the costs of obtaining counsel until the question of the alleged breach
    of condition was resolved; and there was no evidence as to the status of the
    underlying action.</span></p>

    misrepresentation case, rather than one of breach of condition, because the
    breach of condition is founded on the existence of a misrepresentation. However,
    the flexible approach of <em>Longo</em> is appropriate in determining whether
    the appellant has a duty to defend in this case. In each case, the issue is
    whether the actions of the insured have invalidated coverage that would
    otherwise be applicable on the face of the policy, given the nature of the claim
    in the underlying litigation.</span></p>
