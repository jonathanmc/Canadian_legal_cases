    and 5 months consecutive for child pornography, based on the totality principle.

    are governed by s. 679(3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The applicant must satisfy

lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>R. v. Oland</em>, 2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1&nbsp;S.C.R.
    250, at paras. 23-26, the Supreme Court endorsed the framework for evaluating
    the public interest criterion set out in <em>R. v. Farinacci</em> (1993), 86
    C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.), [1993] O.J. No.&nbsp;2627. The public interest
    criterion has two components: public safety and public confidence in the
    administration of justice. With respect to the public’s confidence in the
    administration of justice, the competing interests of enforceability and
    reviewability must be balanced. As Arbour J.A. said in <em>Farinacci</em>, at
    paras. 41-43:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The “public interest” criterion in s.
    679(3)(c) of the <em>Code</em> requires a judicial assessment of the need to
    review the conviction leading to imprisonment, in which case execution of the
    sentence may have to be temporarily suspended, and the need to respect the
    general rule of immediate enforceability of judgments.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Public confidence in the administration of
    justice requires that judgments be enforced. The public interest may require
    that a person convicted of a very serious offence, particularly a repeat
    offender who is advancing grounds of appeal that are arguable but weak, be
    denied bail. In such a case, the grounds favouring enforceability need not
    yield to the grounds favouring reviewability.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On the other hand, public confidence in the
    administration of justice requires that judgments be reviewed and that errors,
    if any, be corrected. This is particularly so in the criminal field where
    liberty is at stake. Public confidence would be shaken, in my view, if a
    youthful first offender, sentenced to a few months’ imprisonment for a property
    offence, was compelled to serve his or her entire sentence before having an
    opportunity to challenge the conviction on appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Oland</em>, Moldaver J. elaborated on <em>Farinacci</em>’s
    approach to the public interest criterion. He noted, at paras. 31-32, that an
    appeal judge hearing an application for bail pending appeal should consider the
    factors stipulated for bail pending trial under s.&nbsp;515(10)(c) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, with necessary modifications to account for the fact that the
    conviction has displaced the presumption of innocence. In the pre-trial context
    the onus is on the Crown to establish that an accused should be detained in
    custody, but the onus rests on the applicant to establish that he should be
    granted bail pending appeal: at para. 35. The factors to be considered are: the
    apparent strength of the prosecution’s case; the gravity of the offence; the
    circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence; and the fact that the
    accused is liable, on conviction, for a potentially lengthy term of
    imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moldaver J. explained how, with appropriate
    modifications, the public confidence factors listed in s. 515(10)(c) are to be
    taken into account by the appeal judge in identifying the factors that make up
    the public confidence component in s.&nbsp;679(3)(c).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, when considering the public confidence
    component under s. 679(3)(c), “the seriousness of the crime for which a person
    has been convicted should… play an equal role in assessing the enforceability
    interest”: <em>Oland</em>, at para. 37. An appeal judge should have regard to
    the sentencing judge’s reasons, and not repeat that evaluation afresh: <em>Oland</em>,
    at para. 38.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, Moldaver J. considered the “reviewability
    interest”, which he identified as “the strength of the prosecution’s case (s.
    515(10)(c)(i))”: <em>Oland</em>, at para. 40. In the appellate context, this
    translates into an evaluation of the strength of the grounds of appeal. In
    assessing the reviewability interest, an appeal’s strength plays a “central
    role”. Specifically, Moldaver J. endorsed the view expressed by Trotter J.A. in
    his article entitled, “Bail Pending Appeal: The Strength of the Appeal and the
    Public Interest Criterion” (2001) 45 C.R. (5th) 267, at p. 270, where he
    explained:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[R]ealistically, most cases do not raise
    strong claims regarding the public interest, at least not beyond the general
    concern that all criminal judgments ought to be enforced.... However, when an
    offence is serious, as with murder cases, such that public concern about
    enforceability is ignited, there should be a more probing inquiry into the
    chances of success on appeal. It is in this context that the balancing required
    by <em>Farinacci</em> requires some assessment of the merits, separate from the
    question of whether the appeal is frivolous or not. [Footnotes omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moldaver J. added that judges should “examine
    the grounds identified in the notice of appeal with an eye to their general
    legal plausibility and their foundation in the record” and consider whether those
    grounds “clearly surpass the minimal standard required to meet the ‘not

    reviewability factors, the appeal judge must balance them, keeping “in mind
    that public confidence is to be measured through the eyes of a reasonable
    member of the public”: <em>Oland</em>, at para. 47. This reasonable member of
    the public “is someone who is thoughtful, dispassionate, informed of the
    circumstances of the case and respectful of society’s fundamental values.” There
    is no precise formula, but a “qualitative and contextual assessment is required”:
    at para. 49. However, Moldaver J. observed that where the conviction is for “murder
    or some other very serious crime, the public interest in enforceability will be
    high and will often outweigh the reviewability interest, particularly where
    there are lingering public safety or flight concerns and/or the grounds of
    appeal appear to be weak”: at para. 50.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant raised five grounds of appeal. The
    primary ground of appeal, which was argued at length, concerns the proper
    interpretation of s. 172.1(1)(b). This section provides:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>172.1(1) Every person commits an offence who,
    by a means of telecommunication, communicates with</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(b) a person who is, or who the accused
    believes is, under the age of 16 years, for the purpose of facilitating the
    commission of an offence under section 151 or 152, subsection 160(3) or 173(2)
    or section 271, 272, 273 or 280 with respect to that person; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The offence alleged to have been facilitated in
    this case is sexual assault under s. 271. The applicant argues that “the trial
    judge erred in treating the offence of child luring pursuant to section
    172.1(1)(b) in this circumstance as ‘luring’ for the purpose of any of the
    enumerated offences, rather than the specific offence of ‘sexual assault’ as pleaded
    in counts 1 and 2 of the Information.” I will elaborate on the applicant’s
    argument below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second ground of appeal is that the trial
    judge erred in law by convicting the applicant “on the standard of <em>recklessness </em>when assessing whether the essential element of <em>knowledge </em>of the
    individual’s age was proven beyond a reasonable doubt, while <em>recklessness </em>cannot
    be a substitute for knowledge in these particular offences” (emphasis in
    original).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The third ground is that the trial judge erred
    in law “by constructively treating the failure to take reasonable steps to
    determine the age of the complainant as an independent pathway to conviction.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fourth ground is that the trial judge failed
    to “actively engage with the steps and perceptions of someone acting in [the ‘<em>Daddy-Dom-Little-Girl</em>’
    online] community”, with its distinctive set of rules and roles, as providing a
    defence regarding the complainant’s age.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fifth ground is that the trial judge erred
    by improperly taking “subjective notice of the complainant’s age by using his
    own independent observations of her in court and the exhibit evidence to
    conclude that a reasonable observer would only view this individual as a
    ‘prepubescent child’, and treating the <em>mens rea </em>of these offences as
    being objective in nature.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the strongest ground of appeal is
    the first one, and I will focus on it in these reasons. The other grounds are
    much weaker, and their cumulative force adds little. That said, “the ‘not
    frivolous’ test is widely recognized as being a very low bar”: <em>Oland</em>,
    at para. 20. I am satisfied that the appeal is not frivolous.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before his conviction, the applicant was on bail
    for several years, and compliance was not an issue. The Crown does not oppose
    the bail provisions.</span></p>

    find the public safety concern to be negligible. The applicant has a strong
    incentive to abide by the terms of any release, as he did in complying with his
    pre-trial bail, given the appeal. I am satisfied that the applicant has
    demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that he is not a public safety
    threat and will not likely commit further offences if released on bail pending
    his appeal.</span></p>

    confidence in the administration of justice requires that judgments be enforced”: <em>Farinacci</em>, at para. 42. Several factors in this case weigh heavily in
    favour of enforceability and against the release of the applicant. The
    seriousness of the crime, as noted in <em>Oland</em>, figures in the assessment
    of the enforceability interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant was convicted </span><span
lang=EN-CA>of </span><span lang=EN-CA>egregious child luring under s.
    172.1(1)(b) on two counts, “for the purpose of facilitating the commission of
    an offence of sexual assault,” and on one count of making child pornography
    contrary to s.&nbsp;163.1(2). At sentencing, the trial judge found: “</span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>In this particular case, the child luring
    committed by [the applicant] was particularly serious and involves a high level
    of moral blameworthiness.” However, he added: “While the communications were
    graphic and continued, I did not find the offender was grooming the child to
    eventually meet. He was using her for online sexual gratification.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge pointed out several aggravating
    factors, including “the length of time the luring went on, the existence of an
    actual 13 year old victim, which was expressly conveyed to [the applicant] by
    the girl and the officer posing as the girl and yet he failed to desist, and
    the transmission of sexually explicit material, including a video of himself
    masturbating to a real 13 year old child”. He concluded: “in the circumstances,
    the sentence, even for a first offender, must be a penitentiary term, even if… it
    is imposed in the period of the Covid pandemic.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also referred to mitigating
    factors, noting the absence of a prior record, a positive pre-sentence report, the
    applicant’s history of secure employment, and “a supportive family who are
    aware of the offences.” He considered positively that the applicant “has
    undertaken some counselling and is prepared to continue with counselling.” The
    trial judge noted: “There appears to be genuine remorse for the consequence of
    his actions.” Despite these mitigating factors, the trial judge saw fit to impose
    a significant penitentiary sentence of 41&nbsp;months.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To conclude, in my view the enforceability

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Reviewability</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moldaver J. noted in <em>Oland</em>, at para.
    40, that the strength of the appeal plays a central role in assessing the
    reviewability interest. In my view, while a preliminary assessment of the
    strength of the appeal reveals that the grounds of appeal are arguable, they do
    not “<span class=Underline>clearly surpass</span> the minimal standard required
    to meet the ‘not frivolous’ criterion” (emphasis added): <em>Oland</em>, at
    para. 44.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Strength of the Appeal</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted above, the applicant’s main argument is
    that “the trial judge erred in treating the offence of child luring pursuant to
    section 172.1(1)(b) in this circumstance as ‘luring’ for the purpose of any of the
    enumerated offences, rather than the specific offence of ‘sexual assault’ as pleaded

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In other words, the applicant takes the position
    that the Crown was obliged to prove the mental element or <em>mens rea</em> attached to sexual assault in order to get a conviction. The applicant asserts
    that because the trial judge found that he “had intended never to meet with the
    complainant because he valued his anonymity”, it was therefore “impossible [for
    him] to have ‘facilitated’ the offence of a sexual assault”. Putting it in
    other words: “The purpose of the communications could never have been intended
    to facilitate the commission of the offence of sexual assault, if there was
    never an intention to meet in person.” The applicant cites the Supreme Court
    for the proposition that: “the accused must be shown to have ‘engage[d] in the
    prohibited communication with the <span class=Underline>specific intent</span> of facilitating the commission of one of the designated offences’ with respect
    to the underage person who was the intended recipient of communication”
    (emphasis in original): <em>R. v. Legare</em>, 2009&nbsp;SCC 56, [2009] 3
    S.C.R. 551, at para. 32, citing <em>R. v. Alicandro</em>, 2009&nbsp;ONCA&nbsp;133,
    95 O.R. (3d) 173.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, in my view the applicant overstates the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge found a reasonable doubt that the applicant was
    working towards a meeting with the 13-year-old complainant. He said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The prospect of a meeting is not the <em>sine
    qua non </em>of the offence as contemplated by s. 172.1 of the<em> Code</em>.
    Even when no meeting is arranged, an<em> </em>accused can “facilitate” a sexual
    offence with a<em> </em>young person.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The accused may have spoken about a meeting in
    Kingston to continue the narrative and he may have ultimately arranged to meet
    the young person if the communications had continued, but I accept his
    communications with the young person at that stage were part of the narrative
    only and he wanted this to be an online anonymous relationship. In his
    conversation with Detective Wohlert, it was the Detective who was driving the
    meeting discussions. The accused did not terminate that discussion and, as I
    said, <span class=Underline>he may have ultimately wished to meet the young
    person, but he has raised a doubt that he had intentions at that time to meet
    the young person</span>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Contrary to the applicant’s assertion, the trial

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant highlights para. 32 of Fish J.’s
    reasons in <em>Legare</em>, which I more fully quote here:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he intention of the accused must be
    determined </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>subjectively</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>.... As Doherty J.A. stated in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Alicandro</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at para. 31, the accused must be shown to have “engage[d] in the
    prohibited communication with the </span><span class=Underline><span
lang=EN-CA>specific intent</span></span><span lang=EN-CA> of facilitating the
    commission of one of the designated offences” with respect to the underage
    person who was the intended recipient of communication. [Italics and
    underlining in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, these words must be taken in context
    with para. 25, which initiates and conditions the ensuing discussion, including
    para. 32:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It will immediately be seen that s. 172.1(1)(c)<em> </em>creates an incipient or “inchoate” offence, that is, a preparatory crime
    that captures otherwise legal conduct meant to culminate in the commission of a
    completed crime. It criminalizes conduct that <em>precedes </em>the commission
    of the sexual offences to which it refers, and even an attempt to commit them.
    Nor, indeed, must the offender meet or intend to meet the victim with a view to
    committing any of the specified secondary offences. This is in keeping with
    Parliament’s objective to close the cyberspace door before the predator gets in
    to prey. [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I note that in <em>R. v.</em> <em>Morrison</em>,
    2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3, Moldaver J. cited <em>Legare</em> and affirmed,
    at para. 40, that “[t]here is no requirement that the accused meet or even
    intend to meet with the other person with a view to committing any of the
    designated offences”. See also Professor Hamish Stewart’s article, “<em>Legare</em>: <em>Mens Rea</em> Matters” (2010) 70 C.R. (6th) 12. Both counsel agree that
    they were unable to find any cases that take the approach the applicant proposes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not say the applicant’s case is
    frivolous. But it is weak in view of Fish&nbsp;J.’s clear language in para. 25
    of <em>Legare</em>. It is not the <em>mens rea</em> of the specified offence
    sought to be facilitated – in this case sexual assault – that the Crown must
    prove. It is sufficient for the Crown to prove facilitation itself, which “includes <em>helping to bring about and making easier or more probable</em> – for example,
    by ‘luring’ or ‘grooming’ young persons to commit or participate in the
    prohibited conduct; by reducing their inhibitions; or by prurient discourse
    that exploits a young person’s curiosity, immaturity or precocious sexuality”
    (emphasis in original):<em> Legare</em>, at para. 28.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Discussion</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I turn to the factors to be balanced. I see the
    Crown’s position in the appeal as strong, and the applicant’s as weak. These
    vile crimes are grave, and the applicant has been sentenced to a lengthy term
    of imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While it is relatively rare for a bail pending
    appeal application to be resolved on public confidence considerations, this is
    one of the “difficult cases ... in which the public confidence component is
    raised”: <em>Oland</em>, at para. 30. The interest in enforceability is very
    strong. The interest in reviewability is not.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ultimately, although the reviewability interest
    still supports release, the applicant’s conviction on three serious counts
    mitigates the strength of the reviewability interest. In short, the
    enforceability interest outweighs the reviewability interest in this case. Were
    the applicant to be released pending appeal, I have no hesitation in concluding
    that a reasonable member of the public, informed of the egregious
    circumstances, would lose confidence in the administration of justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    sentence will have been largely served before the appeal is resolved. I therefore
    order that the appeal be expedited, pursuant to s. 679(10) of the <em>Criminal
