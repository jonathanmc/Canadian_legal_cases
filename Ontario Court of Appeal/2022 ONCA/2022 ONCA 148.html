lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>This appeal concerns the appellant’s
    failed real estate purchase from the respondent, Patrick Brey, and its claim
    for damages and the return of its $25,000 deposit held by the listing agent, the
    respondent, Grapevine Realty Inc., who took no position on the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The narrow issue on appeal is
    whether the motion judge erred in her interpretation of the deadline provisions
    for raising off title objections, which were contained in paragraph 8 of the agreement
    of purchase and sale between the appellant and the respondent Brey, and by
    determining that the deadline for the requisitions at issue was August 26, 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The appellant submits that
    the motion judge erred by failing to consider paragraph 8 in its entirety. The
    appellant argues that a proper reading of paragraph 8 places the ultimate
    deadline as five days prior to the October 1, 2019 closing date, namely,
    September 26, 2019. As such, the appellant’s objections were timely and the
    respondent Brey’s refusal to respond to them allowed the appellant to terminate
    their agreement. The appellant asks that the motion judge’s judgment be set
    aside and that the appellant be granted judgment with costs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=normaltextrun><span style='color:black'>The
    respondent Brey submits that the motion judge made no error in her
    interpretation of the agreement and the factual matrix. In the alternative, if
    the appellant is successful on its one ground of appeal, the respondent Brey argues
    that this court must also decide the following: (1) was the appellant’s objection
    on present use invalid; (2) is the appellant estopped or otherwise barred from claiming
    relief with respect to the present use of the property; and (3) does the
    appellant’s post-closing conduct affect this appeal?</span></span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The appellant’s offer to
    purchase the respondent Brey’s property was accepted in July 2019. The listing
    described the property as a fourplex. The closing date was scheduled for
    October 1, 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Paragraph 8 sets out the deadline
    for raising objections, as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>8. TITLE SEARCH: Buyer shall be allowed until
    6:00 p.m. on the 16 day of September, 2019 (Requisition Date) to examine the
    title to the property at Buyer’s own expense and until the earlier of: (i)
    thirty days from the later of the Requisition Date or the date on which the
    conditions in this Agreement are fulfilled or otherwise waived or; (ii) five
    days prior to completion, to satisfy Buyer that there are no outstanding work
    orders or deficiency notices affecting the property, and that its present use (Residential
    Fourplex) may be lawfully continued and that the principal building may be
    insured against risk of fire.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>On July 26, 2019, the
    appellant waived conditions pursuant to Schedule A of the agreement of purchase
    and sale. On September 26, 2019, the appellant’s real estate solicitor received
    a compliance report from the City of Ottawa that could not confirm the lawful use
    of the property as a fourplex. The report noted that “[t]here are no building
    permit records to establish a four-unit apartment dwelling, low-rise unit at
    this location. Our building permit records indicate a three-unit dwelling.” The
    report also noted that a previous owner had not arranged for all required
    inspections relating to a building permit issued for construction of a rear
    addition. On September 26, 2019, the appellant’s solicitor wrote to the
    respondent Brey’s solicitor requisitioning a copy of permits and final inspections
    from the City to confirm that the property’s use could lawfully be continued as
    a fourplex, as well as inspection reports relating to the rear addition. The
    respondent Brey’s real estate solicitor declined to respond, taking the position
    that the objections were made beyond the deadline provided for in paragraph 8
    of the agreement of purchase and sale.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The transaction did not
    close on the scheduled October 1, 2019 date. The respondent Brey resold the
    property to another buyer at a lower purchase price. The appellant brought a
    claim for the return of its deposit and damages. The respondent Brey
    counterclaimed for damages incurred because of the failed transaction with the appellant.
    The appellant and the respondent Brey brought competing motions for summary
    judgment before the motion judge.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Summary Judgment</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The motion judge examined
    paragraph 8 of the agreement of purchase and sale that provided for a formula
    to determine the deadline date for making title and off title objections. She determined
    that the deadline for the appellant to make any objections regarding the legal
    use of the property as a fourplex and any outstanding inspections under paragraph
    8 was August 26, 2019. She arrived at this date by rejecting the first date provided
    for under part (i) of the formula, namely, October 16, 2019, to avoid a commercial
    absurdity. She explained in para. 59 of her reasons that: “It would be absurd to
    interpret para. 8 as setting a deadline for [the appellant] to raise objections
    that was later than the closing date [October 1, 2019]. By that time, the sale
    would be complete, and title would be transferred.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Accordingly, the motion
    judge determined that “on a plain reading of the section”, August 26, 2019, which
    was 30 days from the date that conditions were waived, was the deadline date because
    it was “earlier than September 26, the date derived from the formula in (ii).” The
    motion judge found that, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 10 of the
    agreement of purchase and sale, the appellant was deemed to have accepted the
    respondent Brey’s title because the objections were not raised in time. As a
    result, the motion judge found that the appellant “did not have the option of
    refusing to close the purchase without breaching the contract”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The motion judge concluded
    that her finding of the August 26, 2019 deadline resolved all contractual
    claims between the parties. She dismissed the appellant’s motion for summary judgment
    and granted judgment to the respondent Brey in the amount of $52,216.65,
    including the appellant’s $25,000 deposit, plus costs of $50,000, inclusive of
    fees and applicable taxes.</span></p>

    reproduce paragraph 8 of the agreement of purchase and sale, with the relevant requisition
    deadline provisions underlined:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>8. TITLE SEARCH: <span class=Underline>Buyer
    shall be allowed</span> until 6:00 p.m. on the 16 day of September, 2019 (Requisition
    Date) to examine the title to the property at Buyer’s own expense and <span

    the principal building may be insured against risk of fire. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The deadline for making the
    paragraph 8 objections was crucial because of the serious consequences that
    would flow from either meeting or failing to meet the deadline, as provided for
    in paragraph 10 of the agreement of purchase and sale. Paragraph 10 provided
    that if the respondent Brey failed to “remove, remedy or satisfy” “any valid
    objection to title or to any outstanding work order or deficiency notice, or to
    the fact the said present use may not lawfully be continued”, which was made
    within the deadline provided for in paragraph 8, the agreement of purchase and
    sale would be at an end and the deposit would be returned to the appellant. However,
    it also stipulated that, “[s]ave as to any valid objection so made by such day and
    except for any objection going to the root of the title, [the appellant] shall
    be conclusively deemed to have accepted [the respondent Brey’s] title to the
    property.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>The motion judge properly
    instructed herself that, as this court directed in&nbsp;<em>Ventas, Inc. v.
    Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust</em>, 2007 ONCA 205, 85 O.R.
    (3d) 254, at para. 24, a commercial contract should be interpreted “as a whole,
    in a manner that gives meaning to all of its terms and avoids an interpretation
    that would render one or more of its terms ineffective”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Unfortunately, the motion judge
    failed to follow these directives. By rejecting the October 16, 2019 date in
    part (i) of paragraph 8 as commercially absurd, the motion judge failed to
    consider and give effect to the entirety of the paragraph, as she was required
    to do. When the paragraph is viewed in its entirety, there is nothing
    commercially absurd about the October 16th date. It is merely one factor to
    consider in the entirety of the formula set out in paragraph 8 to determine the
    requisition deadline.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Paragraph 8 provides for a choice
    between the earlier of two dates under parts (i) and (ii). In properly interpreting
    the entirety of the paragraph, it is necessary first to ascertain “the later”
    of the two dates provided for in part (i), namely, October 16th (30 days from
    the requisition date of September 16th) and August 26th<sup> </sup>(30 days
    from the appellant’s waiver on July 26th). The later date is October 16th.
    Moving next to part (ii), the date is “five days prior to completion” (October 1st
    closing date), that is, September 26th. The earlier of October 16th and September
    26th, is September 26th. September 26th is prior to the October 1st closing
    date. When read in its entirety, paragraph 8 does not yield any commercial absurdity.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>September 26, 2019 was the
    correct deadline for the appellant to make the off-title requisitions specified
    in paragraph 8 of the agreement of purchase and sale, including with respect to

    the City of Ottawa supports the validity of the appellant’s objection regarding
    the lawful use of the property as a fourplex. Among other information, the City
    of Ottawa’s September 26, 2019 Compliance Report advised that conformity of the
    present use of the property as a fourplex could not be verified and noted: “There
    are no building permit records to establish a four unit apartment dwelling, low-rise
    use at this location. Our building permit records indicate a three-unit
    dwelling.” Moreover, the evidence given by Patrick Edward Kennedy, a City of
    Ottawa Program Manager of Building Inspections for Central East Division, was
    that the present use of the property as a fourplex is not permitted. During the
    cross-examination on his affidavit, Mr.&nbsp;Kennedy confirmed his
    understanding that the permitted use of the property was a three-unit apartment
    dwelling and that he was unaware that the property had been sold as a fourplex.
    He confirmed that a building permit would be required to add a fourth apartment.
    In his second affidavit filed following his cross-examination, Mr. Kennedy deposed
    that he ascertained on a visit to the property with a building inspector that
    there is a fourth apartment and that he advised the current owner that the
    property would have to be returned to a three&#8209;unit apartment building or
    she would have to obtain a building permit for the fourth unit. He also stated
    that an Order to Comply has been issued instructing the owner to submit an
    application and plans and take all steps necessary to obtain a building permit,
    or submit an application and plans and take all steps necessary to return the building
    back to its last known permitted use.</span></p>
