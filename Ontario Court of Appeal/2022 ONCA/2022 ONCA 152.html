  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown points out that J.R. has been
    convicted of serious violent offences and a lengthy sentence has been imposed. The
    Crown claims that given his breach of a bail condition, public confidence in
    the administration of justice requires his detention. The Crown submits that
    the breach indicates that the bail plan is no longer reasonable as the surety
    is no longer appropriate, and in the balancing analysis, the enforceability
    interest now outweighs the reviewability interest. Alternatively, if this court
    determines that J.R.’s detention is not justified, the Crown proposes a new pledge
    from J.R. of $10,000, and a new weekly reporting term in addition to the terms
    that were in force in the October 28, 2021 order for bail pending appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.R. claims that the circumstances under which
    this breach occurred do not require his detention in custody pending appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He claims there are no new public safety
    concerns resulting from his breach. He says he had no intention to contravene
    his bail terms, and that with his own illness and his worry about his fiancée’s
    more serious illness (discussed further below), he was “a bundle of nerves” and
    simply forgot that his fiancée had to be with him if he left his home at that
    time of night. J.R.’s account of the reason for his whereabouts is corroborated
    by his fiancée and by the cellphone records. He also notes that at the time of
    his breach, his fiancée was extremely ill.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.R. further claims that under these
    circumstances, his release pending appeal would not shake public confidence in
    the administration of justice. In addition to the requirements imposed on him
    in the bail terms set out in the October 28, 2021 bail order, if this court
    orders release, J.R. proposes a weekly reporting term (rather than a monthly
    reporting term), and agrees to pledge the sum of $10,000.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><u><span lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>The
    Circumstances of this Breach</span></u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.R. concedes that he breached his bail
    conditions by leaving his home without his fiancée after his 10 p.m. curfew. He
    claims, however, that he was under serious stress as his fiancée had been ill and
    had not eaten for three days with what they believed to be COVID-19 (although she
    was later diagnosed with thrush), and he himself was unwell with a nasal
    infection. In his affidavit in support of this bail application J.R. notes, “I
    was very worried because [my fiancée] had not been eating for days, and we
    thought she might have Covid.… [N]either of us were thinking of the bail
    condition when I drove to get the pizza. We were both rather scared by [my
    fiancée]’s condition.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is evidence to support this account of J.R.’s
    whereabouts and his reasons for leaving his home after 10 p.m. J.R.’s fiancée’s
    cellphone records corroborate his assertion that he called Pizza Pizza’s
    general number, 905-527-1111. At 12:51 a.m, he called for Hamilton Pizza Pizza
    locations and was told they were closed. Then, at 1:05 a.m., J.R. called the
    same number and was informed that the outlet in Burlington was still open but
    that they would not deliver. It is approximately 13.3 miles from his home. At
    2:22 a.m., Pizza Pizza left a voicemail message on his fiancée’s phone asking
    why he had not picked up the pizza he had ordered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The following day, J.R. and his fiancée attended
    a walk-in clinic. His fiancée was not allowed to enter the clinic in case she
    had COVID-19, and told a nurse her symptoms over the phone. J.R. was allowed
    into the clinic to pick up a prescription for his sinus infection.</span></p>

  <p class=Heading><u><span lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>Analysis of the
    Public Safety and Public Confidence Factors</span></u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Breach of a bail condition is a very serious
    matter. For the purposes of maintaining public safety and public confidence, it
    is important that applicants released pending appeal comply with the conditions
    of their release.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In rare cases, where extenuating circumstances exist,
    persons that have failed to adhere to a bail condition may nonetheless satisfy
    their onus to justify their release on bail pending appeal. Those cases should
    be exceptional and should not involve otherwise illegal activity.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is one such case. Against the backdrop of
    the coronavirus epidemic, J.R. was ill and very worried about his fiancée (and
    surety’s) more serious medical illness. J.R. left to get food for her. While it
    was wrong not to adhere to the condition that he remain in the home, I accept
    that J.R. was scared and not thinking clearly. I do not believe he set out to
    breach his bail. Moreover, while J.R.’s surety was in the home when he left,
    she was very ill. I do not take this isolated act, when viewed in the context
    of her illness, to necessitate a change in surety.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.R.’s breach was not intended to, nor did it
    result in, an otherwise wrongful or illegal activity, nor did it pose a
    “substantial likelihood” of J.R.’s committing a further offence or interfering
    with the administration of justice. It is therefore distinguishable from the
    two cases cited by the Crown which resulted in revocation of bail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Specifically, unlike the accused in <em>R. v.
    Manasseri</em><i>, </i>2015 ONCA 3, 329 O.A.C. 156, J.R. did not breach his
    bail conditions by impermissibly contacting a witness and suggesting he needed
    someone to contradict the witness’s evidence at trial. Nor, like the accused in <em>R. v. Castellano</em>, 2021 ONCA 272, did he breach his bail order by possessing
    such items as ammunition, break-in instruments, stolen property and an explosive
    substance and being charged with offences related to the offence for which he had
    been convicted. Moreover, there is no suggestion, as there was in <em>Castellano</em>,
    that the first bail pending appeal application was a “close case” as to whether
    the applicant had established that the reviewability interest outweighed the
    enforceability interest in the public confidence analysis. In this case, the
    bail pending appeal order was issued on the consent of both parties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As such, from the perspective of an informed member
    of the public who understands our bail system, reviewing the facts of this case,
    and considering the need to respect the general rule of enforceability of orders,
    I do not believe public confidence in the administration of justice would be
    impaired if J.R. were granted bail pending appeal on new terms, given the
    unusual circumstances in which J.R. breached his bail conditions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, given the reasons for the breach, the
    nature of the breach, and the fact that this is the only breach of a bail term
    while J.R. has been on bail for four years, I am satisfied that there is no “substantial
    likelihood” of him committing an offence or interfering with the administration
    of justice, such that J.R.’s bail pending appeal would jeopardize “the
    protection or safety of the public”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There must, however, be some adjustment to the
    release terms in light of the breach in order to further support compliance,
    and I agree with the new terms proposed by the parties. J.R. shall report
    weekly to the authorities instead of monthly, as he was required to do pursuant
    to the order of October 28, 2021, and he shall personally pledge $10,000. This
    is in addition to the terms the parties agreed to in the order of October 28,
    2021.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    satisfied his onus to show cause why his detention is not justified
    notwithstanding his breach of his bail condition: s.&nbsp;524(4).</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE THIRD ISSUE: WHETHER J.R. MUST BE
    ARRESTED BEFORE BEING RELEASED ON BAIL PENDING APPEAL</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.R. was arrested for failing to comply with a
    release order. He was, however, released by the arresting officer on an
    undertaking. Accordingly, J.R. is currently out of custody.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits that whether or not J.R. may
    be ultimately released on a new bail pending appeal, this court does not have
    jurisdiction to revoke the October 28, 2021 order until it issues a warrant for
    arrest and committal and J.R. is in custody. The Crown relies on this court’s
    decisions in <em>R. v. U.(F.J.)</em> (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 408 (Ont. C.A.),
    and <em>R. v. La</em>, 2018 ONCA 85, in support of its submission. In these
    cases, this court held that it did not have jurisdiction to revoke a bail order
    where the appellant had not been arrested and brought before a judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view however, where an appellant is not in
    custody and a new application for release on bail pending appeal is heard at
    the same time as the Crown’s application to revoke bail, the “modifications
    that the circumstances require” envisaged by s. 679(6) may, in exceptional
    circumstances, allow for the revocation of bail pending appeal pursuant to s.
    524(3), and the ordering of a new bail pending appeal under s. 524(5), without
    having to first issue an arrest warrant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the bail revocation sections of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> were amended in 2019, s. 679(6), which, then and now, incorporates
    these sections into the bail pending appeal regime, continues to use the “with
    any modifications that the circumstances require” wording. Specifically, s.
    679(6) now provides that “Sections 495.1, 512.3 and 524 apply, with any
    modifications that the circumstances require, in respect of any proceedings
    under this section.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 524(1) addresses the situation of
    bringing an accused person “before a justice” where the accused person is
    believed to have contravened an order. In the case of bail pending appeal, ss.
    524(1) and (2) are typically engaged when the Crown brings an application to a
    Court of Appeal judge for an arrest warrant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>If J.R. were in custody, this court would have
    jurisdiction to revoke his bail order without the need to issue an arrest
    warrant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is because in <em>R. v. Dallaire</em> (2001), 141 O.A.C. 65 (C.A.), at para. 13, Laskin J.A. held that when an
    appellant is in custody and is represented by counsel on the Crown’s revocation
    application, the appellant is “before the court” for the purpose of the
    revocation application, and a further arrest warrant is not necessary. In
    coming to this conclusion, Laskin J.A. relied on the wording of s. 679(6),
    which stated that the bail revocation sections applied “with such modifications
    as the circumstances require”. He held that, “In the circumstances of this
    case, I modify the applicable provisions of s. 525 [now s. 524] by dispensing
    with the need to issue an arrest warrant” before cancelling the bail order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I find that the circumstances of this particular
    case are exceptional and warrant this modification. In other words, I am of the
    view that J.R. should not be required to be arrested and held in custody before
    this court can cancel his current bail pending appeal order and make a new
    release order. This is because, first, J.R. has had notice of the application
    to revoke his bail pending appeal. He was arrested and charged for failing to
    comply with the bail pending appeal order and was then released on his own
    recognizance. He has been represented by counsel on the applications before the
    court. Second, J.R. conceded that he contravened his release order, his new
    bail hearing took place at the same time as the bail revocation hearing, and I
    came to the decision that his detention was not justified. Third, the new bail
    pending appeal order will come into effect forthwith. And importantly, fourth, in
    these exceptional times of COVID-19, it is in the public interest to avoid, if
    possible, unnecessary time in custody.</span></p>
