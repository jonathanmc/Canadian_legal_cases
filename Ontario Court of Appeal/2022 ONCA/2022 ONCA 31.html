  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On December 3, 2018, Mr. N pleaded guilty to possessing
    and accessing child pornography, and received a sentence of 14 months’
    imprisonment, followed by 2 years’ probation. He now asks this court to set
    aside his guilty plea and the ensuing convictions on the basis that his pleas
    were uninformed. Mr. N claims that at the time his pleas were entered, he was
    unaware of legally relevant collateral consequences that bear on sufficiently
    serious legal interests; specifically, he claims that upon conviction he was
    unaware that he would be subject to an order to comply with the <em>Sexual
    Offenders Information Registry Act</em> for life, pursuant to s. 490.013(2.1)
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (“SOIRA order”), and would be
    ineligible to apply for a criminal record suspension, pursuant to the <em>Criminal
    Records Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-47. He asserts that had he been aware of
    these collateral consequences, he would not have pleaded guilty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed
    the appeal with reasons to follow. We now provide our reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not need to address the Crown’s submission
    that Mr. N’s plea could not be rendered uninformed as the collateral
    consequences he identifies do not bear on sufficiently serious legal interests: <em>R. v. Wong</em>, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1&nbsp;S.C.R. 696. Mr. N’s appeal must
    fail because, when the whole of the evidence is considered, he has not presented
    credible evidence establishing a reasonable possibility that he would not have
    pleaded guilty had he been aware of these collateral consequences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During cross-examination on his affidavit filed
    in support of this appeal, Mr.&nbsp;N acknowledged that his “three very big
    concerns” before deciding to plead related to his wish to get home to his
    family as soon as possible, whether any defences were available to him, and his
    wish to receive the lowest possible sentence. The case against Mr. N was
    overwhelming and left no room for defences, and he was so advised by trial
    counsel. His pleas of guilty addressed the remaining concerns. It is unlikely, given
    that his “very big concerns” were addressed including by the pleas he entered,
    that he would not have pleaded guilty had he been aware of the collateral
    consequences he now identifies.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the duration of the <em>SOIRA</em> order came up twice during the sentencing hearing. On both occasions it was
    made clear that the <em>SOIRA</em> order would be for life. First, the trial
    judge discussed the issue with counsel at the outset of sentencing submissions.
    At the closing of submissions, Mr. N was asked by the trial judge whether he
    had anything to say. He expressed his remorse but said nothing about the <em>SOIRA</em> order that was about to be imposed. Second, the trial judge discussed the
    duration of the <em>SOIRA</em> order with counsel when he was about to impose
    the order. At that time, Mr. N’s trial counsel was given the opportunity to
    comment on the order but declined to do so. Had the implication of the <em>SOIRA</em> order been material to Mr. N when he entered the pleas, he or his trial counsel
    would have made this known to the court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to his ineligibility for a record
    suspension, prior to entering his pleas Mr. N signed written plea instructions
    that recited, “I understand that as a result of my plea I will have a criminal
    record”. There can be no doubt that if the possibility of a criminal record suspension
    was of importance to Mr. N’s decision to plead guilty, he would have raised it
    at that time, but he did not do so. The first mention of eligibility for a
    record suspension between Mr. N and his trial counsel occurred after he was sentenced,
    notwithstanding that Mr. N. had raised other issues with trial counsel before
    deciding to plead guilty. In all of the circumstances, there is no credible
    basis for finding a reasonable possibility that had Mr. N known he would be
    ineligible to apply for a record suspension, he would not have pleaded guilty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In these circumstances Mr. N has not met the
    onus he bears. It is for these reasons that his appeal was dismissed.</span></p>
