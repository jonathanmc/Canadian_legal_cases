  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the sentences imposed by Justice Edward J.
    Koke of the Superior Court of Justice on September 6, 2017, with reasons
    reported at 2017 ONSC 5203.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 9, 2016, the appellants were convicted of sexual assault of the
    complainant, C.R. On September 6, 2017, G.F. was sentenced to three and one&#8209;half
    years’ incarceration and R.B. was sentenced to three years’ incarceration. On
    June 14, 2019, this court allowed their appeal against conviction and ordered a
    new trial.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> As a result, this court did not address the appellants’ sentence appeal. The
    Crown then successfully sought leave to appeal that decision to the Supreme
    Court of Canada. On May 14, 2021, that appeal was allowed, and the appellants’
    convictions were restored.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Consequently, this court is now called upon to hear and decide the sentence
    appeals. For reasons that need not be detailed, the parties’ written
    submissions, that were filed a few months ago, were only recently received by
    the panel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts underlying the convictions are set out in detail in this
    court’s earlier reasons and in the reasons of the Supreme Court of Canada. They
    do not need to be repeated in detail. The appellants were convicted of engaging
    in the sexual assault of a 16-year-old complainant at a campground. The
    complainant was there with her parents and her younger brother. Her parents and
    the appellants were friends. The complainant had been provided with alcohol by
    G.F. and was intoxicated at the time of the sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In terms of personal background, G.F. was born in the United Kingdom and
    immigrated to Canada when he was six years old. He never sought Canadian
    citizenship. He was 42 years old at the time of the offence. He had no criminal
    record. R.B., upon her graduation from high school, entered the workforce and
    always maintained gainful employment. She was 38 years old at the time of the
    offence. She also had no criminal record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge noted that both counsel
    agreed that deterrence and denunciation are primary objectives in sentencing
    for offences such as those committed by the appellants. In terms of aggravating
    circumstances, the trial judge noted:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the complainant was only 16 years old, and both of the appellants
    were more than twice her age;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the complainant was under the influence of alcohol and most of
    the alcohol she drank was given to her by G.F. without the consent or approval
    of her parents;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the sexual activity was a violation of trust. The complainant’s
    parents trusted that their 16-year-old daughter would be treated with respect
    and consideration when they agreed to let her sleep in the trailer with the two
    appellants;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the sexual activity took place without any protection. This
    naturally gave rise to concerns about STIs and pregnancy; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the extent of the sexual activity was not “low-end conduct”. The
    appellants manipulated the complainant into several physical positions, over
    the course of some time, and the complainant was “completely objectified and
    degraded as a sexual object”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In terms of mitigating factors, the trial judge noted that neither of
    the appellants had a criminal record; they did not have any history of
    inappropriate conduct with young persons; and they were both hardworking
    individuals. The trial judge was concerned, however, by the fact that neither
    of the appellants had accepted any responsibility for their conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown had sought a four year custodial sentence for G.F., and a
    three year custodial sentence for R.B. The appellants both sought two year
    suspended sentences, with three years’ probation. As earlier noted, the trial
    judge imposed a sentence of three and one-half years on G.F. and three years on
    R.B.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise a number of complaints with respect to the trial
    judge’s approach to the sentences. These include:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge used his own personal objection to the type of
    conduct involved, that is, group sexual activity along with sexual activity
    involving persons of very different ages, to increase the sentence;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge’s use of the appellants’ failure to take
    responsibility penalized them for maintaining their innocence;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge erred in finding that there was a breach of trust
    involved in this case;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge did not adequately distinguish between the appellants’
    relative culpability;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge erred by failing to consider collateral
    immigration consequences for G.F.;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the trial judge erred by failing to consider collateral
    consequences for R.B. involving her history of mental health issues; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the sentences were outside the range for similarly situated
    offenders.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept any of these complaints. In particular, while we accept
    that some of the language used by the trial judge in describing the sexual
    activity was inappropriate and unnecessary, we do not view it as having
    impacted the ultimate sentences imposed. We believe that it was open to the
    trial judge to find that there was an element of a breach of trust in this case
    given the particular circumstances. In that regard, we note that trust
    relationships can arise in varied circumstances and they fall along a spectrum: <em>R. v. Friesen</em>, 2020 SCC 9, 391 C.C.C. (3d) 309, at para. 125. The
    immigration consequences were not ones that could have driven the appropriate
    sentence down to the point where they would have had any impact. Immigration
    consequences cannot be used to justify the imposition of inappropriate and
    artificial sentences: <em>R. v. Pham</em>, 2013 SCC 15, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 739, at
    para.&nbsp;15.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In advancing their argument about similarly situated offenders, the
    appellants have relied on case law that does not reflect facts that are similar
    to the ones here. The Crown points to a collection of different cases more
    closely resembling the facts of this case, which justify a sentence in the
    range of three to four years. It is this reality that often makes reference to
    other cases of limited use in determining an appropriate sentence. What is
    important is that the sentences imposed in this case are clearly far from being

    appellate court may only interfere with a sentence if the sentencing judge
    erred in principle, failed to consider a relevant factor or erroneously considered
    an aggravating or mitigating factor, and the error had an impact on the
    sentence: <em>R. v. Lacasse</em>, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para.
    44. The appellants have failed to show that any of these errors occurred in
    this case.</p>

    our view, the trial judge imposed sentences that were proportionate to the
    activities underlying the offences committed. His differentiation between the
    two appellants in terms of sentencing was reasonable and is entitled to deference.</p>
