</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thomas Straub is a dangerous offender. Many
dangerous offenders receive the most extreme and clearest form of preventive
sentence that our law permits, a sentence of indeterminate detention in a
penitentiary. Thomas Straub is not among them. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge at Thomas Straubs
dangerous offender hearing concluded that the public could be adequately
protected against Thomas Straubs violent recidivism by a sentencing
disposition less than a sentence of indeterminate detention. The judge imposed
a composite sentence: imprisonment for a term of five years, to be followed by
a long-term supervision order (LTSO) for a further ten years.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown says that the sentence imposed does
not adequately protect the public against Thomas Straubs well-established
propensity for committing violent offences against others. What is required,
the Crown contends, is a sentence of indeterminate detention in a penitentiary.
Only the most extreme and clearest form of preventive sentence will provide the
degree of protection necessary under the legislation.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These reasons explain why I agree that the
sentence imposed cannot stand. I would allow the appeal, set aside the sentence
imposed at the conclusion of the dangerous offender application and substitute
a sentence of indeterminate detention in a penitentiary.</span></p>

a knife, grabbed her from behind. He demanded her cellphone. She refused. The
respondent pushed her into a vacant building, then threw her to the floor. The
victim escaped but dropped her cellphone. The respondent picked it up and
disappeared into the interior of the vacant building. The victim suffered minor
injuries.</span></p>

two men who were across the street. They ran over to the vacant building and
went inside. They confronted the respondent who tried to stab one of them with
a knife with an eight-inch blade. The man was not injured, the blade caught on
his jacket. The respondent fled.</span></p>

several personal items. The respondent fled with the bag.</span></p>

involving the respondent and his former counsel. When counsel met with the
respondent in the cell area of the courthouse to speak with him after a court
appearance, counsel terminated the interview when she began to suspect the
respondent was masturbating as they spoke. Counsel ceased to represent the
respondent after he sent her a letter explaining about how he would break into
her house, stab her, tie her up in her bedroom, sexually assault her, abandon
her after flooding her home, and steal her car to escape.</span></p>

catalogued a lengthy history of voyeurism which began when he was eight years
old and continued throughout his adult life. He explained that his attack on
his first victim was sexually motivated, not to steal her cellphone.</span></p>

not suffer from a major mental illness. However, the doctor identified two
disorders which emerged from various tests he had administered and his own
interviews of the respondent. The first, substance use disorder, was in

</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 759(2) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>
limits appeals by the Crown from decisions made in dangerous or long-term
offender proceedings to grounds of law. In this case, the Crown says that the
sentencing judge made three errors. He failed to impose a sentence that gave
effect to the purpose of the dangerous offender regime. He failed to consider
evidence that the respondent could not be controlled in the community. And he
applied the wrong standard in deciding that a composite sentence, combining a
determinate penitentiary sentence with an LTSO, was the appropriate sentencing
disposition.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Background</span></h3>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After finding the respondent met the
requirements of ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii) to be designated a dangerous
offender, the sentencing judge turned to the penalty stage governed by ss.
753(4) and (4.1). Section 753(4.1) requires a sentencing judge to impose an
indeterminate sentence to be served in the penitentiary unless the judge is
satisfied by the evidence adduced at the hearing that there is a reasonable
expectation that some lesser sentencing measure will adequately protect the
public against the offenders commission of murder or a serious personal injury
offence.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, for all practical purposes, the
issue at the penalty stage was whether the sentencing disposition would be
detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period or a determinate term
of imprisonment of more than two years followed by an LTSO of not more than ten
years. The resolution of that question depended upon whether the evidence
adduced at the hearing satisfied the standard put in place by s. 753(4.1)  a
reasonable expectation that a lesser measure [a composite sentence of
imprisonment and an LTSO] will adequately protect the public against the
commission by the offender of murder or a serious personal injury offence.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The principal evidence that informed the penalty
decision was the evidence of Dr. Rootenberg, the forensic psychiatrist who
completed the assessment report. Dr. Rootenberg was called by the Crown at the
hearing. The defence called no evidence. The sentencing judge said that he
placed the greatest weight on Dr.&nbsp;Rootenbergs evidence in reaching his
decision on penalty.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Expert Evidence</span></h3>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his assessment report on testimony, Dr.
Rootenberg developed a composite assessment of the risk of recidivism by the
respondent. The assessment was based on actuarial and clinical factors. The
risk that the respondent would commit violent acts was high. Dr. Rootenberg was
concerned about acts involving severe violence. The respondent had a history,
the doctor pointed out, of failing to consistently follow through with or
complete treatment programs. Relatedly, the respondent failed to make stable
lifestyle choices. And the respondents chronic substance abuse exacerbated and
perpetuated his risk of violent recidivism.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Rootenberg gave evidence that the respondent
was a high risk offender. His risk of violence is chronically elevated and at
its highest in the context of active substance use, which leads to disinhibition,
impulsivity, and poor judgment.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his report and testimony, Dr. Rootenberg
considered whether some measure less than an indeterminate sentence could
adequately protect the public against the respondents violent recidivism. The
doctor characterized risk as contextual, dependent on the treatment and
supervision put in place. Because of the respondents decade long history of
offences, his risk factors, and his history of difficulties with supervision
and treatment, high levels of risk management would be necessary to manage the
respondents risk were he to be released into the community. Intensive
treatment in custody, followed by intensive supervision and further treatment
in the community were necessary to manage that risk.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In outlining the treatment and supervision which
may assist in managing the respondents risk, Dr. Rootenberg explained that the
respondent should receive an adequate dose of intensive treatment, including
cognitive behavioural therapy for his Antisocial Personality Disorder, relapse
prevention and monitoring for his substance abuse, and a structured lifestyle
to address his poor coping methods and unstable lifestyle. It was unclear
whether any treatment success would translate into an absence of recidivism in
the community without further external controls on the respondents behaviour.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his report, Dr. Rootenberg summarized his
opinion about whether some lesser measure than an indeterminate sentence could
adequately protect the public against the respondents violent recidivism in
these words:</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In summary, Mr. Straub appears to be an
individual at a high risk of violence, and there appears to be a substantial
risk that this violence may be of a serious nature. It appears that there is
the possibility of eventual control of that risk in the community on an LTSO,
but that is largely dependent upon Mr. Straub demonstrating a much more diligent
and concerted effort than he has previously demonstrated.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In assessing the reasonableness of eventual
control of the respondents risk in the community, Dr. Rootenberg listed
several factors he considered relevant:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the respondent receive federal treatment
based on RNR (risk, need, responsivity) principles;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the respondent enter the community under
supervision at a community correctional centre;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the respondents treatment continue in the
community to prevent erosion of any gains;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>iv.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the respondent be closely supervised in the
community and breached for minor infractions;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>v.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that any relapse into substance abuse be used
for further treatment of his criminogenic risk factors; and</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>vi.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the respondents risk would not be attenuated
by age at expiry of an LTSO since the acuity of a personality disorder traits
does not tend to diminish until late 40s.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Reasons of the Sentencing Judge</span></h3>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his reasons for sentence, the sentencing
judge said that he placed the greatest weight on the opinions of Dr. Rootenberg
and Dr. Arrowood in reaching his decision. He quoted Dr. Rootenbergs summary
and final opinion:</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It appears that there is the possibility of
eventual control of that risk in the community on a LTSO, but that is largely
dependent upon Mr. Straub demonstrating a much more diligent and concerted

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge focused on the respondents
actions rather than his words, because he considered the respondent not a
reliable historian. Among the factors the sentencing judge considered in
reaching his conclusion that a sentencing disposition lesser than an
indeterminate sentence was appropriate were:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the respondents interest in help reflected in
his completion of his High School Diploma while in pre-disposition custody;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the lack of any significant cognitive
difficulties which would impede the respondents ability to engage in
treatment;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the fact that the respondent had never been
sentenced to a term of federal custody, thus never had the opportunity to
benefit from the different and more intensive programming available in CSC
facilities;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>iv.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the structure and enforcement resources
available under an LTSO;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>v.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the recommendations of Dr. Rootenberg of terms
and conditions of any future release plans; and</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>vi.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the early opportunity to address the risk of

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge concluded that a lengthy
penitentiary term, together with an LTSO, was the least intrusive sentence that
could meet the enhanced sentencing objective of protecting the public. He said:</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I have considered the totality of the
evidentiary record at this hearing. I am satisfied that the overall sentence
can adequately protect the public. The respondent has the ability to

<h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Arguments on Appeal</span></h3>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown appellant alleges three specific
errors in the reasoning of the sentencing judge:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>failure to give effect to the purpose of
dangerous offender proceedings under Part XXIV of the <em>Criminal Code</em>;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>failure to consider evidence that the risk of
the respondents recidivism could not be controlled in the community; and</span></p>

<p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>failure to apply the proper standard in
determining the sentence imposed.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The purpose of Part XXIV, the Crown contends, is
to protect society from a class of offenders who are dangerous in light of
their past, present, and likely future conduct. The respondent is a high-risk
offender, a threat to the safety of the public. There is a high likelihood he
will engage in harmful recidivism. His behaviour is intractable.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentence imposed, the Crown submits,
represents a leap of faith by the sentencing judge, a hope based on
unpredictable contingencies that fail to respect the purpose of Part XXIV.
There was no evidence that the respondent could be successfully treated within
a definite period of time. He had consistently refused any available treatment
offered to him previously. The psychiatric opinion was contingent on the
respondent availing himself of available treatment. This confused the potential
to benefit from available treatment with a reasonable expectation that the
respondents risk could be managed in the community.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown says that the sentencing judge,
emphasizing the absence of any significant cognitive difficulties in the
respondent, imposed a penitentiary sentence to provide the respondent with an <em>opportunity</em>
to participate in the treatment on offer by the CSC. That the respondent, a
devoted abstainer from treatment programs, would even participate was purely
speculative. Manageability of the respondents risk depends upon him engaging
in treatment, willing to be supervised, complying with monitoring, and changing
his anti-social views. His record refutes any of these prospects.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge failed to consider evidence
that the respondents risk of recidivism could not be controlled in the
community. Risk management requires an assessment of both the treatability and
manageability of an offenders behaviour. This includes evidence of treatment
avoidance, unresponsiveness to treatment, breaches of court orders, lack of
motivation, continued involvement in high-risk conduct, or a serious
personality disorder and an elevated likelihood of violent recidivism. The
sentencing judge failed to consider the diminished strength of Dr. Rootenbergs
opinion because of the respondents conduct during the dangerous offender
hearing involving threats to assault and rape a correctional officer and his
former counsel. In addition, Dr. Rootenberg acknowledged that his opinion about
the prospect of controlling the respondent in the community depended on the
respondent actively engaging with treatment. There was no evidence the
respondent had ever done so or was even serious about doing so in the future.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown says that Dr. Rootenberg did not
support the respondents release into the community on an LTSO without
intensive treatment in the penitentiary. What was required were several years
of dedicated treatment. The sentencing judge failed to consider this
significant qualification on Dr.&nbsp;Rootenbergs opinion.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

referred to the reasonable possibility that the respondents risk could be
controlled in the community. This is not the standard that s. 753(4.1) directs
the hearing judge to apply. The standard is reasonable expectation, a higher
standard than reasonable possibility. A&nbsp;reasonable possibility
describes something that may happen. A reasonable expectation refers to a
belief that something <em>will</em> happen. Application of the wrong standard

that an indeterminate sentence be imposed on a dangerous offender unless the
evidence adduced at the hearing demonstrates a reasonable expectation that a

management, not complete elimination of the risk which would mandate an
indeterminate sentence in all cases. The sentencing decision involves the
application of the principles in the general sentencing provisions of Part
XXIII, but without losing sight of Part XXIV which assigns paramountcy to the
protection of the public. The sentencing judge repeatedly referred to the
protection of the public as the paramount principle of sentencing governing his
decision as he applied the principles enshrined in Part&nbsp;XXIII as he was
required to do.</span></p>

included the report and testimony of Dr.&nbsp;Rootenberg, neither of which was
diminished or qualified during the course of the hearing. He maintained his
emphasis on the need for intensive treatment and strenuous supervision as a
means of controlling the risk of the respondents violent recidivism. He was

an indeterminate sentence will adequately protect the public against the
defined recidivistic risk, and not reasonable possibility as Dr. Rootenberg
characterized it. The statutory standard, the respondent agrees, suggests a
likelihood or belief that something would happen, not a possibility that it
might happen. However, the respondent emphasizes that the sentencing judge
never actually used the term reasonable possibility himself. Rather, he
referred to it only when quoting from Dr.&nbsp;Rootenbergs report.</span></p>

submits, do not mandate an indeterminate sentence in all cases. The presiding
judge must still determine whether there is a reasonable expectation that a
lesser measure will adequately protect the public. In this case, the sentencing
judge examined the evidence, correctly stated the law, and determined that the
lesser measure he imposed met the standard required. He made no error in doing
so. The sentence imposed should not be disturbed.</span></p>

that must be met before a court can designate an offender, convicted of a
serious personal injury offence, as a dangerous offender. This is the
designation stage. Sections 753(4) and (4.1) govern the second stage of the
proceedings. They relate to the sentencing of dangerous offenders, the penalty
stage: <em>R. v. Boutilier</em>, 2017 SCC 64, [2017] 2&nbsp;S.C.R. 936, at

appeal to any ground of law. An assessment of evidence may amount to an error

appellant has demonstrated that the sentencing judge erred in law in concluding
that a lesser measure than an indeterminate sentence  a composite sentence 
met the standard required under s. 753(4.1) to warrant its imposition. It
follows that the deference usually due to the exercise of discretion in
sentencing falls away and permits this court to consider afresh what
constitutes a fit disposition under Part XXIV.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my respectful view, the error of law in this
case consisted of the sentencing judge assessing the whole of the evidence
against the wrong legal standard in deciding whether a lesser measure than an
indeterminate sentence satisfied the standard required by s. 753(4.1).</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I accept as a basic principle that, absent an
error of law, a judges assessment of the evidence adduced in a proceeding is
beyond the reach of appellate review; that review is limited to grounds of law:
<em>H.(J.M.)</em>, at para.&nbsp;30. On the other hand, it is an error of law
to assess that same corpus of evidence on the basis of the wrong legal
standard: <em>H.(J.M.)</em>, at para. 29.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The legal standard imposed by s. 753(4.1) for a
lesser measure than an indeterminate sentence to be imposed on the dangerous
offender is whether there is a reasonable <em>expectation</em> that the lesser
measure will adequately protect the public against commission by the offender
of murder or a serious personal injury offence. This standard refers to a <em>likelihood</em>,
a belief something will happen, not that something might happen. And that something
is that the lesser measure will adequately protect the public against the
dangerous offenders violent recidivism.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A reasonable expectation is not a reasonable
possibility. A reasonable possibility sets the bar for a lesser measure too low
to ensure adequate protection of the public. Reasonable possibility was the
standard applied by Dr. Rootenberg in reaching his conclusion.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This was also the standard adopted by the
sentencing judge in deciding that the lesser measure of a composite sentence
would provide adequate protection for the public against the respondents
violent recidivism. Granted, the sentencing judge only used the term reasonable
possibility when summarizing or quoting from Dr. Rootenbergs report. But Dr.
Rootenbergs evidence significantly informed his reasons. And the sentencing
judge determined a composite sentence was adequate on the basis of factors that
supported only an opportunity or ability to participate in treatment,
rather than any expectation that the respondent actually would.</span></p>

evidence against a less rigorous standard than s.&nbsp;753(4.1) requires. As
such, his conclusion about the adequacy of a lesser measure than an
indeterminate sentence to satisfy the required degree of public protection
cannot stand. Likewise, the composite sentence imposed to give effect to that

sentencing judge relied most heavily, was itself based on the same erroneous
standard of reasonable possibility, rather than the more stringent reasonable
expectation. Even if accepted, it cannot ascend to the standard required. All
the more so when Dr.&nbsp;Rootenberg acknowledged that the possibility of
eventual control of the high risk of violence and substantial risk of serious
violence was largely dependent on the respondent demonstrating a much more
diligent and concerted effort than he has previously demonstrated.</span></p>
