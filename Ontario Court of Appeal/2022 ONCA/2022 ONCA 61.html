  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Thorburn J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Michael J. Bellman (“Bellman”) and Kenneth D.F.
    Mac Neil (“Mac Neil”) appeal the motion judge’s order granting the respondent
    Intercap summary judgment against them (“the appellants”) pursuant to a
    guarantee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the motion for summary judgment, Intercap
    sought to enforce a debt and a guarantee signed by Bellman and Mac Neil as principals
    of the corporate debtor, Capsule Media Inc. (“Capsule”). Capsule conceded
    liability for the debt. Bellman and Mac Neil did not.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The central questions on the motion were (i) whether
    the guarantee was a continuing guarantee and (ii) whether the debt under the
    most recent loan agreement was connected with the debt under the earlier loan
    agreement, such that the appellants were responsible to repay the loan.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge held that this was a continuing
    guarantee which applied to the most recent loan agreement. He concluded that
    the guarantee “expressly contemplates that the termination of the initial loan
    agreement will not release the guarantors …. under a subsequent [loan]
    agreement” where the subsequent loan agreement is “in connection with” and arises
    from a prior loan agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge formed his decision on the
    basis of the documentary record alone and held that the parties’ subjective
    views were inadmissible. He noted however that, had he considered evidence of
    the subjective views of the parties, he would have found it incredible that the
    debt obligation would no longer be subject to the guarantee by Bellman and Mac Neil.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The central issue to be determined on this
    appeal is whether the motion judge erred in his analysis and conclusion that
    the guarantee applied to the most recent loan agreement between the parties,
    namely the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (“This Loan”) such that
    the appellants are liable to repay the funds guaranteed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before addressing the issues raised by the
    appellants, I will set out the history of the loan agreements and guarantees, and
    the terms in those agreements that are significant for the purposes of this
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE LOAN AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties are sophisticated businesspeople who
    negotiated the terms of their agreements and did not rely on standard form
    contracts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Intercap is a merchant bank that invests in
    private and public companies. Capsule is an Ontario corporation in the business
    of cloud-based media management, owned by Mac Neil’s holding company and
    Bellman’s spouse. Bellman is a former corporate lawyer with experience in
    private lending who has been involved in many loans.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><u><span lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal;font-style:

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 5, 2018, Intercap and Capsule entered
    into a loan agreement (“the First Loan Agreement”), whereby Intercap agreed to lend
    Capsule $250,000. The purpose of the loan was to repay funds to a prior lender and
    to provide general working capital. The loan agreement included a right to
    convert the loan into common shares of Capsule based on a conversion price
    formula set out in the loan agreement. The maturity date of the agreement was
    October 5, 2018.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 5, 2018, Bellman and Mac Neil provided Intercap
    with a joint and several personal guarantee of the initial $250,000 loan
    agreement (“the First Guarantee”). Paragraph 14 of the guarantee provides that
    Intercap may vary the terms and conditions of the loan without the guarantors’
    consent provided the principal amount of the loan is not increased.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the First Guarantee granted security over all
    of Bellman and Mac&nbsp;Neil's personal property, Intercap agreed that it would
    not register notice of its security interests over the appellants’ personal
    assets under the <em>Personal Property Security Act,</em> R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10
    (“PPSA”), unless Bellman and Mac&nbsp;Neil defaulted under the loan. Bellman
    acknowledged that he did not want a PPSA notice filed because registration could
    adversely affect his creditworthiness.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><u><span lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal;font-style:

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In August of 2018, it became clear that Capsule
    would not be able to repay the loan by the maturity date of October 5, 2018 and
    that it required further funds. As such, on August 27, 2018, Intercap and Capsule
    entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the “Second Loan
    Agreement”) to increase the loan amount from $250,000 to $450,000 and extend
    the maturity date from October 5, 2018 to November 6, 2018. The Second Loan
    Agreement also included a novation clause, but all other terms remained
    substantially the same.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Because the original guarantee required consent
    to increase the amount of the loan, the parties also entered into an Amended
    and Restated Personal Guarantee (“the Second Guarantee”) on August 27, 2018.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Second Guarantee provides that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Para. 1: <b>Guarantee</b>. The guarantee is
    “of all present and future debts, liabilities and obligations of the Borrower <u>arising
    out of an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement as of August 27, 2018</u> … <u>and
    any ultimate unpaid balance thereof</u>”.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Para. 2: <b>Liability Absolute</b>. The guarantee
    is “unconditional and absolute irrespective of … any amendment, waiver or other
    modification of any obligations of the Borrower or any rights of the Lender
    under any Agreements, including, without limitation, any increase in the principal
    amount thereof[.] … <u>This shall be a continuing Guarantee and shall cover all

    thereunder and shall be binding as a continuing security on the Guarantor.”</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Para. 12: <b>Continuing Nature</b>. “<u>This
    agreement shall continue and apply to any ultimate unpaid balance of the
    Guaranteed Obligations</u> and shall be reinstated if at any time payment of
    any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by
    the Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or
    for any other reason whatsoever, all as though such payment had not been made.”</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Para. 14: <b>Dealings by the Lender</b>. “The
    Lender, may from time to time (i) <u>renew, terminate and otherwise vary any of
    the terms and conditions of any loans;</u> … all as the Lender may see fit,
    without prejudice to or in any way limiting or lessening the liability of the Guarantors
    under this agreement and without obtaining the consent of or giving notice to
    the Guarantors.… The Lender covenants and agrees that it will not increase the
    principal amount of the Loan without the prior written consent of both
    Guarantors.”</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Para. 19: <b>Entire Agreement</b>. “No

    novation and entire agreement clauses in This Loan are not relevant, as paragraph

    otherwise vary any of the terms and conditions of any loans … all as the Lender

    of a continuing guarantee is that it does not reference a specific loan
    agreement, the appellants rely on authorities that feature “continuing all accounts”
    guarantees. An “all accounts” guarantee extends to all debts owing or that may
    become owing to the creditor, whereas a continuing guarantee covers a series of
    transactions: McGuinness, at paras. 7.5, 15.43-15.44. While most continuing
    guarantees are also all accounts guarantees, this is not necessarily always the

lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the Second Guarantee specifically

    argument that the Second Guarantee was not a continuing guarantee. At paragraph
    66 of his reasons the motion judge held that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There is nothing ambiguous about a continuing
    guarantee that is limited to future liabilities that are incurred “in
    connection with” a specific agreement. It means strictly what it says. If
    Intercap and Capsule do other business or if, for any reason, Capsule owes
    money to Intercap in future that is not incurred in connection with the first
    amended and restated loan agreement, then the guarantee is not engaged and the
    guarantors have no liability to pay. But <u>if future liabilities are incurred
    by Capsule in connection with the first amended and restated loan agreement,
    then the guarantors are liable and must pay</u>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He noted that the recital in This Loan provides
    that This Loan is “amend[ing] and restat[ing] the [Second Loan Agreement] by
    [This Loan]” and that, by the time This Loan was executed, the entire loan
    amount had been advanced and interest had accrued. He therefore concluded that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>It is perfectly clear that [This Loan] is
    extending, amending, and restating the same debt</span></u><span lang=EN-CA> as
    referred to in the [Second Loan Agreement]. There is no fresh advance. The
    advances are specified as the prior advances. Moreover, the accrued interest is
    recognized as accrued and continuing. The securities hold ran from the first
    agreement and not this agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I find that the debt under [This Loan] is

    This Loan, paragraph 14 of the Second Guarantee permits Intercap to “terminate”
    and “otherwise vary” the terms of any loans “without prejudice to or in any way

lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants point to the fact that a new guarantee
    was entered into when the Loan amount was increased from $250,000 to $450,000.
    This, they say, supports their argument that a new guarantee must be executed
    and that any obligations under the prior loan agreement are extinguished.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not agree. The Second Guarantee was
    executed because the principal amount of the loan was increased from $250,000
    to $450,000. The First Guarantee specifically required that consent must be
    obtained from the borrowers before increasing the principal amount of the loan
    and as such, a Second Guarantee had to be executed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When This Loan was executed, by contrast, the
    principal amount of the loan was not increased and there was therefore no need
    to enter into a new guarantee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, as noted by the motion judge, this
    case is distinguishable from <em>Dhawan v. Shails et al.</em>, 2018 ONSC 7116
    (Div. Ct.), cited by the appellants. In <em>Dhawan</em>, the language of the
    guarantee was ambiguous because of internal inconsistency. The same clause
    limited the scope to obligations “arising under or in connection with” a
    specific promissory note and also provided that “this shall be a continuing
    guarantee and shall cover all of the obligations now or hereafter existing and
    shall apply to and secure any ultimate balance due or remaining due to the
    Lender.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, by contrast, the Second Guarantee
    clearly contemplates that liability will continue even if the Second Loan
    Agreement is terminated provided liability is “in connection with” the Second
    Loan Agreement and the principal amount of the loan is not increased, which for
    the reasons set out above, I find it was. The terms of the Second Guarantee are
    unambiguous.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In sum, a review of This Loan and the Second Guarantee
    as a whole, giving the words their ordinary and grammatical reading, consistent
    with the objectives of the parties, leads to the conclusion that this is a
    continuing guarantee and that the liabilities under This Loan are connected to
    the liabilities under the Second Loan Agreement. The motion judge did not err
    in his application of the principles of contractual interpretation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, although the Second Loan Agreement was
    terminated and replaced with This Loan, the Second Guarantee enables Intercap to
    recover “all such liabilities incurred before or after” execution of the Second
    Guarantee “in connection with” the Second Loan Agreement, to secure any
    ultimate balance remaining.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><u><span lang=EN-CA>The Second Issue: Ambiguity and the Motion
    Judge’s Use of Extrinsic Evidence</span></u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the alternative, the appellants claim the
    provisions in the Second Guarantee are ambiguous and that, (i) where
    contractual provisions are ambiguous, the courts may consider extrinsic
    evidence to determine the scope and subject matter of the guarantee and, in any
    event, (ii) any ambiguity should be construed against the party who drafted the
    agreement, that is, the lender.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted above, I find the wording in the Second
    Guarantee is clear and unambiguous. Moreover, This Loan and the Second
    Guarantee contain entire agreement clauses such that all terms are set out in
    the written agreements.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, even if the wording were ambiguous and
    extrinsic evidence were to be considered, the extrinsic evidence does not
    support the appellants’ assertion that it, “went to the objective basis for how
    the appellants believed (and how Intercap could have believed) the Second
    Guarantee was limited to the Second Loan Agreement.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant Bellman provided an affidavit in
    which he states that, for the First Guarantee, he negotiated the inclusion of
    specific reference to the First Loan Agreement. He claims that the language
    that the guarantee refer to a specific loan was maintained in the Second
    Guarantee. This, he says, was to ensure that the guarantees would be specific
    to the loan agreements. I note however that, contrary to this assertion, the signed
    copy of the Second Guarantee provides that, “This shall be a continuing
    Guarantee and shall cover … all such liabilities incurred before or after the
    date hereof in connection with the [Second Loan] Agreement … and any ultimate
    balance due or remaining due to the Lender thereunder.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, Bellman said that in April 2019, when
    Intercap proposed extending the maturity date for the loan in exchange for
    acquiring a one-third interest in Capsule, Bellman told Intercap that he and
    Mac Neil would either provide personal guarantees or one-third of the company,
    but not both. However, Bellman admitted in cross-examination that there was no
    evidence in writing of this ultimatum and that Intercap never responded to it
    “other than to say that was not how they sought to proceed.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Bellman asserted that subsequently, in the weeks
    leading up to the execution of This Loan, Intercap never mentioned guarantees but
    spoke only about acquiring a one-third interest in Capsule. However, he said
    that,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I decided to include language in Section 7.02
    that following execution Intercap would discharge all PPSA registrations
    against Mac Neil and me, but that it could refile upon a default. My rationale
    was that if Intercap was waiting to demand personal guarantees, this comment
    would force its hand. Alternatively, if Intercap had accepted the Extended
    Conversion Right in lieu of personal guarantees, that this would elicit a
    response accordingly.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Intercap replied to Bellman’s proposal, indicating
    that it required that the proposed language in s. 7.02 be removed, “as the PPSA
    registrations against Bellman and Mac Neil personally shall continue in place
    until paid out (to minimize the risk of there being an intervening registration).”
    Bellman consented to Intercap’s requested changes, incorporating them into This
    Loan. Bellman asserted:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>An hour or so prior to execution, Meretsky
    circulated an email … that, among other things, advised Intercap of the expiry
    dates of its PPSA registrations against Capsule, Mac Neil, and me. I did not
    give it much (if any) consideration because I considered the PPSA registration
    to be without any purpose from a legal perspective.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no reason for Bellman to include this
    proposed language permitting Intercap to refile the </span><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:"Arial-ItalicMT",sans-serif'>PPSA<i> </i></span><span
lang=EN-CA>notices against Bellman and Mac Neil if the Second Guarantee was no
    longer in effect. If the Second Guarantee was no longer in effect, the </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:"Arial-ItalicMT",sans-serif'>PPSA<i> </i></span><span
lang=EN-CA>notices would have been discharged as of right (and could not have
    been refiled on default) because Intercap’s security interest arose from the Second
    Guarantee. Moreover, it is difficult to understand why a sophisticated
    businessperson like Bellman would consider “the PPSA registration to be without
    any purpose from a legal perspective.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In any event, Intercap rejected Bellman’s
    proposed language and instead chose to maintain its PPSA registrations against
    Bellman and Mac Neil, pursuant to the Amending Agreement, which amended the Second
    Guarantee. This is evidence that the Second Guarantee remained in effect.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In short, Capsule had received two prior rounds
    of funding and had not paid any of the funds on three different maturity dates.
    Moreover, as noted above, although Bellman stated that prior to executing This
    Loan, he proposed that Intercap receive either a larger interest in Capsule or
    personal guarantees, but not both, there is no written confirmation of this
    ultimatum and Bellman himself acknowledged that Intercap did not respond to it
    “other than to say that was not how they sought to proceed.” He also asked for the
    PPSA registrations to be withdrawn unless there was another default. On July
    15, 2019, this was refused by Intercap. In his affidavit, at para. 70, Bellman
    claims Intercap insisted on keeping its PPSA registrations although they knew
    they were of no effect.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is not plausible that, as Capsule’s financial
    situation weakened, Intercap would release the guarantee without further
    negotiation. If the company failed (and it had failed to repay money on three
    earlier maturity dates), it was important to ensure that its security interests
    against the guarantors’ personal assets remained perfected by registration. Whether
    or not Intercap obtained one-third of Capsule upon default, there is no reason
    why it would give up the right to collect on the personal guarantees.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As such, even if the extrinsic evidence of
    Bellman were admissible, it does not support the conclusion that this was not a
    continuing guarantee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, notwithstanding the able
