  <p class=Endorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Bijan Naghshbandi, appeals from
    judgments in two actions involving the collection of debts claimed by the
    respondents, Shahram Heidari and his company, Tarra Engineering Inc. (“TEI”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the first action, <em>Heidari v. Naghshbandi</em>,
    the trial judge ordered the appellant to pay Mr. Heidari $173,544 plus interest
    and costs. In the second action, <em>Tarra Engineering Inc. v. Naghshbandi</em>,
    the trial judge ordered the appellant to pay TEI $105,810 plus interests and
    costs and dismissed the appellant’s counterclaim against Mr. Heidari, TEI, and
    Tarra Engineering and Structural Consultants Inc., another company established
    by Mr. Heidari.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In essence, the appellant advances five grounds
    of appeal against the judgments.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, he submits that the trial judge decided
    the actions against him on a new theory of liability. The appellant maintains
    that the trial judge introduced a joint investment claim that was not pleaded
    and was not the subject of evidence or submissions at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not agree with this submission.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Heidari and TEI claimed repayment of money
    lent to the appellant. The appellant denied that any loans were advanced to
    him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that Mr. Naghshbandi
    arrived in Canada with few or no resources and relied on loans or capital
    invested by others to support himself. The trial judge did not accept the
    appellant’s evidence that loans had not been made by Mr. Heidari and accepted
    Mr. Heidari’s evidence to the contrary. He properly characterized credibility
    as the central issue at trial. Indeed, the parties agreed that the litigation
    turned on credibility. Although the trial judge had reservations regarding
    certain aspects of Mr. Heidari’s testimony<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
    he found him to be a generally honest man. In contrast, he found the appellant
    to be particularly mendacious. As the trial judge stated at para. 203:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Naghshbandi's credibility was pitted
    against that of every other witness in this trial. His testimony amounted to a
    series of denials and allegations which were not corroborated by any other
    witness. He was not a credible witness…</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While some of the funds had been advanced to the
    appellant for the purposes of a joint investment, they were nonetheless loans
    by Mr. Heidari that were to be repaid by the appellant. The basis for the trial
    judge’s determination was not a new theory of liability. We see no error in the
    trial judge’s treatment of this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge failed to provide adequate reasons for the appellant’s liability for the
    debts arising from the joint investments.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge gave reasons for decision that
    were 52 pages in length that were then supplemented by additional reasons
    following receipt of further submissions. He explained that the funds were
    advanced so that the appellant could invest in real estate and there were cheques
    and emails that supported his finding. He had to determine in part whether the
    payments were made to the appellant for his sole benefit, for Mr. Heidari’s
    sole benefit, or for their joint benefit. He explained why he decided that half
    was for the appellant and half for Mr.&nbsp;Heidari. His reasons, though not
    perfect, justified and explained the result and allowed for appellate review. We
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    failed to apply a credit of $149,027 against the damages awarded to Mr.
    Heidari.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no basis for this complaint. Mr.
    Heidari stated in his Reply to a Demand for Particulars that the credit had
    already been deducted from the amount he was claiming. Although the appellant
    amended his Statement of Defence and Counterclaim following receipt of the
    Reply to the Demand for Particulars, he never raised this issue. Understandably
    therefore, the trial judge did not apply any further credit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fourth, the appellant asserts that the trial
    judge misstated the test for an oppression action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We disagree. He commenced by addressing whether
    the appellant had status to claim oppression. The appellant had argued that his
    entitlement to relief from oppression was based on being a shareholder of TEI
    when Tarra Engineering and Structural Consultants Inc. was incorporated in 2006
    to carry on TEI’s business activities but the trial judge rejected that
    contention. Having done so, it was unnecessary to conduct any further analysis into
    entitlement to an oppression remedy and the applicable test.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fifth, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred in relying on the testimony of Mr. Zanganeh, TEI’s bookkeeper, to
    prove that the appellant had signed away his single share in 2006. The trial
    judge had found Mr. Zanganeh to be unreliable and biased against the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    contention that he had not relinquished his share in 2006 in part because he
    believed Mr. Heidari and disbelieved the appellant. His disbelief was based on
    an extensive examination of the appellant’s lack of credibility and also the
    evidence of Brian Lindblom, an expert document examiner who positively
    identified the appellant’s signature on the share transfer document. In
    addition, in 2009, when writing to the Canada Revenue Agency, the appellant
    stated that he remembered signing documents for the purpose of a TEI share
    transfer to Mr. Heidari in 2006. Moreover, as the trial judge found, there was
    no evidence that the appellant ever requested any shareholder meetings after
    October 2006. Even though the trial judge considered Mr.&nbsp;Zanganeh to be
    unreliable, it was open to the trial judge to accept his evidence that he was
    present when the appellant signed the share transfer in the face of the strong
    corroboration offered by all of the other evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, the appeals are dismissed
    with total costs of $40,000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable tax to be
    paid by the appellant to the respondents ($20,000 for each action).</span></p>
