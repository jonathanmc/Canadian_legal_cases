lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Shortly before committing suicide, a person wrote
    a suicide note which met the requirements for a holograph will. He had been
    drinking and using drugs the day before his death. The sole issue for the court
    below was whether the deceased had testamentary capacity when he wrote the
    suicide note. The court concluded that he did not.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On this appeal, the court must revisit: (1) how
    to determine testamentary capacity where there are suspicious circumstances surrounding
    the preparation of a will, and (2) the principles governing cost orders in
    estate litigation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The requirements for a holograph will are set
    out in s. 6 of the <em>Succession Law Reform Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.26 (the
    “<strong>SLRA</strong>”):</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b><span lang=EN-CA>6</span></b><span lang=EN-CA> A
    testator may make a valid will wholly by his or her own handwriting and
    signature, without formality, and without the presence, attestation or

  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk91257374"><span lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sadly, Joseph Philip Joy (“<strong>Mr. Joy</strong>”
    or the “<strong>deceased</strong>”) died by suicide early on the morning of July
    13, 2019. He spent the day before his death working on his boat, drinking
    alcohol, and smoking hash oil cigarettes. When the police arrived on the scene,
    they discovered a signed two-page note, wholly in Mr. Joy’s handwriting, in the
    pocket of his shorts (the “<strong>Suicide Note</strong>”).</span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the Suicide Note, Mr. Joy began by apologizing
    for killing himself and said, using profane language, that his wife, Joanne Joy
    (“<strong>Ms. Joy</strong>”), “drove me to this” and “I’m beyond my control
    because of her.” He then asked his business partner, Steve Ramsundarsingh –
    whom he had named his executor in a previous will made in 2016 (the “<strong>2016
    Will</strong>”) – to make sure that Ms. Joy did not “get anything”. That
    statement was followed by, “This is my declaration that anything in my will
    that has her name on it is VOID. Everything goes to my stepson Michael &amp; grandson
    Michael”.</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the second page of the Suicide Note, Mr. Joy asked
    Steve Ramsundarsingh to make sure that Ms. Joy was not at his funeral. He also
    said, “I want my ashes spread in the pond in front of my cabin”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Michael Ronald McGrath is Mr. Joy’s stepson and
    the appellant in this matter (the “<strong>Appellant</strong>”). He brought an application
    to have the Suicide Note declared Mr.&nbsp;Joy’s valid will and admitted to
    probate (the “<strong>Application</strong>”). Michael&nbsp;McGrath&nbsp;Jr. (“<strong>Michael
    Jr.</strong>”) is the Appellant’s son and the other named beneficiary under the
    Suicide Note. At the time of the Application, Michael Jr. was 7 years old. The
    Office of the Children’s Lawyer (the “<strong>OCL</strong>”) represented
    Michael&nbsp;Jr. on the Application. It wholly supported the Appellant’s
    position on the Application that the Suicide Note was Mr. Joy’s valid will and should
    be admitted to probate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appellant submitted the expert report of Dr.
    Mark Sinyor on the Application (the “<strong>Report</strong>”). Dr. Sinyor, a psychiatrist
    at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, is an expert in the field of suicidality.
    Dr. Sinyor was unable to make a definitive pronouncement on whether Mr. Joy was
    intoxicated by alcohol and/or cannabis when he wrote the Suicide Note or whether
    that potential intoxication might have made him incapable of making a will.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Application was opposed by Ms. Joy and
    Dexter Ramsundarsingh (“<strong>Mr.&nbsp;Ramsundarsingh</strong>”). Mr.
    Ramsundarsingh is Steve Ramsundarsingh’s son and a long-time friend of the deceased.
    I refer to Ms. Joy and Mr. Ramsundarsingh together as the “<strong>Respondents</strong>”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Respondents were named beneficiaries under the
    2016 Will, as were the Appellant and Michael Jr. However, in the Suicide Note,
    no mention was made of Mr. Ramsundarsingh and, as explained above, Ms. Joy was
    disinherited.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no dispute that the Suicide Note met the
    requirements for a valid will contained in s. 6 of the SLRA: the document was
    wholly in Mr. Joy’s own handwriting and he signed it. However, the Respondents contended
    that the Appellant had failed to prove that Mr. Joy had testamentary capacity
    to make a will when he wrote the Suicide Note. Mr. Ramsundarsingh also took the
    alternative position that, if the Suicide Note were found to be a valid will, it
    should be construed as a codicil to the 2016 Will.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on Mr. Joy’s consumption of alcohol and
    drugs the day before his death, the application judge concluded that Mr. Joy lacked
    testamentary capacity when he wrote the Suicide Note. By order dated December
    2, 2020 (the “<strong>Order</strong>”), he dismissed the Application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By further order dated December 2, 2020, the
    application judge made a blended costs order in which he ordered Mr. Joy’s
    estate (the “<strong>Estate</strong>”) to pay a small part of the costs of the
    Respondents and the OCL, and the Appellant to pay the majority of their costs (the
    “<strong>Costs Order</strong>”).</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On this appeal, the Appellant challenges the correctness
    of both the application judge’s conclusion that Mr. Joy lacked testamentary capacity
    and the Costs Order. In my view, the Appellant succeeds on both matters.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Consequently, for the reasons that follow, I
    would allow the appeal, declare the Suicide Note to be Mr. Joy’s valid will,
    and admit it to probate. I would also set aside the Costs Order, order the
    Estate to pay the Appellant’s full indemnity costs both below and in this court,
    and substitute new costs orders in respect of the Respondents and the OCL.</span></p>

    Ramsundarsingh is Mr.&nbsp;Ramsundarsingh’s father. Mr. Ramsundarsingh is in
    his thirties and a licenced electrician. He worked for Regional Electric and
    Services Inc. Mr. Ramsundarsingh and Mr. Joy were very close.</span></p>

    became distant at that time. However, this changed when the Appellant returned
    to work for the Businesses as an apprentice electrician in February 2019. By
    that time, the Appellant had his son, Michael Jr., whom Mr. Joy treated as his grandson.

    often fought about finances. Mr.&nbsp;Joy moved out and left Ms. Joy more than
    once during the marriage. During the separations, Mr. Joy often stayed with Mr.
    Ramsundarsingh. In March 2019, Mr. Joy moved out of the home he shared with Ms.

    the application judge noted that there was no dispute that the Suicide Note met
    the requirements in s. 6 of the SLRA. Thus,<i> </i>the only issue on the
    Application was whether Mr. Joy had testamentary capacity to make a will when
    he wrote the Suicide Note. He observed that holograph wills have long been
    accepted as a form of testamentary disposition and can be admitted to probate,
    provided capacity is not an issue. However, a suicide note is a special
    circumstance that requires close scrutiny. As the propounder of the Suicide
    Note, the Appellant bore the burden of proving testamentary capacity.</span></p>

    with the evidentiary burden when suspicious circumstances (including suicide) exist
    and how testamentary capacity is determined. On the matter of testamentary
    capacity, he referred to <em>Banks v. Goodfellow</em><i> </i>(1870), L.R. 5 Q.B.
    549 (U.K. Queen’s Bench Div.). He also quoted para. 14 of <em>Hall v. Bennett
    Estate</em><i> </i>(2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 191 (C.A.), in which Charron J.A.,
    speaking on behalf of this court, gave the following summary of the law on testamentary
    capacity. A testator must have a “sound disposing mind” to make a valid will.
    To have a sound disposing mind, the testator must: (1) understand the nature and
    effect of a will; (2) recollect the nature and extent of his or her property;
    (3) understand the extent of what he or she is giving under the will; (4) remember
    the persons that he or she might be expected to benefit under his or her will;
    and, (5) where applicable, understand the nature of the claims that may be made
    by persons he or she is excluding from the will.</span></p>

    testamentary capacity is a question of fact and, thus, the palpable and

    he made no attempt to apply them. Instead, after discussing the legal
    principles, the application judge simply stated his conclusion and listed a
    number of points he said assisted him in reaching it. None of those points relate
    to, or address, the governing legal principles. Rather, they are primarily
    directed at Mr. Joy’s use of drugs and alcohol generally and on the day before

    at para. 27. Moreover, because the application judge did not apply the relevant

    ever since. The application judge correctly stated those principles at several
    places in the Reasons. For example, at para. 49 of the Reasons, relying on
    para. 14 of <em>Hall v. Bennett Estate</em>, he states that to make a valid
    will, a testator must have a “sound disposing mind” and to have a sound

    understood the nature and effect of a will. On the record, he had never sought
    legal assistance in making a will. Nonetheless, he prepared the 2014 Will, the 2016
    Will, and the Suicide Note, the last of which meets the formal requirements for
    a valid will, being wholly in his own handwriting and bearing his signature. Thus,
    this element of the test requires a consideration of whether Mr. Joy understood
    the nature and effect of a will when he wrote the Suicide Note. In my view,
    there can be no doubt that he did.</span></p>

    thought he was writing his will. He implored Steve Ramsundarsingh – the person
    whom he had named as executor under his 2016 Will – to carry out his last
    wishes. He gave instructions about who was to attend his funeral and how his
    ashes were to be spread. And he used language commonly found in wills. He made his
    “declaration” that anything he left to Ms. Joy in a prior will was “void”. He
    then disposed of his assets stating that “Everything goes to my stepson Michael
    &amp; grandson Michael”.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is important to consider this element
    informed by an understanding of Mr.&nbsp;Joy’s financial position at the time
    of death. At that time, and for some period before it, Mr. Joy was in financial
    difficulties. He had few assets and, as is apparent from the claims by debtors after
    his death, he had substantial indebtedness. Indeed, on Ms. Joy’s evidence, the
    conflict between her and Mr. Joy was often related to Mr. Joy’s unfortunate financial
    situation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Suicide Note shows that Mr. Joy was aware of
    one of his few significant assets, namely, a $600,000 insurance policy. In his
    2016 Will, Mr. Joy bequeathed the after-tax proceeds of that policy to Ms. Joy.
    In the Suicide Note, he states that anything he gave to Ms. Joy in that will
    was “VOID”. He had to have recollected that asset when he wrote the Suicide
    Note in order for him to declare that his previous disposition of it was void.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Joy also recalled his beloved cabin in

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, Mr. Joy does not expressly address his interest
    in the Businesses in the Suicide Note. In my view, that omission does not necessarily
    indicate that Mr. Joy failed to recollect this part of his property. I say this
    for two reasons. First, it will be recalled that, in his 2016 Will, Mr. Joy
    bequeathed “my 50% shares” of the Businesses to Mr. Ramsundarsingh. After making
    the 2016 Will, Mr. Joy and Steve&nbsp;Ramsundarsingh re-organized the
    Businesses and gave Mr.&nbsp;Ramsundarsingh the common shares in them. What Mr.
    Joy meant by his “50% shares” in the Businesses is unclear. It may be that Mr.
    Joy believed that he had given Mr. Ramsundarsingh his 50% interest in the
    Businesses through his gift of the common shares to Mr. Ramsundarsingh. Second,
    and more importantly, in the Suicide Note, Mr. Joy disposed of all his assets
    when he stated, “Everything goes to my stepson Michael &amp; grandson Michael”.
    This wording shows a clear intention on the part of Mr. Joy to bequeath all his
    property, no matter the nature and extent of it, to the Appellant and Michael
    Jr.</span></p>

    and Mr. Ramsundarsingh are people that also might be expected to benefit under
    Mr. Joy’s will. In this regard, I note that Mr. Joy made bequests to each of
    them in his 2014 and 2016 Wills (as well as to the Appellant and Michael Jr.). However,
    the absence of a bequest to Ms. Joy in the Suicide Note does not mean that Mr.
    Joy failed to remember her. In fact, Mr. Joy did expressly remember her in the Suicide
    Note but chose to disinherit her. Although expressed in profane terms in the
    Suicide Note, there can be no mistaking his intention that Ms. Joy receive nothing
    from his Estate.</span></p>

    the common shares in the Businesses to Mr. Ramsundarsingh after he made the
    2016 Will, at the time of writing the Suicide Note, Mr. Joy may have believed he

    time of his death, she might have a claim against his Estate. However, Mr. Joy
    had no reason to be concerned about such a claim. Ms. Joy had purchased the
    matrimonial home in which the couple resided and made the mortgage payments on
    it. Ms. Joy was the more successful financially of the two. There is nothing to
    suggest that Mr. Joy did not understand that. Consequently, in my view, this

    testator must have a “sound disposing mind”. A testator has a sound disposing
    mind, if he or she: understands the nature and effect of a will; recollects the
    nature and extent of his or her property; understands the extent of what he or

    the basis of Mr. Joy’s use of drugs and alcohol, in general and on the day
    before he died. The application judge erred in principle by failing to apply
    the relevant legal principles. He also erred in the points he relied on for his

  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Joy’s regular use of drugs and alcohol, and

  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>b.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Sinyor’s evidence was inconclusive on Mr.
    Joy’s incapacity and he did not have the benefit of the cross-examination
    evidence about Mr. Joy’s history of substance abuse and actual consumption on

  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Suicide Note was sloppily written, laced
    with profanities directed at Ms. Joy, and contained a statement in it which
    said that he was “beyond my control” because of Ms. Joy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I will deal with each group in turn.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Joy’s Substance Use</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is an error to infer a lack of testamentary
    capacity based on a person’s use of alcohol and drugs. If a testator suffers
    from a disorder or condition that may impact on his or her testamentary capacity,
    that matter should be considered when applying the relevant legal principles for
    determining testamentary capacity. This can be seen in <em>Banks</em>, the English
    case which served as the foundation for the Canadian law on testamentary
    capacity.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Banks</em>, the testator suffered from
    paranoid delusions. He had been institutionalized for them but was discharged
    before he made his will. When deciding whether he had testamentary capacity, the
    court said, at p. 565, that it was essential that the testator should
    understand the nature of the act and its effect, the extent of the property of
    which he was disposing, and the claims to which he ought to give effect. In
    respect of the last element, the court said that “no disorder of the mind shall
    poison his affections … or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties – that
    no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property”. That
    is, the court applied the elements for determining testamentary capacity, with
    due consideration of the testator’s medical condition. The court concluded that
    the testator’s medical condition did not preclude a finding of testamentary
    capacity because the testator could “discern” and “judge” the elements comprising
    the legal test: at p. 567.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, in cases where testamentary capacity is
    questioned due to a testator’s alcoholism or significant alcohol use, capacity
    is determined by the application of the relevant legal principles. This can be
    seen in <em>Dujardin v. Dujardin</em>, 2018 ONCA 597, 423 D.L.R. (4th) 731.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Dujardin</em>, the testator’s wife
    challenged his wills on the basis that he suffered from chronic alcoholism and
    therefore lacked testamentary capacity. The trial judge applied the relevant legal
    principles, found that the testator had testamentary capacity, and admitted the
    wills to probate. Trotter J. A., writing for this court, upheld the trial
    decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Neither level of court in <em>Dujardin</em><i> </i>ignored
    the evidence surrounding the testator’s alcohol use. On a typical workday, the
    testator had a few drinks after work and then drank alcohol at home until he
    fell asleep. He purchased around 40 ounces of liquor each day. Nor did the
    courts ignore medical evidence relating to his alcohol use. After
    hospitalization for a heart attack, the testator had been released with a discharge
    summary that referred to the possibility of “organic brain syndrome secondary
    to alcohol abuse.” This evidence, however, did not resolve the question of
    capacity at the time the testator made his wills. A determination of that
    matter was made by applying the relevant legal principles. When the elements
    making up the legal test for testamentary capacity were applied, the trial
    judge found the testator had testamentary capacity. Trotter J.A., for this
    court, soundly upheld that decision and the trial judge’s reasons for it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is noteworthy that neither level of court in <em>Dujardin</em> began from the premise that a pattern of very heavy drinking, on a daily basis,
    suggested testamentary incapacity. Instead, Trotter J.A. approved of the trial
    judge’s approach, which was to decide testamentary capacity based on a consideration
    of the evidence relevant to each element of the test – including the evidence
    of the testator’s alcohol abuse and possible organic brain damage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the present case, there is no evidence that
    Mr. Joy had a disorder or condition that could support a finding of lack of testamentary
    capacity. He had never been diagnosed, treated, or hospitalized for alcoholism,
    a substance disorder, or other mental health challenge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, despite apparently daily and increasing
    use of alcohol and drugs, Mr. Joy continued to function at work. Mr. Joy’s
    consumption of drugs and alcohol the day before he died does not detract from a
    finding of testamentary capacity made on the proper application of the relevant
    legal principles.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    all testified that Mr. Joy was drunk the day before he died, none said that he
    presented as irrational, delusional, incoherent, or abnormal. Mr.
    Ramsundarsingh said that in his 10-15 minute telephone call with Mr. Joy at
    around 6:30 p.m. the night before Mr. Joy died, he and Mr. Joy spoke about a
    job they had been pricing for weeks. Mr. Joy told Mr. Ramsundarsingh that they did
    not get the job and he was not happy about that. They also discussed a trip up
    north to look for work. While Mr.&nbsp;Ramsundarsingh said Mr. Joy sounded
    bothered by not getting the job, he also confirmed that Mr. Joy was coherent,
    making sense, comprehensive, and responsive during the call. And, in the FaceTime
    call that Arlene had with Mr. Joy later that evening at around 11 p.m., Arlene
    said he was drunk because he was holding a drink and acting silly, but she did
    not say he was incoherent or not making sense.</span></p>

    dismissive of Dr. Sinyor’s evidence. He is a psychiatrist with expertise in the
    field of suicidality. To the best of his knowledge, at the time he prepared the
    Report, Dr. Sinyor was the only scientist to have led and conducted a study of
    a large sample of suicide notes with the explicit purpose of identifying how
    often, and in what form, holograph will content was present.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is unsurprising that Dr. Sinyor was unable to
    provide a definitive opinion on whether Mr. Joy was intoxicated when he wrote
    the Suicide Note and, if he was, whether he was so intoxicated that the Suicide
    Note was “the product of a transient, impaired state of mind produced by that intoxication
    which did not reflect his true beliefs and wishes.” There was no toxicology
    screen performed on Mr. Joy’s body and there was no clinical evidence of incapacity.
    Importantly, however, while the Report was prepared for the Application and,
    consequently, Dr. Sinyor did not have the benefit of the cross-examination
    evidence when he wrote it, he had been made fully aware of Mr. Joy’s alcohol
    and substance use before he wrote the Report.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    challenges. Many people also use and abuse alcohol and drugs. Dr. Sinyor’s
    expert evidence assists in understanding how different capacity issues may
    arise when people have drugs and/or alcohol in their system. Importantly, the Report
    confirms that none of suicide, alcoholism, or other substance abuse disorders,
    together or in combination, are sufficient to infer lack of testamentary capacity.</span></p>

    police could read the Suicide Note and so could I, which suggests it was not
    illegible. Mr. Joy often used profanities in his speech, texts, and other written
    communications. The profanities he directed at Ms. Joy indicate that Mr. Joy
    was angry and upset with her – so, too, is his statement that she had caused him
    to lose control and take his life. But, these matters are not indicators that Mr.
    Joy lacked testamentary capacity.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Joy had testamentary capacity because he had
    a “sound disposing mind” when he wrote the Suicide Note. He had a sound
    disposing mind because he understood the nature and effect of a will;
    recollected the nature and extent of his property; understood the extent of
    what he was giving under the will; remembered the people that might be expected
    to benefit under his will; and, understood the nature of the claims that might
    be brought by Ms. Joy, a person excluded from the will.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The burden of proof was on the Appellant, as the
    propounder of the Suicide Note, to show Mr. Joy had testamentary capacity when
    he wrote it. In my view, he discharged that burden.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Because I have determined that the Suicide Note
    is Mr. Joy’s valid will, I must address Mr. Ramsundarsingh’s alternative submission
    that the Suicide Note is “more correctly characterized” as a codicil to the
    2016 Will. Counsel for Mr.&nbsp;Ramsundarsingh candidly acknowledged that he
    has no legal authority to support this submission. On this submission, Mr.
    Joy’s “50% shares in” the Businesses would pass to Mr. Ramsundarsingh by virtue
    of the 2016 Will.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I reject this submission for two reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, it flies in the face of the wording of s.
    6 of the SLRA. Section 6 provides that a testator “may make a valid <u>will</u> wholly by his or her handwriting and signature” (emphasis added). Although a
    will and a codicil are both testamentary documents, they are not the same
    thing. Section 6 is unambiguous: it empowers a testator to make a valid will. Having
    found that Mr. Joy had the requisite testamentary capacity, because the Suicide
    Note meets the s. 6 requirements, it is Mr. Joy’s valid will. It is not a
    codicil.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, to accede to this submission would result
    in the maladministration of Mr. Joy’s valid will (i.e., the Suicide Note). One
    term of the Suicide Note is that “everything” is to go to the Appellant and
    Michael Jr. To give effect to any bequest made in a prior will would be
    contrary to that term and, therefore, an act of maladministration. Clearly,
    this court cannot countenance an outcome that would lead to the
    maladministration of Mr. Joy’s valid will.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge referred to the governing
    principles on costs orders in estate litigation as set out in <em>Neuberger
    Estate</em>. However, he failed to follow those principles with the result that
    the Costs Order is plainly wrong and must be set aside: <em>Hamilton v. Open
    Window Bakery Ltd.</em>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303, at para. 27.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Traditionally in estate litigation, the parties’
    costs were paid from the testator’s estate. In <em>McDougald Estate v.
    Gooderham</em><i> </i>(2005), 255 D.L.R. (4th) 435 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 78-79,
    this court explained the public policy considerations that underlay the
    traditional approach: the need to give effect to valid wills that reflect the
    intention of competent testators and the need to ensure that estates are
    properly administered. Accordingly, if there are reasonable grounds on which to
    question the execution of a will or the testator’s capacity to make the will,
    it is in the public interest that such questions be resolved without cost to
    those questioning the will’s validity. And, where the difficulties or
    ambiguities that gave rise to the litigation are caused by the testator, it is again
    appropriate for the testator’s estate to bear the costs of their resolution.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Over time, it became apparent that the courts
    had to guard against allowing their processes to be used to unnecessarily
    deplete a testator’s estate and a modern approach emerged. At para. 80 of <em>McDougald
    Estate</em>, this court summarized the modern approach that courts of first
    instance are to take in fixing costs in estate litigation:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[C]arefully scrutinize the litigation and, <u>unless
    the court finds that one or more of the public policy considerations set out
    above applies</u>, to follow the costs rules that apply in civil litigation. [Emphasis

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This approach was reiterated in <em>Sawdon Estate
    v. Sawdon</em>, 2014 ONCA 101, 119 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 84, and in <em>Neuberger
    Estate</em>,<i> </i>at para. 24.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jurisprudence is clear: at first instance, when
    deciding costs in estate litigation, the court must begin by carefully
    scrutinizing the litigation to determine whether one or more of the public
    policy considerations applies. If so, as a general principle, the parties’
    reasonable costs are to be paid from the testator’s estate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is worthy of note that this approach is not a
    balancing of the public policy considerations against the rationale for cost
    rules that ordinarily apply to civil litigation. Rather, it is a sequential
    analysis, the first step of which is to determine whether one or more of the
    public policy considerations apply. If so, generally the parties’ reasonable
    costs should be payable from the estate. A departure from this general
    principle requires justification on the part of the court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge failed to take the necessary
    first step. Instead of determining whether one or more of the public policy
    considerations underlay the Application, he began from the premise that the civil
    litigation costs regime operated. Consequently, he ordered the Appellant – as
    the losing party – to pay the bulk of the other parties’ costs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Had the Application Judge taken that first step,
    he would have found that the public policy considerations applied and the Application
    was necessary to ensure that Mr. Joy’s estate was properly administered. Mr.
    Joy wrote the Suicide Note in suspicious circumstances. Those circumstances
    created reasonable grounds on which to question Mr. Joy’s testamentary capacity
    at the time he wrote the Suicide Note. Moreover, it was Mr. Joy’s conduct that
    led to the litigation – because of the circumstances in which he wrote the
    Suicide Note, it was unclear whether his Estate should be administered
    according to the Suicide Note or his 2016 Will.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the general principle governing costs
    awards in estate litigation applied and the Estate should bear the parties’
    reasonable costs of the Application. I see no justification for departing from the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To the extent that the application judge’s reasons
    can be read as a possible explanation for departing from the general principle,
    in my view, he erred. He said that the Appellant had acted unreasonably in
    bringing the Application and was “pursuing his self-interest in an attempt to oust
    the legacies to [the Respondents]”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Appellant did not act unreasonably in bringing the Application.
    Because of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the making of the Suicide
    Note, Mr.&nbsp;Joy’s testamentary capacity was called into question. This meant
    that it was unclear whether the Estate should be administered in accordance
    with its terms or those of the 2016 Will. While generally the executor should
    take the necessary steps to ensure that the estate is properly administered,
    Steve Ramsundarsingh renounced his right to administer Mr. Joy’s estate,
    clearly indicating that he would not bring the Application. The Appellant brought
    the Application to ensure that Mr.&nbsp;Joy’s estate was distributed in
    accordance with his true testamentary wishes, whether that was found to be as
    expressed in the Suicide Note or the 2016 Will. In these circumstances, it
    cannot be said that the Appellant acted unreasonably in bringing the
    Application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Nor was the application judge correct in saying that, in bringing
    the Application, the Appellant was pursuing his self-interest. Apart entirely
    from the public policy considerations which, as I explain above, required the bringing
    of the Application, the Appellant’s position on the application was also of
    benefit to his minor son, Michael Jr., a position which the OCL fully
    supported.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I also query the correctness of the Costs Order in respect of the OCL.
    Because the application judge gave no reasons for that matter, it is not clear
    why he made it or why he treated the OCL differently from the Appellant on the
    matter of costs. The OCL wholly supported the Appellant on the Application. Therefore,
    on the application judge’s reasoning, both the OCL and the Appellant were the
    “losing” parties. There is no apparent reason for their divergent treatment by
    the application judge on the matter of costs. However, as I have concluded that
    the OCL – like the other parties – is entitled to its costs of the Application,
    payable from the Estate, I need not resolve this matter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>On this appeal, no party raised an issue in respect to the quantum
    of costs awarded to the OCL and the Respondents. Thus, I would use the amounts
    as determined by the application judge but make them payable from the Estate.
    Having reviewed the Appellant’s bill of costs (as well as those of the other
    parties), I am satisfied that the steps taken were warranted and the amounts
    claimed are reasonable. Accordingly, in my view, the Estate should pay the Appellant’s
    costs of the Application, on a full indemnity basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk95147009"><span lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I turn now to the question of costs of this appeal.
    At paras. 86-91 of <em>McDougald Estate</em>, after considering the limited
    jurisprudence on the principles that govern costs awards in estate litigation
    at the appellate level, this court concluded that costs are normally ordered
    against an unsuccessful appellant. Further, the same rules that govern costs in
    civil litigation at the appeal level apply to unsuccessful appellants in estate
    litigation: absent exceptional circumstances, the unsuccessful appellant is not
    entitled to costs of the appeal and will be ordered to pay the respondent(s)
    costs on a partial indemnity basis: <em>McDougald Estate</em>, at paras. 77, 91.
    However, where an appellant in estate litigation is successful, the appellant’s
    costs are generally payable from the estate on a full indemnity basis: <em>McDougald
    Estate</em>, at paras. 87-88.</span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, because the Appellant is the wholly successful party, in
    my view, he is entitled to full indemnity costs from the Estate, provided those
    costs are reasonable and warranted. I note that a blended costs award is
    available where an appellant succeeds in an estate matter. The rationale for
    this can be found at paras. 93-107 of <em>Sawdon Estate</em><i>.</i> Although
    the Respondents were unsuccessful on appeal, I do not see this as a situation
    in which they should be required to pay the Appellant’s costs on a partial
    indemnity basis. Their participation at first instance was necessary to ensure
    that the questions surrounding Mr. Joy’s testamentary capacity were fully
    explored. Their views prevailed at first instance. The public policy
    considerations that applied below continue to operate at this level of court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Consequently, in my view, the Respondents are entitled to their
    reasonable costs of the appeal from the Estate. Because it was Mr. Joy’s conduct
    that created the need for this litigation, in my view, it would be unfair to penalize
    the Respondents in costs below or on appeal. At the oral hearing of the appeal,
    the Respondents each sought $10,000 in costs. I would order those costs and
    make them payable from the Estate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I would make no order of costs of the appeal in favour of the OCL
    for two reasons. First, the OCL gave no reason for changing its position on
    appeal from that which it took on the Application. While the OCL supported the
    Appellant on the Application, on appeal it supported Ms. Joy in opposition to
    the Appellant. Second, the OCL had very limited involvement on the appeal. It
    adopted Ms. Joy’s submissions in its factum, relied on the documentation that
    she filed, and made no oral submissions.</span></p>
