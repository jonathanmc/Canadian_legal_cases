    assaulting X.F. The trial was short. There were three witnesses. There was one
    main issue in dispute. X.F. said she did not consent to sexual intercourse with
    the appellant. He testified she did.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>X.F. and the appellant had met at a car rally.
    X.F. modelled at those rallies. She placed an ad on Instagram, looking for a
    location for a photoshoot. The appellant offered his house. X.F. agreed to meet
    him at the house. The appellant picked her up and they drove to a local Walmart
    to buy some drinks. From there, they proceeded to the home.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and X.F. both testified they had
    sexual intercourse at the appellant’s home. According to him, it was consensual
    and was the culmination of a series of consensual sexual contacts that began
    when he and X.F. were walking around Walmart. According to the appellant, he
    had his arm around X.F.’s waist and, on one occasion, touched her buttocks.
    X.F. acknowledged that this occurred. Although it made her feel somewhat
    uncomfortable, she did not say anything or move away from the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>X.F. testified the appellant made sexual
    advances after they arrived at his house. At one point, she told him she was
    fine with kisses, but nothing else was going to happen. The appellant persisted
    in his advances. After about 40 minutes, X.F., who was becoming upset, told the
    appellant she had no interest in having sex with anyone and nothing was going
    to happen. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the appellant, he told X.F. that he
    wanted to make love with her and she said, “that’s fine” but that she would not
    see him again. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>X.F. testified that she eventually made her way
    out of the bedroom to the bathroom. The appellant followed. He picked X.F. up
    and placed her on the countertop. A couple of minutes later, he carried her to
    the bed. The appellant did not ask permission to do any of these things. X.F.
    did not tell him he could not do any of these things.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>X.F. testified, that when the appellant put her
    on the bed, she told him her pants were not coming off. She also told him that
    if he attempted to have sex with her, she would never speak to him again. She
    told the appellant she did not want to “have sex or bang”. She was crying. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant proceeded to insert his penis into
    X.F.’s vagina. A short time later, he stopped and said he was sorry.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the appellant, X.F. never said she
    did not want to have sex. To the contrary, when he told her he wanted to make
    love to her, she nodded and said, “that’s fine”. She was not crying and she did
    not raise any objection to his actions. She told him everything was “okay”
    while they were having sex. He stopped when it seemed to him that they were not
    connecting emotionally.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Immediately after the sexual intercourse, X.F.
    asked the appellant to take her home. She testified the appellant admitted he
    should not have had sex with her. Later that night, the appellant and X.F.
    exchanged text messages. He apologized, indicating that when he held her, “it
    just felt right”. X.F. told him he had to get better control of himself. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The day after the alleged rape, X.F. spoke with
    her foster mother and told her she had been raped. Her foster mother took her
    to the hospital. X.F. was seen by Social Services and the police took a
    statement later that day. According to X.F.’s foster mother, X.F. was very
    upset when she spoke to her foster mother. In fact, her foster mother testified
    she had never seen X.F. so upset.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge reviewed the evidence of the
    complainant and the appellant at some length. The central findings by the trial
    judge are set out below (at para. 39): </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In the end, on the critical parts of his
    testimony, I do not accept as true what the defendant said about X.F.’s
    purported consent to have intercourse that night. Instead, I find as a fact
    that X.F. specifically told the defendant that her pants were to stay on and
    she did not want to “bang” or “have sex”. Despite her clear words, the
    defendant chose to disregard her wishes and took advantage of her physically
    because she was smaller, younger, and did not protest when he pursued his
    desires: (para. 31). There was no “vibe” that X.F. exuded to permit the
    defendant to engage in intercourse with her. I accept the defendant’s evidence
    that his statement “I want to make love” was said. X.F. did not deny this.
    However, she never agreed to this, she never said it was “fine” for him to act
    on his wishes and she did not give consent, nor say or do anything from which
    consent could reasonably be inferred. To the contrary, I find the complainant
    was clear that she was not interested in having sexual intercourse with the
    defendant and he simply chose to disregard her stated intentions. </span></p>

    is to the trial judge’s credibility findings, appellate courts have repeatedly
    acknowledged the advantaged position of trial judges and approached arguments
    about credibility errors with strong deference to the trial judge’s findings: <em>G.F.</em>,
    at paras. 81-82. As observed in <em>G.F.</em>, credibility assessments are not to
    be overturned simply because a surgical parsing by the appellate court of the
    trial judge’s reasons reveals “an imperfect or summary expression on the part
    of the trial judge”: <em>G.F.</em>, at para. 76. </span></p>

    elements of the complainant’s demeanour in his assessment of her credibility.
    Read as a whole, however, we cannot say those references demonstrate that the
    trial judge’s reliance on demeanour was “undue”. The trial judge addressed
    several other factors that were also relevant to credibility. He noted:</span></p>

    upset the following morning was confirmatory of her version of events.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the appellant submits that the
    finding that X.F.’s evidence was “balanced” was no more than a finding that she
    did not exaggerate her evidence, or make allegations that were worse than the
    ones she did make. We read the finding that the evidence was “balanced” as a
    finding that X.F. told her story frankly and in a manner which did not suggest she
    was shaping her evidence to put herself in the best light, or the appellant in
    the worst light. X.F. acknowledged facts that were not helpful to her, and
    offered some support for the appellant’s position. A finding properly rooted in
    the evidence that there are strong <em>indicia</em> of candour and
    forthrightness in a witness’s testimony, are positive features of that
    witness’s evidence, capable of supporting a finding that the witness’s evidence
    is credible.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We accept that the mere absence of deliberate
    exaggeration by a witness does not make the witness more credible. In our view,
    however, the trial judge’s description of X.F. as giving “balanced” evidence
    went well beyond a mere finding that she did not deliberately exaggerate her
    evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel’s argument that the trial judge failed
    to deal with inconsistencies between the complainant’s evidence and her
    statement to the police is not borne out by the record. There was one
    inconsistency identified by counsel. X.F. used different language in her
    statement and in her testimony when describing her reaction to the appellant’s
    advances at Walmart. To the extent that the two versions are inconsistent, the
    failure by the trial judge to expressly deal with this one inconsistency in no
    way undermines the overall force of the reasons. This kind of microscopic
    review of a trial judge’s credibility assessments is exactly what the Supreme
    Court has cautioned against in several cases, including <em>G.F.</em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Demeanour certainly factored into the trial
    judge’s assessment of credibility. No one suggests that it should not have. The
    appellant has not satisfied us that the trial judge’s consideration of
    demeanour was “undue”.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #2: Did the trial judge take an overly
    narrow view of how consent can be communicated?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge clearly and unequivocally accepted
    the evidence of X.F. that she told the appellant more than once that she did
    not want to have sex with him and was not consenting to sexual intercourse. The
    trial judge equally clearly and unequivocally rejected the appellant’s evidence
    that X.F. had communicated her consent to have sex with him by telling him
    “that’s fine” when he asked if he could make love to her. Therefore, the
    verdict in no way turned on how consent could or could not be communicated. On
    the findings, there was no consent to sexual intercourse of any kind
    communicated by X.F.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant nonetheless argues that, in
    rejecting the appellant’s testimony, the trial judge erred by relying upon an
    overly narrow view of how consent can be communicated. Specifically, based on
    the appellant’s acknowledgements that he had repeatedly touched the complainant
    in sexually suggestive ways throughout the evening without asking permission,
    the trial judge said, “one of the main problems I have with the defendant’s
    testimony is that the defendant made assumptions about the level of physical
    contact X.F. wanted with him and mistook her silence or acquiescence as
    consent”. It is clear from the decision, as a whole, that the trial judge
    reasoned that the appellant’s testimony about the communication that occurred
    relating specifically to sexual intercourse was implausible, given his pattern
    of behaviour relating to consent throughout the evening. We see no error in
    this reasoning. It does not reveal an overly narrow view of how consent can be
    communicated but instead, constitutes a pattern of conduct that the trial judge
    was entitled to rely upon.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #3: Did the trial judge reverse the
    burden of proof on the question of mistaken belief in consent?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge began his reasons with a full
    and accurate description of the Crown’s burden of proof. Near the end of his
    reasons, after finding that X.F. did not consent, the trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I have considered whether on all of the
    evidence it is established that the defendant could have reasonably held an
    honest but mistaken belief in consent. In light of the factual findings I have
    come to, this defence also fails.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the above-quoted
    passage wrongly puts the onus on the appellant to “establish” a reasonable but
    mistaken belief in consent. There is some merit to the appellant’s submission,
    if the above-quoted passage is considered in isolation from the trial judge’s
    earlier, more detailed description of the burden of proof.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In any event, on the trial judge’s findings of
    fact, all of which stand given our rejection of the first ground of appeal,
    there was no air of reality to a claim of an honest and reasonably held belief
    in consent. On the trial judge’s findings, there was sexual intercourse in the
    face of repeated refusals by X.F. to consent to sexual intercourse.</span></p>
