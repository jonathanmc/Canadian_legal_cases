  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice Erika Chozik of the Ontario
    Superior Court of Justice, dated October 9, 2020.</p>
  <p><strong>Tulloch J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties were married for 18 years and separated in 2010. During
    their marriage, they had three children: Tyas, Garett, and Corinne. Following
    their 2010&nbsp;separation, they litigated until May 12, 2015, at which time
    they entered into a consent final order (“the Mossip Order”) that incorporated
    terms set out in minutes of settlement. The Mossip Order provided for child
    support and spousal support. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In August 2018, the respondent began new employment in Qatar and his
    income increased significantly from approximately $78,000 to approximately $214,000.
    Following the respondent’s post-separation increase in income, the appellant
    brought a motion to vary child support and spousal support, among other relief.
    The motion was dismissed in its entirety. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant now appeals. She argues that the motion judge made several
    errors in her application of the law and apprehension of the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, the appeal is allowed in part.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

  <p class=MsoListBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

    support.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

  <p class=MsoListBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent would make a one-time payment of $4,000 for retroactive s. 7
    expenses. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent would contribute to s. 7 expenses in the amount of $33&nbsp;per
    child per month. </p>

  <p class=Heading>Decision Below</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In August 2018, the appellant filed a motion to change the Mossip Order,
    seeking: 1) the enforcement of amounts she claimed remained outstanding; 2)&nbsp;variation
    of spousal support; 3) variation of the child support termination date for both
    the older and middle children; 4) an order for payment of future s. 7 expenses
    for both the middle and youngest child; and Table amount child support
    commencing September 1, 2020 for the middle and youngest child.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge refused to grant any of the relief sought.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the motion judge found that the amounts the appellant claimed
    were outstanding were satisfied. The respondent had paid the appellant $18,435
    in net proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial home, paid the appellant’s
    share of a joint line of credit in the amount of $2,520.60 and transferred
    $22,825.60 to the appellant from his RRSP. She determined that this was more
    than sufficient to cover the outstanding amounts, and that the appellant had
    previously confirmed with the FRO that all arrears were satisfied. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge refused to vary the spousal support. Because the Mossip
    Order incorporated minutes of settlement, she held that the appellant’s
    entitlement to spousal support was solely contractual in nature. Neither the
    Mossip Order nor the minutes of settlement contained terms that would permit a
    variation of support, and there was no finding that the appellant was entitled
    to compensatory or needs-based support. The motion judge further determined
    that the respondent’s increase in income was not a material change in
    circumstances because, on the appellant’s own affidavit evidence, it was in
    line with their expectations when the respondent began his MSW. Additionally,
    the increase in income was attributable to an intervening cause: the
    reorganization of his employment arrangements, his new marriage, and his lifestyle
    changes, including his move to Qatar. The appellant was therefore not entitled
    to share in the post-separation increase. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also refused to vary the termination date of child
    support for the oldest child or the middle child. Child support for both
    children was terminated on consent, and there was no evidence that either child
    remained a child of the marriage beyond the termination dates. Moreover, the
    motion judge determined that the respondent overpaid child support because the
    FRO could not confirm with the appellant whether an adjustment of child support
    was needed. Because the appellant failed to communicate promptly with the FRO,
    the respondent had continued to pay child support for three children until
    March 2018. The appellant also continued to collect child support while the
    middle child was no longer living with her. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the request that the respondent pay s. 7 expenses as of
    September 1, 2020, the motion judge noted that the Mossip Order also provides
    for these expenses to be shared between the parties, but that the appellant
    must provide an accounting of these expenses and has never done so. There was
    no reason to change the Mossip Order in this regard. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the motion judge declined to order Table amount child support
    for the middle child or the youngest child. The motion judge reviewed the
    jurisprudence on determining child support for a child of majority age who is
    attending post-secondary school. Due to a lack of evidence regarding the
    children’s financial circumstances and the appellant’s means and needs, the
    motion judge declined to order Table amount child support. The motion judge
    again noted that the Mossip Order already provides for sharing of s. 7
    expenses. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Issues</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the motion judge erred in several respects, both
    in determining the child support issues and the spousal support issues.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues with respect to child support are the following: </p>

    marriage?</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the motion
    judge err by finding that the appellant’s spousal support entitlement was contractual,

  <p class=Heading>Standard of Review</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset, it is important to note that the decision of a motion
    judge is owed a very high degree of deference. I am guided by the instructions
    of the Supreme Court in <em>Hickey v. Hickey</em>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518, at
    paras. 11-12: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Our Court has often emphasized the rule that appeal courts
    should not overturn support orders unless the reasons disclose an error in
    principle, a significant misapprehension of the evidence, or unless the award
    is clearly wrong. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>There are strong reasons for the significant deference that
    must be given to trial judges in relation to support orders. This standard of
    appellate review recognizes that the discretion involved in making a support
    order is best exercised by the judge who has heard the parties directly. It
    avoids giving parties an incentive to appeal judgments and incur added expenses
    in the hope that the appeal court will have a different appreciation of the
    relevant factors and evidence. This approach promotes finality in family law
    litigation and recognizes the importance of the appreciation of the facts by
    the trial judge. <span class=Underline>Though an appeal court must intervene
    when there is a material error, a serious misapprehension of the evidence, or
    an error in law, it is not entitled to overturn a support order simply because
    it would have made a different decision or balanced the factors differently</span>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, however, I am satisfied that the motion judge significantly
    misapprehended the evidence of child support overpayments, which in turn
    affected her analysis on whether arrears were owing. I am also satisfied that
    the motion judge erred in law in her analysis of the appellant’s spousal
    support entitlement and whether there was a material change in circumstances. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Child Support Issues </h3>
  <h6><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Did the Motion Judge Err in Finding the Respondent Overpaid Child
    Support?</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge made findings that there was an overpayment in child
    support in the amount of $36,000: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>…[O]n the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Applicant
    overpaid child support significantly. The Applicant puts the amount of his
    overpayment at $36,000. This amount is not disputed by the Respondent. The
    overpayment resulted in part from the Respondent’s delay of more than 20 months
    in confirming to FRO that the RRSP transfer had been made.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I also find that the Applicant overpaid child support. In
    February, 2018 the Applicant asked FRO to adjust the child support to be for
    one child. FRO attempted to confirm with the Respondent that an adjustment of
    child support was needed because Tyas had graduated from high school almost two
    years earlier and Garrett was no longer living with her. The Respondent failed
    to respond promptly to FRO. This resulted in a significant overpayment by the
    Applicant of child support. The Respondent continued to collect child support
    for three children until March, 2018 – well after Tyas had graduated from high
    school. She did not pay any child support for Garrett for a year knowing that
    she should be because he was not living with her. She continued to collect
    child support for Garrett until May 2018, even though he moved to live with the
    Applicant in February&nbsp;2018. There was an overpayment of child support as a
    result.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant mother argues the motion judge erred in finding that the
    respondent father overpaid $36,000 in child support. The appellant argues the
    motion judge misapprehended the FRO statement of account which showed a $36,000
    credit applied on March 19, 2018. The appellant contends that the subsequent
    adjustments on March 19 and 20, 2018, resulted in no overpayment of support.
    The amounts credited to the respondent by the FRO were for amounts owing to the
    appellant in accordance with the Mossip Order. The appellant further argues
    that the respondent admitted that any perceived overpayment was “dealt with
    through FRO”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent disputes that the motion judge erred and states that the he
    did in fact overpay. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the appellant that the motion judge misapprehended the
    evidence in finding an overpayment of $36,000. The statement of accounts from
    the FRO shows that beginning November 1, 2015, monthly payments were made to
    the FRO in the amount of $1,755, which total comprises child support for the
    three children, spousal support, and monthly s. 7 expenses as ordered in the
    Mossip Order. These payments continue until March 1, 2018. As noted above,
    March 2018 was when the parties confirmed with the FRO that support for the
    oldest child should have ended in July 2016 when he graduated high school, and
    that support for the other two children should have changed in February 2018
    when the middle child moved in with the respondent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On my calculation based on the statement of accounts, the respondent
    paid a total of $36,855 between July 2016 and March 2018, which is equivalent
    to $1,755 per month. However, the monthly rate of $1,755 was based on child
    support and s. 7 expenses for three children. When child support ended for the
    eldest in June 2016, the monthly payments should have changed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The credits applied by the FRO reflect that these monthly payments were
    incorrect. Between July 2016 and January 2018, the respondent should have only
    been paying child support for two children. Between February 2018, when Garett
    moved in with the respondent father, and May 2018, when support for Garett
    ended, the respondent father should have been paying child support for only the
    youngest child. The monthly payments for these obligations would almost
    certainly have been less than $1,755 per month. Therefore, it is true that there
    was an overpayment; however, the motion judge misperceived its quantum. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The $36,855 the respondent paid between July 2016 and March 2018 was not
    over and above what he was required to pay; only a portion of the $36,855 was
    an overpayment, because the respondent was still obligated to pay child support
    for his two other children and pay spousal support. Based on a review of the
    statement of accounts, from July 2016 to January 2018, the period of time when
    support was owing for the appellant and for two children, the respondent should
    have paid $1,396 per month. From February 2018 to May 2018, when support was
    owing for the appellant and only one child (because the middle child began
    residing with the respondent in February 2018 and then his child support
    entitlement terminated in May 2018), the respondent should have paid $896 per
    month. In total, this amounts to $29,595 the appellant should have actually
    paid, leaving an overpayment of $7,260. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last adjustment made by the FRO is in May 2018, when support for the
    middle child would have ended. From then on, the statement of accounts shows
    regular debits for $896, presumably the support cost for one child and for
    spousal support. The monthly payments are taken from the $7,260 credit
    remaining on the account; this credit runs out by the end of January 2019.
    Therefore, beginning in February 2019, the respondent should have resumed
    making payments for child support for the youngest child and for spousal
    support. He did not: the parties agree that payments did not resume until
    February 2020. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This misapprehension of the statement of accounts affected the motion
    judge’s analysis on whether child support arrears were owing, which I address
    next. </p>
  <h6><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Did the motion judge err by failing to consider whether child
    support arrears were owing for the youngest?</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge did not address the issue of child support for the
    period between March 2018 and February 2020. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the youngest child was entitled to child
    support between March 2018 and January 2020, but that the respondent did not
    make any such payments. The respondent takes a somewhat internally inconsistent
    position: he acknowledges that the overpayment credit was exhausted by 2019 but
    also argues that the $36,000 overpayment covered March 2018 to February 2020,
    and therefore it was not the case that the respondent did not make payments
    during this period. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last payment made by the respondent was in March 2018. Between April
    2018 and January 2020, the youngest child was still a minor residing at home with
    the appellant and attending high school. There is no evidence that any payments
    were received for this time period, aside from the credits applied from the
    overpayment which were exhausted by the end of January 2019, as described above. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties agree that the respondent recommenced making payments in the
    amount of $2,200 in February 2020. This amount roughly corresponds to monthly
    Table support for one child and the $150 per month required by the Mossip
    Order. This leaves a period of 12 months during which the respondent did not
    pay spousal or child support for the youngest child, then in high school and
    living with the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would fix the arrears of child and spousal support owed for this
    period at $26,400.</p>
  <h6><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Did the motion judge err by incorrectly applying the <em>Child
    Support Guidelines</em> to the youngest and to the middle child?</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the motion, the appellant sought $4,000 per month in Table support,
    since both the middle and youngest children would be residing with her while
    they attended full-time post-secondary studies beginning in September 2020. The
    respondent argued that while the children should be supported, the evidence
    demonstrated that their expenses would be covered by grants and scholarships
    available to them.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge declined to order Table support, citing a lack of
    evidence regarding the children’s and appellant’s financial means and needs.
    She also stated it would be preferable to employ “an approach [presumably under
    either s.&nbsp;3(2)(b) or s. 7] that takes into account the children’s expenses
    and incomes, as well as the means of each parent and puts into place an
    appropriate budget to be shared by the parties”. The motion judge further noted
    that the Mossip Order provides for the sharing of s. 7 expenses, and that the
    appellant is required to provide an accounting to the respondent under the Mossip
    Order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motion judge did not err in not ordering ongoing child
    support. The onus is on the party seeking support to demonstrate that the adult
    child requires educational support: see <em>Rebenchuk v. Rebenchuk</em>, 2007
    MBCA 22, at para. 63. This consideration arises even before the judge must
    determine whether the presumptive amount or an amount determining by a
    different approach applies. The insufficient evidence provided by the appellant
    failed to discharge that onus. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge concluded that there was inadequate evidence to order
    support beyond the sharing of the s. 7 expenses. I agree with the motion judge
    that the Mossip Order already accounts for the children’s post-secondary
    expenses to be shared by the parties. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the circumstances, I find that the motion judge did not err here.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, a child of the marriage should not be prejudiced by the self-represented
    appellant’s inability to master the intricacies of litigation. If the youngest
    child, in particular, continues to reside with the appellant, the appellant
    likely incurs costs for her shelter and food. The appellant would be at liberty
    to apply for support in addition to the s. 7 expenses, upon presentation of
    adequate evidence, described by the motion judge for the period accruing after
    the October&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2020 order, if so advised.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge determined that the respondent’s increase in income was
    attributable to intervening causes:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The increase in the Applicant’s income is attributable to an
    intervening cause, unrelated to the parties’ marriage or the roles they adopted
    during the marriage. The Applicant’s increase in income is as a result of the
    reorganization of his employment arrangements, with new responsibilities, a new
    marriage, and as a result of significant lifestyle changes he has made since
    the separation including moving to Qatar. The passage of time alone–eight
    years–indicates that the Respondent’s contributions during the marriage are not
    causally related to the Applicant’s post-separation income increases. [Citation

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These are all factual findings which the motion judge was entitled to
    make. In my view, there is no indication that the motion judge misapplied the law
    or misapprehended evidence, and there is no basis to interfere with the

    Support Entitlement was Contractual and No Further Inquiry was Required?</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are three bases for entitlement to support, as explained by the
    Supreme Court in <em>Bracklow v. Bracklow</em>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 420:
    contractual, compensatory, and non-compensatory (also called “needs-based”).
    The contractual entitlement to support reflects “the idea that parties’
    agreements on support should influence their rights and obligations during the
    marriage and upon its breakup”: <em>Bracklow</em>, at para. 18. Under s.
    15.2(4) of the <em>Divorce Act</em>, R.S.C.&nbsp;1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), a
    court must have regard to any “order, agreement or arrangement relating to
    support of either spouse”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The compensatory basis for entitlement applies “where it would be just
    to compensate a spouse for his or her contributions to the marriage or for
    sacrifices made or hardships suffered as a result of the marriage”: <em>Bracklow</em>,
    at para. 18. The court in <em>Bracklow</em>, at para. 39, further notes:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Under the <em>Divorce Act</em>, compensation arguments can be
    grounded in the need to consider the “condition” of the spouse; the “means,
    needs and other circumstances” of the spouse, which may encompass lack of
    ability to support oneself due to foregoing career opportunities during the
    marriage; and “the functions performed by each spouse during cohabitation”,
    which may support the same argument.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the court in <em>Bracklow</em>, at paras. 40-41, describes the
    non-compensatory basis for entitlement. This requires:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…[T]he court consider the “condition, means, needs and other
    circumstances of each spouse”. To be sure, these factors may support arguments
    based on compensation for what happened during the marriage and its breakdown.
    But they invite an inquiry that goes beyond compensation to the actual
    situation of the parties at the time of the application…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…Looking only at compensation, one merely asks what loss the
    marriage or marriage breakup caused that would not have been suffered but for

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These bases for spousal support are complemented by the objectives of variation
    orders for spousal support set out in s. 17(7) of the <em>Divorce Act</em>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>17 (7) A variation order varying a spousal support order should</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(a) recognize any economic advantages or disadvantages to
    the former spouses arising from the marriage or its breakdown;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(b) apportion between the former spouses any financial
    consequences arising from the care of any child of the marriage over and above
    any obligation for the support of any child of the marriage;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(c) relieve any economic hardship of the former spouses
    arising from the breakdown of the marriage; and</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(d) in so far as practicable, promote the economic
    self-sufficiency of each former spouse within a reasonable period of time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is with these policy objectives in mind that the appellant’s motion
    for a variation in spousal support must be assessed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge made the following finding as to the nature of the
    appellant’s entitlement to spousal support:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am satisfied that the Respondent’s [mother] entitlement to
    support is contractual in nature. The Minutes of Settlement and the Final Order
    do not contain any terms permitting the Respondent to seek increased spousal
    support in the future. There was no finding as to her entitlement to
    compensatory or needs based support. While she may have had a claim in this
    regard at the time, it is not the basis upon which the Final Order was made. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that an entitlement to spousal support is not
    contractual simply because an order for support incorporates minutes of
    settlement, and that such an order does not erase any underlying bases for
    entitlement to support. The motion judge erred by failing to determine whether
    the support order should be varied on another basis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that the minutes of settlement create an
    entitlement to support that is only contractual, and the support available to
    the appellant was therefore circumscribed by the terms set out in the Mossip
    Order. Additionally, unlike a judge on an initial application for spousal
    support, the motion judge did not have the discretion to change the terms of
    the spousal support, because once an initial court approves a support order,
    there is a presumption that the terms of the order comply with the <em>Divorce
    Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also concluded that the respondent’s increase in income
    did not constitute a material change in circumstances:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Furthermore, the Respondent’s [appellant on appeal] own
    evidence in her sworn affidavit dated March 2, 2020 contradicts her submissions
    that the Applicant’s increase should be regarded as a material change in
    circumstances. In her affidavit, the Respondent states that the Applicant’s new
    position is exactly in line with what they had discussed when he undertook a
    master’s degree program in social work. It cannot therefore be said that the
    change was not contemplated by the parties at the time they entered into the
    Minutes of Settlement that led to the Final Order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it was an error for the motion judge to hold that the
    appellant’s spousal support could not be varied because the Mossip Order did
    not contain a term permitting variation. While s. 15.2(4)(c) of the <em>Divorce
    Act</em> provides that the court shall consider “any order, agreement or
    arrangement relating to the support of either spouse”, this does not end the
    inquiry required. The appellant’s motion would have been an application under
    s. 17 of the <em>Divorce Act</em> to vary her spousal support. The Supreme
    Court in <em>L.M.P. v. L.S.</em>, 2011 SCC 64, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 775 stated, at
    para. 41, “even where an agreement incorporated into an order includes a term
    providing that it is final, the court’s jurisdiction under s. 17 cannot be
    ousted”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the motion judge was entitled to make a factual finding that the
    evidence regarding the respondent’s income increase did not support a finding
    that there was a material change in circumstances, her analysis fails to ask
    whether the appellant faced a material change in circumstances. The court in <em>L.M.P</em>.,
    at para. 29, is clear that the question of a material change applies to both
    parties: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In determining whether the conditions for variation exist, the
    threshold that must be met before a court may vary a prior spousal support
    order is articulated in s. 17(4.1). A court must consider whether there has
    been a change in the conditions, means, needs or other circumstances of <span
class=Underline>either</span> former spouse <em>since the making of the spousal
    support order</em>. [Italics in original; underlining added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, despite the existence of an order incorporating an agreement,
    a judge retains jurisdiction to consider whether a variation in support should
    be granted based on whether there has been a material change in the circumstances
    of either former spouse, and having regard to any existing agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span lang=EN-US>Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines provide for
    differing amounts of spousal support, depending on whether child support is or
    is not payable. The motion judge declined to order ongoing Table amount child
    support for the middle and youngest children. The reduction or termination of
    child support constitutes a change in circumstances for the purposes of seeking
    a variation in spousal support: </span><em>Divorce Act</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    s. 15.3(3). Therefore, after child support obligations are reduced or cease, a spousal
    support award may increase: see as examples </span><em>Gray&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Gray</em><span

    respondent’s circumstances were sufficiently disconnected from the marriage so
    as to not qualify as a material change in his circumstances, the respondent’s
    means may still be relevant to the determination of the extent to which he is
    now able to temper any continuing economic disadvantage resulting from the
    marriage still suffered by the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was an error for the motion judge not to undertake this analysis,
    especially in light of her recognition that the appellant may have had
    compensatory or needs-based entitlements when the Mossip Order was made. This
    is an error that warrants correction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When spousal support was set at $150 per month, the respondent was
    paying the Table amount of support for three children, plus s. 7 expenses. That
    he is no longer paying Table support for three children constitutes a change in
    circumstances for the purpose of seeking a variation order under s. 15.3(3) of
    the <em>Divorce Act</em>, and therefore satisfies the threshold for variation.
    The question then becomes, what is the appropriate variation? The court in <em>L.M.P</em>.
    provides guidance on the analysis required, at paras. 47 and 50: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>If the s. 17 threshold for variation of a spousal support order
    has been met, a court must determine what variation to the order needs to be
    made in light of the change in circumstances. The court then takes into account
    the material change, and should limit itself to making only the variation justified
    by that change. As Justice L’Heureux-Dubé, concurring in <em>Willick</em>,
    observed: “A variation under the Act is neither an appeal of the original order
    nor a <em>de novo</em> hearing” (p. 739). As earlier stated, as Bastarache and
    Arbour JJ. said in <em>Miglin</em>, “judges making variation orders under s. 17
    limit themselves to making the appropriate variation, but do not weigh all the
    factors to make a fresh order unrelated to the existing one, unless the
    circumstances require the rescission, rather than a mere variation of the
    order”. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In short, once a material change in circumstances has been
    established, the variation order should “properly reflec[t] the objectives set
    out in s. 17(7), . . . [take] account of the material changes in circumstances,
    [and] conside[r] the existence of the separation agreement and its terms as a
    relevant factor” (Hickey, at para. 27). A court should limit itself to making
    the variation which is appropriate in light of the change. The task should not
    be approached as if it were an initial application for support under s. 15.2 of
    the <em>Divorce Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court must first consider the impact of the respondent’s
    post-separation increase in income, which is a complicating factor: see <em>Gray</em>,
    at para. 45. As explained above, the motion judge’s finding that the appellant
    is not entitled to share in the respondent’s post-separation increase in income
    is owed deference. Therefore, the assessment of the appropriate variation should
    proceed using the respondent’s income at the time of the Mossip Order, which was
    $78,528.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appropriate variation is one that will remedy the economic
    disadvantage suffered by the appellant from the roles the parties adopted
    during the marriage. On review of the record, I am satisfied that while both
    parents contributed to household and childcare responsibilities, the majority
    of these responsibilities fell to the appellant and had an impact on her
    ability to pursue her business and career. The respondent completed his MSW
    over three years, during which time he worked two jobs. This would have
    required the appellant to take on increased childcare responsibilities. The
    respondent’s MSW was funded by himself, through his RRSPs and student loans. Though
    she continued to work in pottery in some capacity, the appellant was not able
    to advance her career, unlike the respondent. After the separation, the
    children also resided primarily with the appellant, which continued her
    disadvantage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Guidelines, while not binding, are recognized for their utility in determining
    the quantum and measure of spousal support. On my calculation, at the time of
    the Mossip Order, the range for spousal support under the Guidelines, without
    child support would have been between $1,356 and $1,808 per month. Pursuant to
    the Mossip Order, the appellant received $150 per month. I find that an
    appropriate amount of varied spousal support is in the mid-range, at $1,500. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to duration, the Mossip Order did not time-limit the spousal support
    that would be paid to the appellant. However, I find it appropriate to limit
    the varied spousal support payments to 108 months, which is at the low end for
    what the appellant would have received under the without-child formula at the
    time of the Mossip Order. The record demonstrates that the appellant has been
    able to attain higher income levels since the time of the Mossip Order, and she
    has managed to save money. The appellant is also currently pursuing her Bachelor
    of Arts. Given the appellant’s means and optimistic future, indefinite spousal
    support would not be appropriate. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that this variation is appropriate: it reflects the
    economic disadvantages the appellant suffered as the primary, though not sole,
    caregiver for the family. In my view, it will also promote the appellant’s
    self-sufficiency by providing her the financial security she needs to complete
    her education and make herself competitive in the job market. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, the appeal is allowed in part. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find that the motion judge misapprehended the evidence regarding an
    overpayment of child support, and this affected her analysis of whether there was
    support owing for the youngest child between February 2019 and January 2020. With
    respect to the children’s post-secondary education expenses, I do not find that
    the motion judge made a palpable and overriding error that warrants appellate
    interference.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the motion judge’s findings on the respondent’s
    post-separation increase in income, I do not find that the reasons disclose any
    reversible error; as such, deference is owed to the motion judge’s findings on
    this ground. However, in my view, the motion judge erred by failing to assess
    whether the spousal support order could be varied simply because the order
    incorporated minutes of settlement. I would therefore vary spousal support to $1,500
    per month for 108 months, retroactive to July 1, 2020.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each of the parties may make brief written submissions as to the costs
    of the motion to vary, and the costs of the appeal, due from the appellant
    within 15&nbsp;days after the date of the release of these reasons, and due
