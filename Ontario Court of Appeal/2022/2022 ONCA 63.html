lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After a five-day trial, the appellant was
    convicted of sexual interference and sexual assault of a 14-year-old
    complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was sentenced to 14 months in
    custody, along with a DNA order under ss. 487.04 and 487.051(1) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, an order under s. 490.013(2)(b) of the <em>Code</em> to comply with the <em>Sex Offender Information Registration Act</em> for 20
    years,<em> </em>and prohibitions against possessing weapons and contacting the
    complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant was a friend of the appellant’s
    daughter. She alleged that the assault took place at a construction site where
    the appellant worked and where he had arranged for the complainant to work for
    the day.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During a recess in the trial, the trial judge
    was approached by Linda Pearson, a sitting justice of the peace. The justice of
    the peace had access to the area behind the courtroom reserved for judges and
    court staff. She approached the trial judge there. No one witnessed the
    exchange between the trial judge and the justice of the peace, but the justice
    of the peace had advised trial Crown of her intention to approach the trial
    judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the trial judge, the justice of the
    peace informed him that she was the mother of M.M.’s ex-spouse and the
    grandmother of M.M.’s three children. She sought the trial judge’s “blessing”
    to attend the trial. The trial judge answered that anyone was free to observe
    the trial in the courtroom. The justice of the peace left the judge’s chambers,
    but returned shortly after to tell the trial judge he could “carry on” without
    her because M.M. did not want her watching his trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Upon resuming, the appellant sought a mistrial
    on the basis that the <em>ex parte </em>discussion between the justice of the
    peace and the trial judge gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge dismissed the application for a
    mistrial. He acknowledged that the discussion with the justice of the peace had
    been unfortunate and should not have occurred, but concluded that he was able
    to disabuse himself of the encounter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In convicting the appellant, the trial judge
    applied the framework articulated in <a
href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/741/index.do"><em><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>R. v. W.(D.</span></em></a><em>)</em>,
    [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. When considering the first branch of the <a
href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/741/index.do"><em><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>W.(D.</span></em></a><em>)</em> framework,
    the trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence denying the substance of the
    complainant’s allegations. Specifically, the trial judge rejected the
    appellant’s explanation for sending late night text messages to the
    complainant, noting that the appellant agreed with the suggestion that texting
    the complainant in that way and at that time was “not normal”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then briefly considered the
    second branch of the <em>W.(D.) </em>framework, where he concluded that he was
    not left in a reasonable doubt by the accused’s testimony. Finally, when
    considering the third branch of the <em>W.(D.)</em> framework, the trial judge
    concluded that the complainant’s evidence was sufficiently credible and
    reliable to prove the case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his Notice of Appeal, the appellant raised
    two grounds of appeal relating to the conviction: first, that the trial judge
    erred in not granting the application for a mistrial based on a reasonable
    apprehension of bias in light of his <em>ex parte</em> discussions with the
    justice of the peace; and second, that the trial judge erred in the application
    of the <em>W.(D.)</em> framework.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In oral submissions, the appellant stated he is
    no longer advancing the ground of appeal relating to the trial judge’s
    application of the <em>W.(D.)</em> framework, and is now pursuing only the
    ground of appeal relating to the mistrial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Notice of Appeal also included an appeal
    against the sentence imposed but this ground of appeal was not pursued by the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did the Trial Judge err in dismissing the
    application for a mistrial?</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in finding that his <em>ex parte </em>discussion with the justice of the peace
    did not lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias. While the appellant takes no
    issue with the actual impartiality of the trial judge and acknowledges the high
    burden to displace the presumption of impartiality, he contends that a
    reasonable person would conclude that the trial judge would not decide the case
    fairly based, in part, on the following elements of the <em>ex parte </em>discussion:</span></p>

    justice must not only be done but be seen to be done. With this principle in
    mind, he put the question before him this way: “[W]ould the reasonable person

    did not act improperly when approached by the justice of the peace.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge acknowledged that he was caught
    off guard by the encounter, and that he had never been approached in this way
    during a trial over his 26-27 years on the bench. He stated that, in hindsight,
    counsel for the Crown should have advised the justice of the peace not to speak
    with him in the midst of trial, and that it was not appropriate for her to
    attend. The trial judge also conceded that, although she had the right to do
    so, he himself should have advised the justice of the peace that it would be “unwise”
    for her to attend the trial given her position and relationship with the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the encounters would in no way influence his ability to disabuse his mind of

    was entitled.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the trial judge considered the
    practical implications of a potential mistrial. He noted the additional delay
    which a mistrial would create. He highlighted the difficulty experienced by the
    complainant, who was then in the midst of testifying, and the risk that a new
    trial, including the requirement to testify again before a different judge,
    would significantly worsen her emotional state.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Weighing all of these factors, the trial judge
    concluded that the encounter was “unfortunate” and “should not have occurred”,
    but it did not compromise the fairness of the trial, and that the application

    judge’s <em>ex parte</em> communication with another judicial officer was
    directly at issue. Rather, each party relies on cases involving <em>ex parte</em> communications between judges and counsel, parties or others.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown relies on <em>R. v. Arnold</em>,
    [2000] O.J. No. 3749 (C.A.), in which this court affirmed a lower court
    decision finding no reasonable apprehension of bias where a judge had
    communicated with Crown counsel outside the presence of the defence. In that
    case, the application judge concluded that it is not the mere fact of an <em>ex
    parte</em> communication that gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias
    but rather the content of such communication. Specifically, citing the judgment
    of McLachlin and Major JJ. in <em>R. v. Curragh Inc.</em>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 537,
    at para. 104 (dissenting, but not on this point), the application judge found
    that the content did not create the appearance of bias because it would not
    sway the court to one party’s position.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By contrast, this court found a reasonable
    apprehension of bias in <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;C.D.H.</em>, 2015 ONCA 102, 125
    O.R. (3d) 225, where a trial judge had an <em>ex&nbsp;parte</em> conversation
    with the investigating police officer, because the content of that conversation
    involved a specific view expressed by the trial judge that appeared adverse to
    the complainant in the alleged crime.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While I accept the importance of considering
    whether the content of <em>ex parte</em> communications may create the
    appearance of favouring one party over another, there are circumstances where
    the mere fact of <em>ex parte</em> communications may itself create an
    appearance of bias. Where, as here, a judicial officer approaches a judge in
    order to make the judge aware of her personal interest in the case, the
    appearance of impartiality may be in doubt, depending on how the trial judge
    responds.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, had her conduct stood alone, the
    actions of justice of the peace may well have given rise to an appearance of
    bias. The content of the justice of the peace’s comments revealed both that she
    had a vested interest in the case as the grandmother of the appellant’s children,
    and an acrimonious relationship with the appellant. A reasonable person could
    certainly see this communication as swaying the trial judge to disfavour the appellant
    in a case where credibility would be a significant issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, as indicated, while a third party’s
    conduct may be relevant to the analysis, the focus of the inquiry into a
    reasonable apprehension of bias is the conduct of the judge. In this case, had
    the trial judge done nothing but acknowledge this encounter, a reasonable
    apprehension of bias may well have remained.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge did not, however, do nothing in
    the face of these encounters. Rather, he took deliberate steps to mitigate the appearance
    of unfairness that this unwelcome encounter might have caused, including the
    following:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>he explained in his reasons why he believed he

lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge reasoned that, while the
    encounter may mean that the appellant would not receive a perfect trial, it
    would not mean, when viewed from the perspective of a reasonable observer, that
    the appellant would not receive a fair trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The justice of the peace’s decision to approach
    the trial judge in the midst of the trial to make her interest in the case

    observer would not be more likely than not to conclude that the trial judge was
    biased.</span></p>
