  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Thorburn J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Max Edwin Tutiven (“the appellant”) appeals his conviction for second
    degree murder and seeks leave to appeal his sentence of life imprisonment with
    parole ineligibility for 16 years.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 15, 2012, the appellant went to a gas station on Roselawn
    Avenue in Toronto to steal gasoline. He filled his vehicle and several
    cannisters with gasoline. He had done this many times before and had a lengthy
    criminal record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Prajapati, the gas attendant, noticed that the appellant appeared to
    be leaving without paying. He ran across a lane of vehicles near the gasoline
    pumps toward the appellant with his arms outstretched and shouted “hey hey” in
    an apparent attempt to try and stop him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Prajapati was struck by the front passenger side of the appellant’s
    vehicle. CCTV footage does not show the moment of impact but it is clear that
    Mr.&nbsp;Prajapati was quickly pulled under the appellant’s vehicle while
    several people yelled at the appellant to stop.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Prajapati remained trapped under the vehicle as the appellant sped
    down Roselawn Avenue for approximately 78 metres before his body was dislodged
    from the vehicle. Mr. Prajapati died of multiple blunt and crush injuries.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Witnesses heard screeching tires or the sounds of a loud engine. They
    described the loud dragging sound of Mr. Prajapati’s body. One said the sound
    was akin to a vehicle hitting a pylon, and the pylon getting lodged under the
    vehicle and kicked around, followed by a softer dragging sound. Another witness
    described the sound as “terrible” and sounding “very loudly like a piece of
    cardboard being dragged on … asphalt”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant said he intended to leave the gas station after stealing
    the gasoline but another car parked in front of his car, making it difficult
    for him to leave. The appellant says he was focused on the other car and did
    not see Mr.&nbsp;Prajapati approach but did hear a “hey, hey”. He says he did
    not feel or hear the impact of hitting Mr. Prajapati. The appellant drove out
    of the gas station and onto Roselawn Avenue, hitting the curb as he left the
    station. He said he heard something like “stop, stop” as he was leaving. He
    said he heard what he thought sounded like a pylon dragging under his vehicle.
    He said he was worried about being caught for gasoline theft and his only
    thought was to get out of there as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant said that after driving home that night, he received a
    call from his father advising that the police were looking for him. He assumed
    it was about the gasoline theft and went back to bed. The next day he drove to
    Kingston to see his friend. His friend told him he was wanted by police because
    the gas attendant had died. The appellant said that he went into hiding in
    Montréal because he knew that he was unlikely to get bail, due to his numerous
    prior convictions. He was arrested three years later.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no dispute at trial that the appellant struck Mr. Prajapati
    with his vehicle and that Mr. Prajapati died. The appellant conceded that he
    was guilty of manslaughter. Therefore, the only issue was whether the appellant
    intended to kill Mr. Prajapati.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown contended that the appellant made a “continuous, deliberate, and seamless
    departure” from the gas station and that the appellant saw Mr.&nbsp;Prajapati
    before he hit him. The Crown noted that there was no evidence of pylons at the
    gas station and the appellant admitted to seeing no pylons. The Crown argued
    that the appellant’s testimony was “created to hide the truth”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant admitted to manslaughter, on the basis that he drove dangerously, it
    was objectively foreseeable that there was a risk of bodily harm, and it caused
    Mr. Prajapati’s death. He claimed however that he did not know he hit and was
    dragging Mr. Prajapati, and there were other reasonable inferences for his
    conduct that were inconsistent with the intent for murder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submitted that his post-offence conduct <em>before</em> he learned he
    was wanted for murder, supported his submission that he did not have the intent
    for murder. He submitted that his post-offence conduct <em>after</em> he
    learned he was wanted for murder, was not relevant in determining whether he
    was guilty of murder or manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury convicted the appellant of second-degree murder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the sentencing hearing, the Crown sought a period of parole ineligibility of 17
    years. In the Crown’s view, this period of parole ineligibility was warranted
    as the offence demonstrated a callous disregard for life, it was committed by
    the appellant while he was committing other criminal offences, the appellant’s
    long criminal record demonstrated a commitment to a criminal lifestyle, and
    this offence was committed while he was on a life-time driving prohibition and
    probation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submitted that a 17-year period of parole ineligibility was too harsh
    given that he admitted responsibility and expressed remorse at trial. He
    submitted that a 10 to 12-year period of parole ineligibility should be imposed
    instead.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge held that “[t]here are virtually no mitigating factors in this
    case” and imposed a period of parole ineligibility of 16 years.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE ISSUES ON APPEAL</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals his conviction and seeks leave to appeal his sentence on the
    basis of his assertion that:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge failed to inquire into evidence

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS OF THE ISSUES</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='text-transform:none'>Juror Impartiality</span></h1>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>The appellant’s
    submission about juror partiality</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the challenge for cause process in the selection of jurors, a prospective juror
    said that this case “actually did bother me a lot” given her work with new
    immigrants to Canada. The prospective juror said she did not know whether she
    would be able to set aside her preconceived notions and decide the case fairly.
    The two jurors acting as triers found the prospective juror acceptable. The
    defence exercised a peremptory challenge to exclude the prospective juror.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the conduct of the two jurors in finding the prospective
    juror to be acceptable, created a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part
    of the two jurors. He therefore submits that the trial judge should have
    conducted an inquiry into their impartiality and possibly discharged them. The
    appellant claims that by failing to conduct an inquiry, the trial judge made an
    error of law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the verdict should be set aside on the basis of the
    trial judge’s failure to inquire into juror partiality.</p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA style='font-weight:normal'>Analysis of the
    issue of juror partiality</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    demonstrate partiality, it must be clear that a juror’s beliefs, opinions or
    biases will prevent them from setting aside their preconceptions and deciding
    the case based solely on the evidence: <em>R. v. S. (R.D.), </em>[1997] 3
    S.C.R. 484, at para.&nbsp;107. Impartiality does not require jurors to be
    neutral, but jurors’ life experiences cannot interfere with their
    responsibility to approach the case with “an open mind, one that is free from
    bias, prejudice, or sympathy”: <em>R. v. Chouhan</em>, 2021 SCC 26, at para.
    48, citing <em>R. v. Barton, </em>2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para.
    195.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a strong presumption of juror impartiality: <em>R. v. Dowholis, </em>2016
    ONCA 801, 133 O.R. (3d) 1, at para. 18. The presumption of juror impartiality
    can be rebutted only if a reasonable observer would conclude that the juror’s
    conduct made it more likely than not that the juror, whether consciously or
    unconsciously, would not decide fairly: <em>Dowholis, </em>at para. 17.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for the reasonable apprehension of bias is “what would an informed person,
    viewing the matter realistically and practically – and having thought the
    matter through – conclude”: <em>Committee for Justice and Liberty et al. v.
    National Energy Board et al., </em>[1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, at p. 394, per<em> </em>de
    Grandpré J.; <em>Dowholis, </em>at para. 19.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    threshold for establishing reasonable apprehension of bias is high: <em>S.&nbsp;(R.D.), </em>at paras. 112-113. Further, safeguards are in place to protect against
    potential sources of juror partiality. In <em>R. v. Find, </em>2001 SCC 32,
    [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 107, the Supreme Court explained these safeguards
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he safeguards of the trial process and the
    instructions of the trial judge are designed to replace emotional reactions
    with rational, dispassionate assessment. Our long experience in the context of
    the trial of other serious offences suggests that our faith in this cleansing
    process is not misplaced. The presumption of innocence, the oath or
    affirmation, the diffusive effects of collective deliberation, the requirement
    of jury unanimity, specific directions from the trial judge and counsel, a
    regime of evidentiary and statutory protections, the adversarial nature of the
    proceedings and their general solemnity, and numerous other precautions both
    subtle and manifest – all collaborate to keep the jury on the path to an
    impartial verdict despite offence-based prejudice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    triers’ acceptance of a juror who expressed uncertainty about whether she was
    able to decide the case fairly but did not say that her uncertainty would
    impede her ability to decide the case fairly, does not meet the high threshold

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the trial judge did everything necessary to ensure juror impartiality.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    each trier began to perform their task, the trial judge correctly instructed
    them that, having preconceptions about a case does not necessarily disqualify a
    potential juror and that what is important, is whether the potential juror
    “would likely be able to put their opinions aside and decide the case fairly
    and only on the evidence and legal instructions”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    all the jurors were selected, the trial judge reminded the jury panel of their
    duty to decide the case only on the basis of the evidence they saw and heard
    and to make their decision without “sympathy, prejudice or fear”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s experienced defence counsel raised no concerns and neither party
    asked the judge to conduct a further inquiry into the conduct of the triers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly,
    although following jury selection, the appellant told the court there were “a
    couple things that I’m very, very uncomfortable with, specifically with jury
    selection”, he made no reference to the two jurors who were triers, their
    conduct, or any allegation of possible bias. Concerns about the reasonable
    apprehension of bias should be voiced as soon as reasonably possible: <em>R. v.
    Nero, </em>2016 ONCA 160, 334 C.C.C. (3d) 148, at paras. 33, 36, leave to

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on <em>R. v. Budai</em>, 2001 BCCA 349, 154 C.C.C. (3d) 289,
    leave to appeal refused, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 415, to submit that once aware of
    circumstances which raise a question as to the impartiality of a juror, the
    trial judge must conduct an inquiry into the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    this case is distinguishable from <em>Budai</em> as in <em>Budai, </em>unlike
    this case,<em> </em>the juror’s conduct raised a real possibility of juror misconduct.
    The trial judge had received reports of “improper and continuous eye contact”
    in the courtroom between a juror and an accused, to which the juror made an
    “improper response”, this had been going on for one to two months, and the
    parties had nodded at and recognized one another outside the courtroom: at
    para. 42. This was sufficient to provide a basis for the trial judge’s exercise
    of discretion to conduct an inquiry.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For

    first stage”), and (2) his conduct from the time he knew he was wanted for
    murder, until the time of his arrest in Montréal three years later (“the second

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence adduced on the first stage post-offence conduct was relevant to the

    had the intent for murder. Given that the appellant admitted he was guilty of
    manslaughter, the evidence adduced in respect of the second stage post-offence
    conduct was irrelevant to the issue of whether the death was a manslaughter or
    a murder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span

    contention), but were not told how the post-offence conduct could assist in
    determining whether the Crown had proven its case if it did not apply to
    intent. Specifically, they were not told how a finding that the appellant’s
    actions were consistent with innocence, or consistent with someone who is not
    aware of having committed any serious offence, should factor into their

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span

    trial judge correctly instructed the jury that the post-offence conduct evidence

    a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    were then told <u>how</u> they could use that evidence as follows: “[I]f you
    agree with [appellant’s trial counsel] Mr. Sapiano's position that manslaughter
    has been proven and <u>the only issue is to decide whether the Crown has proven
    the intent for murder, the post-offence conduct evidence cannot be used by you
    at all </u>as evidence pointing to guilt. In those circumstances you should
    ignore it because, in law, it has no probative value in deciding between murder
    and manslaughter” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge went on to say, however, that, “<u>You must consider the
    post-offence conduct evidence that is consistent with innocence</u>. This is
    the evidence that Mr. Tutiven went to his rooming house, left his car parked at
    his rooming house, left when he planned and did not take any steps to hide his
    whereabouts, went to a restaurant in Kingston with his friend. If believed,
    this may be seen as conduct that is consistent with someone who is not aware of
    having committed any serious offence” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question is whether the jury instruction, read in its entirety, in the context
    of the case, properly equipped the jury to decide the case based on the application
    of the applicable legal principles to the evidence: <em>R. v. Badgerow, </em>2019
    ONCA 374, 146 O.R. (3d) 35, at paras. 17-18. This court held in <em>R. v. Adan, </em>2019 ONCA 709, at para. 35, “Whether a trial judge’s instructions were
    sufficient depends on the significance of the nature of the conduct involved;
    the use made of the evidence at trial; the instructions given about its use;

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    a failure by trial counsel to object is not decisive, but is a factor
    warranting consideration on appellate review: <em>Adan, </em>at para. 63; <em>R.
    v. Jacquard</em>,<em> </em>[1997] 1 S.C.R. 314<em>, </em>at para. 38. A failure
    to object to an instruction later advanced as erroneous on appeal “may say
    something about the overall accuracy of the instructions, the fairness of the
    charge, and the seriousness of the alleged misdirection”: <em>Aden, </em>at

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jurors were told they could not use the evidence to determine that the
    appellant had the intent necessary for murder, but they could use the evidence,
    to the extent it was consistent with innocence, to support a finding that the
    appellant was not aware of having committed any serious offence. Those
    instructions were correct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury would have understood that they could use the evidence to negate <em>mens

    this evidence insofar as it is consistent with the appellant’s innocence both
    of the act and the intention to commit the act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s experienced trial counsel did not object to this instruction.
    During pre-charge discussions, the appellant’s trial counsel initially
    requested that the trial judge include after-the-fact conduct consistent with
    innocence in the portion of the charge on intent for murder, but then abandoned
    the request.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An <em>O’Connor</em> instruction is given where the Crown seeks to have the trier
    of fact <u>draw an adverse inference</u> on the basis of an alleged fabrication
    of an exculpatory statement by the accused, and the Crown can prove fabrication
    based on independent evidence: <em>R. v. O’Connor </em>(2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 263
    (C.A.), at paras. 35-37; <em>R. v. Al-Enzi</em>, 2021 ONCA 81, 401 C.C.C. (3d)

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    law distinguishes between an exculpatory statement given by an accused that is
    disbelieved, and one that is determined to have been fabricated to avoid
    culpability: <em>R. v. Wright</em>, 2017 ONCA 560, 354 C.C.C. (3d) 377, at
    para. 38; <em>Al-Enzi, </em>at para. 38.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    statement that is disbelieved is not evidence that strengthens the Crown’s
    case. It is simply determined to be untrue: <em>Al-Enzi, </em>at para. 38. On
    the other hand, a statement that was deliberately fabricated can support an
    inference of guilt because the trier of fact can draw an inference that the
    accused lied to conceal their guilt: <em>Al-Enzi</em>,<em> </em>at para. 38.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. Coutts</em> (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 198 (C.A.), at p. 203, leave to

    the distinction between disbelief and fabrication:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If triers of fact were routinely told that
    they could infer concoction from disbelief and use that finding of concoction
    as evidence of guilt, it would be far too easy to equate disbelief of an
    accused’s version of events with guilt and to proceed automatically from
    disbelief of an accused to a guilty verdict. That line of reasoning ignores the
    Crown’s obligation to prove an accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. By
    limiting resort to concoction as a separate piece of circumstantial evidence to
    situations where there is evidence of concoction apart from evidence which
    contradicts or discredits the version of events advanced by the accused, the
    law seeks to avoid convictions founded ultimately on the disbelief of the
    accused's version of events.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    the Crown asserts fabrication, the Crown must not only adduce evidence that
    disproves the exculpatory statement, but also adduce independent evidence that
    proves that the exculpatory statement was made to deflect from the accused’s
    guilt: <em>Al-Enzi</em>,<em> </em>at para. 39. Where independent evidence of
    fabrication exists, the trier of fact should be made aware of the principles
    governing the use to which they can put the statement: <em>Al-Enzi, </em>at
    para. 41.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question to be addressed when an appellant asserts that an <em>O’Connor </em>instruction
    was warranted “is not whether an <em>O’Connor </em>instruction would have been
    appropriate, but whether the instruction given prejudiced the appellant’s right
    to a fair trial”: <em>R. v. Polimac, </em>2010 ONCA 346, 254 C.C.C. (3d) 359,
    at para. 106, leave to appeal refused, [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 263; <em>Al-Enzi, </em>at
    para. 43. An appellate court should undertake a functional assessment of the
    charge, read as a whole in the context of the specific case, giving significant
    weight to the position advanced by trial counsel: <em>R. v. Badgerow, </em>2019
    ONCA 374, 146 O.R. (3d) 35, at paras. 17-19; <em>Al-Enzi, </em>at para. 44.
    Further, this court has recognized that a trial judge’s instruction
    highlighting the circumstances supporting fabrication may in fact work to the
    detriment of the accused as it may serve to emphasize the powerful case
    supporting fabrication: <em>Polimac, </em>at para. 106; <em>Al-Enzi, </em>at
    para. 45.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, no <em>O’Connor</em> instruction was required as the Crown was not
    seeking to have the trier of fact draw an inference of guilt on the basis of an
    alleged fabrication of an exculpatory statement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    closing submissions, Crown counsel referenced the appellant’s “false narrative”
    and characterized his account of events as incredible, suggesting that he was
    hiding the truth. Crown counsel stated that, “you should reject Mr. Tutiven’s
    false narrative.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel submitted that, “Throughout his testimony, rather than answering simple
    questions, Mr. Tutiven repeatedly chose to provide what the Crown would
    characterize as unresponsive answers filled with extra details to camouflage

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[…]</span></p>

    His evidence was convoluted and often contradictory. He was inconsistent, and
    the Crown would say, incredible. He demonstrated no commitment to tell the
    truth. On the contrary, his testimony had all the hallmarks of an individual

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    while Crown counsel asserted that the appellant did not tell the truth, he did

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    although the trial judge summarized the Crown’s position, including that the
    appellant “demonstrated no commitment to tell the truth”, the trial judge did
    not include anything in the jury charge from which the jury could have
    understood that they could draw a negative inference if they disbelieved the
    appellant’s account.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the contrary, she emphasized the requirement that the jury be convinced of the
    appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the entirety of the evidence
    even if the appellant's evidence failed to raise a reasonable doubt. Further,
    trial counsel for the appellant did not request an instruction on the fact that
    evidence of disbelief could not be used to infer guilt.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. Badiru, </em>2012 ONCA 124,<em> </em>this court held that an <em>O’Connor </em>instruction on the distinction between disbelief and a finding of
    fabrication was not necessary, despite the fact that the Crown had stated in
    closing submissions that the appellant’s testimony was fabricated: at para. 23.
    This court held that an instruction was not mandatory as the allegedly false
    statement was part of defence evidence, the trial judge gave an adequate <em>W.(D.) </em>instruction, the Crown did not ask the jury to infer guilt from disbelief,
    and the defence at trial did not request the instruction sought on appeal: at

    verdict is reasonable if it is a verdict “that a properly instructed jury
    acting judicially could reasonably have rendered”: <em>R. v. Villaroman, </em>2016
    SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at para. 55.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s case for establishing the <em>mens rea </em>for murder was entirely
    circumstantial. In circumstantial cases, the trier of fact must be satisfied
    that the appellant’s guilt is the only reasonable conclusion available on the
    totality of the evidence: <em>Villaroman, </em>at para. 55.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    assessing circumstantial evidence, the trier of fact should consider other
    reasonable possibilities inconsistent with guilt. Other possibilities “must be
    reasonable given the evidence and the absence of evidence, assessed logically,
    and in light of human experience and common sense”, and not based on
    speculation: <em>Villaroman, </em>at paras. 36-37.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the evidence does not have to completely exclude other conceivable inferences
    and a “verdict is not unreasonable simply because ‘the alternatives do not
    raise a doubt’ in the jury’s mind”: <em>Villaroman</em>, at para. 556. It is
    ultimately for the trier of fact to determine if a proposed inference is
    reasonable enough to raise a doubt: <em>Villaroman, </em>at para. 56.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge properly cautioned the jury against too readily drawing inferences
    of guilt based on the circumstantial evidence: <em>Villaroman, </em>at para.
    30. She instructed them that,</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Y]ou cannot reach a verdict of guilty based
    on circumstantial evidence unless you were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the guilt of Mr. Tutiven is the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn
    from the whole of the evidence. In this case, the evidence relied upon by the
    Crown to prove Mr. Tutiven’s state of mind is entirely circumstantial. It is
    important that in considering the circumstantial evidence of Mr. Tutiven’s
    state of mind … you consider other reasonable conclusions that are consistent
    with the evidence or with the lack of evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[…]</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence of his intention, other than his
    own evidence of what he intended, is entirely circumstantial. You can rely on
    circumstantial evidence to conclude that Mr. Tutiven intended to apply force.
    You should remember, however, that before relying on circumstantial evidence to
    infer guilt you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of
    Mr. Tutiven is the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the whole of the
    evidence on this issue of his intention to apply force. Before inferring guilt,
    you must consider whether there are other reasonable inferences available from
    the evidence or lack of evidence.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence of intent that could point to

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to decide whether the appellant was guilty of manslaughter or murder, the
    only issues the jury had to decide were whether (a) the appellant saw Mr.
    Prajapati before he ran him over, or (b) the appellant became aware sometime
    after hitting Mr. Prajapati that he was dragging a person underneath his car
    and did not stop driving. If the Crown proved either, the requirement of intent
    for murder pursuant to s. 229(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Code </em>was
    satisfied.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    instant that Mr. Prajapati was run over was not captured on CCTV footage.
    However, before he was hit, Mr. Prajapati can be seen in CCTV footage moving
    forward toward the appellant’s vehicle after seeing the appellant fill his tank
    with gasoline and appearing to leave without paying. The gas station was
    brightly lit and Mr. Prajapati wore a bright yellow and red Shell uniform that
    was plainly visible. A witness testified that Mr. Prajapati shouted “hey” in an
    apparent attempt to stop the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CCTV
    footage shows that the appellant’s vehicle briefly flashed its brake lights,
    then moved forward from pump five, in lane three, into lane two in the very
    direction Mr. Prajapati was running. In another CCTV video, Mr. Prajapati
    appeared running toward the front passenger side of the appellant’s vehicle,
    with his hands raised. The CCTV footage suggests that the appellant was not
    engaged in complex driving manoeuvres at the moment Mr. Prajapati was struck
    and therefore was not distracted before he sped away.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the appellant sped away from the gas station, Mr. Prajapati’s body was under
    the appellant’s vehicle. Mr. Prajapati weighed approximately 70 kilograms and
    his body was dragged approximately 78 metres before it was dislodged from the
    vehicle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    witnesses who were at the gas station testified that they saw Mr.&nbsp;Prajapati
    stand in front of the appellant’s vehicle with his hands raised trying to stop
    the vehicle when the vehicle accelerated. The witnesses testified that the vehicle
    hit him, and then kept driving, dragging Mr. Prajapati.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the witnesses, who was inside his car with the window down during the
    incident, said that as Mr. Prajapati was dragged down the street, he could hear
    people screaming for the driver to stop from their balconies in a nearby
    apartment building on Roselawn Avenue. Another witness in the apartment
    building, heard the vehicle leave the scene, dragging something, and then heard
    the dragging stop and someone yell, “Call 911”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant said that he heard what he thought was a pylon under the vehicle but
    he agreed that he did not see a pylon in or around the gas station.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant suggests that Mr. Prajapati could have tripped and fallen in front of
    the appellant’s vehicle. The appellant’s trial counsel did not raise this
    suggestion to any of the Crown witnesses. This suggestion was advanced for the
    first time in the defence closing address. Further, there is no evidence or
    lack of evidence to support this submission. A witness described that Mr.
    Prajapati was upright, with his hands up to stop the vehicle, when he was hit,
    and that his hands made contact with the hood of the vehicle. The jury,
    properly instructed, was entitled to reject this submission as not being a
    reasonable possibility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken
    together, the fact that Mr. Prajapati was hit from the front passenger side of
    the appellant’s vehicle in a well-lit area wearing brightly-coloured clothing,
    that Mr. Prajapati’s 70 kilograms were dragged under the appellant’s vehicle
    for approximately 78 metres, many witnesses heard the body being dragged,
    people screamed that he stop, the appellant heard a “hey, hey” before he left
    the gas station and something like “stop, stop” as he was leaving, and that he
    felt his vehicle dragging something as he left, were sufficient to enable the
    jury to conclude that the appellant was guilty of second degree murder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was ample evidence to allow the jury to (a) reject the possibility that Mr.
    Prajapati tripped and fell in front of the appellant’s vehicle just as the
    appellant was speeding away, and (b) be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the appellant either saw Mr. Prajapati and deliberately ran him over, or
    realized after he struck Mr. Prajapati that he was dragging someone under his
    vehicle and continued to speed away without stopping.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span

    Crown sought 17 years’ parole ineligibility, the appellant sought 10 to 12
    years, and the sentencing judge imposed a period of 16 years’ parole
    ineligibility. The appellant claims this is excessive and fails to consider his
    remorse and acceptance of responsibility as a mitigating factor.</p>

    decisions are subject to deference and will only be varied where (i) the
    sentence is demonstrably unfit, or (ii) the sentencing judge made an error in
    principle that had an impact on the sentence imposed, including an error of
    law, a failure to consider a relevant factor, or erroneous consideration of an
    aggravating or mitigating factor on sentencing: <em>R. v. Lacasse, </em>2015
    SCC 64, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at paras. 41-44; <em>R. v. Friesen</em>, 2020 SCC

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the sentencing judge did not fail to consider that the appellant
    took some responsibility for what he had done. She determined however that no
    mitigating value attached to it, as his was a “late admission of some limited
    responsibility” after three years spent evading arrest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
